1. DMIL Examples using a slave DLL.

   DMIL examples using a slave DLL fall into 2 categories:

   - Client and server are running on the same platform; for example, the client is 
     Windows 7 64bit and the server is Windows 8 64bit.
   - Client and server are running on different platforms; for example, the client 
     is Windows 7 64bit and the server is Linux or Windows 7 32bit.

   1.1 Same platform.

       The example will take the DLL built on the client computer (which was copied 
       to the MIL DLLs folder as a post-build event), copy it to the server, and use it.

       In this case, you can modify the slave DLL on the client system and it 
       will be used by the server system.

       Under Windows, if User Access Control (UAC) is enabled, note the following: 
       - Client:
         - The DLL will not be copied to the MIL DLLs folder after linking.
       - Server:
         - The DLL will not be copied to its MIL DLLs folder when running the example.
         - The example will check if a slave DLL is present and continue if a DLL is there.

   1.2 Different platforms

       The example will check if a slave DLL is present on the server system and 
       continue if the file exists. For the slave DLL to exist, you need to rebuild 
       the example on the server system.

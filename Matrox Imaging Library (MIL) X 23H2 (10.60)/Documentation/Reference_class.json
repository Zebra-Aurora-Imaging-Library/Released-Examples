      "text": " MclassAlloc Synopsis Allocate a classifier context, a dataset context, a data preparation context, a statistics classification context, or a training context. Syntax MIL_ID MclassAlloc( MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ContextType, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*ContextClassIdPtr //out ) Description This function allocates a classifier context, a dataset context, a data preparation context, a statistics classification context, or a training context on the specified system. These contexts are for anomaly detection, feature classification, image classification, object detection, or segmentation. In general, classifier contexts and dataset contexts are for training (MclassTrain()) and prediction (MclassPredict()), while training contexts, dataset contexts, and data preparation contexts are for training. You can import data to, and export data from, a dataset context by calling MclassImport() and MclassExport(). Datasets are typically exported after they are created and imported the next time they are needed. When a context is no longer required, release it using MclassFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during allocation; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the context's lifetime and you must not manually free it. Parameters Parameters SysId Specifies the identifier of the system on which to allocate the context. Set this parameter to one of the following values. For specifying the system Value Description M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). ContextType Specifies the type of context to allocate. Set this parameter to one of the following values.

For specifying no predefined classifier Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies no predefined classifier context. M_DEFAULT is the only possible setting if you are not allocating a predefined classifier context. If you specify M_DEFAULT when allocating a predefined classifier context (M_CLASSIFIER_CNN_PREDEFINED, M_CLASSIFIER_DET_PREDEFINED, M_CLASSIFIER_ANO_PREDEFINED, or M_CLASSIFIER_SEG_PREDEFINED), you cannot directly train that classifier. In this case, you would typically copy a resulting trained classifier into that context (MclassCopyResult()). To specify a predefined CNN classifier (for M_CLASSIFIER_CNN_PREDEFINED), set the ControlFlag parameter to one of the following values. These classifiers are for image classification. They place no restriction on the minimum size of the training images (though they must all be the same size).

Parameters ClassIndex Set this parameter to the following: 0 &lt;= Value &lt; M_NUMBER_OF_CLASSES Specifies the index of the class definition to control. You can inquire the total number of class definition indices, using M_NUMBER_OF_CLASSES. M_CONTEXT Specifies to control a global setting of a classifier context, dataset context, or data preparation context (for image data). M_DEFAULT_SOURCE_LAYER Specifies to control the input (initial) layer of the classifier in a classification context (for example, the source layer of the ONNX classifier). In this case, you must set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a predefined CNN, object detection, segmentation, anomaly detection, or an ONNX classifier. M_GENERAL Specifies to control a general setting of a classification result buffer. ControlType Specifies the type of control to set. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ControlValue Specifies the required value for the control. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Parameter associations The tables below list possible values for the ControlType and ControlValue parameters. For a classifier context (segmentation or ONNX) For a classifier context (ONNX) For a classifier context (object detection) For a classifier context (object detection or anomaly detection) For a dataset context (images) For a dataset context (images or features) For a classifier or dataset context For a class definition in a classifier or dataset context (for CNN, object detection, segmentation, anomaly detection, tree ensemble, or ONNX) For a classifier context's source layer (ONNX) For a data preparation context (images) For a data preparation context (images) or a training context (anomaly detection or tree ensemble) For a classifier or training context (CNN, object detection, segmentation, anomaly detection, or tree ensemble) For a training context (CNN, object detection, segmentation, anomaly detection) For a training context (CNN, object detection or segmentation) For a training context (CNN, segmentation, or feature classification) For a training context (segmentation) For a training context (anomaly detection) For a training context (segmentation or tree ensemble) For a training context (tree ensemble) For a training result buffer (CNN, object detection, segmentation, or tree ensemble) For a prediction result buffer (CNN, object detection, segmentation, tree ensemble, or ONNX) or a dataset (images or features) For a prediction result buffer (object detection) For a prediction or training result buffer (CNN, object detection, segmentation, tree ensemble, or ONNX) For statistics classification To control a global setting of a predefined segmentation or ONNX classifier context, the ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be set to one of the following values, unless otherwise specified. In this case, set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a predefined segmentation or ONNX classifier context, and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CONTEXT. For a classifier context (segmentation or ONNX) ControlType Description ControlValue M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_X Sets the X-size of the target image with which to call MclassPredict(), when using CSNet (M_CSNET_...) predefined segmentation classifiers, FCNet (M_FCNET_...) predefined legacy classifiers, or M_CLASSIFIER_ONNX ONNX classifiers. By default, MIL assumes the target image size is the same as the default source layer size, which you can retrieve, using MclassInquire() with M_SIZE_X and M_SIZE_Y. M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_X and M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_Y must both be set to M_DEFAULT (or 0), or they must both be greater or equal to M_SIZE_X and M_SIZE_Y. For CSNets, any target image size is allowed. Typically, cropping is the only valid method for predicting on different sized images. Resized images should not be used for prediction unless your classifier was trained using similarly resized images. For legacy FCNet classifiers, the increment by which you can increase the dimensions of the target image depends on the size of the classifier's source layer and step. The following calculations indicate how to establish these dimensions: M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_X = M_SIZE_X + m * M_STEP_X , where m is an integer that is greater than or equal to 0. M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_Y = M_SIZE_Y + n * M_STEP_Y , where n is an integer that is greater than or equal to 0. For ONNX classifiers, M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_X must be set to a value greater than 0 if the X-size of the network is defined by the target image X-size; that is, if inquiring M_SIZE_X returns M_DEFINED_BY_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_X. Otherwise, M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_X must be set to 0 (M_DEFAULT). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. By default, MIL assumes the target image size is the same as the default source layer size. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the X-size. M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_Y Sets the Y-size of the target image with which to call MclassPredict(), when using CSNet (M_CSNET_...) predefined segmentation classifiers, FCNet (M_FCNET_...) predefined legacy classifiers, or M_CLASSIFIER_ONNX ONNX classifiers. By default, MIL assumes the target image size is the same as the default source layer size, which you can retrieve, using MclassInquire() with M_SIZE_X and M_SIZE_Y. M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_X and M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_Y must both be set to M_DEFAULT (or 0), or they must both be greater or equal to M_SIZE_X and M_SIZE_Y. For CSNets, any target image size is allowed. Typically, cropping is the only valid method for predicting on different sized images. Resized images should not be used for prediction unless your classifier was trained using similarly resized images. For legacy FCNet classifiers, the increment by which you can increase the dimensions of the target image depends on the size of the classifier's source layer and step. The following calculations indicate how to establish these dimensions: M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_X = M_SIZE_X + m * M_STEP_X , where m is an integer that is greater than or equal to 0. M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_Y = M_SIZE_Y + n * M_STEP_Y , where n is an integer that is greater than or equal to 0. For ONNX classifiers, M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_Y must be set to a value greater than 0 if the Y-size of the network is defined by the target image Y-size; that is, if inquiring M_SIZE_Y returns M_DEFINED_BY_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_Y. Otherwise, M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_Y must be set to 0 (M_DEFAULT). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. By default, MIL assumes the target image size is the same as the default source layer size. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the Y-size. To control a global setting of an ONNX classifier context, the ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be set to one of the following values, unless otherwise specified. In this case, set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of an ONNX classifier context, and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CONTEXT. For a classifier context (ONNX) ControlType Description ControlValue M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_BAND Sets the number of bands of the target image with which to call MclassPredict(). M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_BAND must be set to a value greater than 0 if the number of input bands of the network is defined by the target image; that is, if inquiring M_SIZE_BAND returns M_DEFINED_BY_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_BAND. Otherwise, M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_BAND must be set to 0 (M_DEFAULT). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. By default, MIL assumes the number of bands of the target image is the same as the number of bands of the default source layer. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the number of bands. To control a global setting of a predefined object detection classifier context, the ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be set to one of the following values, unless otherwise specified. In this case, set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a predefined object detection classifier context, and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CONTEXT. For a classifier context (object detection) ControlType Description ControlValue M_NMS_IOU_THRESHOLD Sets the intersection over union (IOU) threshold value used by the non-maximum suppression (NMS) algorithm to determine if a given box proposal is already covered by an existing box proposal. MIL proposes many overlapping boxes that must be filtered. Of the two overlapping proposals, the one with the lowest detection score will be discarded. The higher the IOU threshold value, the more similarity is required between the boxes before one is discarded. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 25.0. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the IOU threshold. M_NMS_POST_K Sets the maximum number of detections to keep after applying the non-maximum suppression (NMS) algorithm to the detection results specified by M_NMS_TOP_K. The rest of the detections will be discarded. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 100. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the number of detections to keep. M_NMS_TOP_K Sets the top K number of detection results (in terms of score) that will have the non-maximum suppression (NMS) algorithm applied. A lower value reduces the computation complexity of the algorithm. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1000. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the number of top detection results. To control a global setting of a predefined object detection classifier context or a predefined anomaly detection classifier context, the ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be set to one of the following values, unless otherwise specified. In this case, set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a predefined object detection classifier context or a predefined anomaly detection, and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CONTEXT. For a classifier context (object detection or anomaly detection) ControlType Description ControlValue M_SCORE_THRESHOLD Sets the minimum score threshold for a successful detection result. For object detection, only scores above this threshold are kept. For anomaly detection, images or pixels above this score are considered anomalous. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 50.0. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the score threshold. To control a global setting of a dataset context, the ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be set to the following values. In this case, set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a dataset context. Unless otherwise specified, the following values apply to an images dataset context and you should set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CONTEXT. For a dataset context (images) ControlType Description ControlValue M_ANOMALOUS Sets whether the specified class is considered anomalous. To use this setting, LabelOrIndex must be set to M_CLASS_INDEX(). M_DEFAULT Same as M_FALSE. M_FALSE Specifies that images containing this class, either at the image or pixel level, will not be considered anomalous unless it also contains a class with M_ANOMALOUS set to M_TRUE. M_TRUE Specifies that images containing this class, either at the image or pixel level, will be considered anomalous. M_STOP_PREPARE Stops the current execution of MclassPrepareData() on a dataset. This can only be done from another thread of higher priority, or from a user-defined classification hook function. If you stop the data preparation, MclassPrepareData() does not return any images in its destination folder. MIL applies M_STOP_PREPARE on the destination dataset specified with MclassPrepareData(). M_STOP_PREPARE does not apply when you call MclassPrepareData() with images. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default behavior. To control a global setting of a dataset context, the ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be set to the following values. In this case, set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a dataset context. Unless otherwise specified, the following values apply to an images or features dataset context and you should set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CONTEXT. For a dataset context (images or features) ControlType Description ControlValue M_ACTIVE_AUTHOR_INDEX Sets the author that is automatically added to labeling operations performed on a dataset context. MIL uses the current user unless you specify a different one. M_DEFAULT Same as M_CURRENT_USER. M_AUTHOR_INDEX( MIL_INT AuthorIndex ) Specifies the index identifying the author that is automatically defined for each dataset entry. You can only specify the index of an existing author. Use M_AUTHOR_ADD to add a new author. Parameters AuthorIndex Set this parameter to the following. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;M_NUMBER_OF_AUTHORS Specifies the index. You can inquire the total number of author indices, using M_NUMBER_OF_AUTHORS. M_CURRENT_USER Specifies the system's current username as the author that is automatically defined for each dataset entry. If the system's current user name does not exist in the dataset, MIL adds at its end. Note that, in this case, authors are considered the same if their respective names are the same (regardless of their index). M_ACTIVE_AUTHOR_UPDATE Sets the behavior of the entry's author after a modification was performed on the entry. When disabled, changing an entry will never change its author's name. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ENABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to keep the existing author's information. M_ENABLE Specifies that when an entry's information (an entry's region information) is modified, its author is automatically modified according to M_ACTIVE_AUTHOR_INDEX. M_ANOMALY_DETECTION_FOLDER Sets the path at which to save the anomaly detection scores. When working with relative paths, you must set the anomaly detection folder to be under the root path. This value only applies to an images dataset context. MIL_TEXT(\"///DATASET///\") 1 Specifies the folder path from where the dataset context is restored, using MclassRestore(). If this path does not exist, MIL uses the path in which your application's executable file is located. Note, if using a C compiler, you must pass the value as M_PTR_TO_MIL_INT(MIL_TEXT(\"///DATASET///\")). MIL_TEXT(\"SegmentationFilePath\") 1 Specifies the anomaly detection file path. For example, you can specify the root path as, MIL_TEXT(\"E:\\\\Manual\\AnomalyDetection\\Good\"). Note, if using a C compiler, you must pass the value as M_PTR_TO_MIL_INT(MIL_TEXT(\"SegmentationFilePath\")). M_AUTHOR_ADD Adds a new author to a dataset context, according to the specified name. Added authors are given an index and a key (UUID). Once you add an author, you can refer to it in a dataset's entries. MIL_TEXT(\"NewAuthorName\") 1 Specifies the name of the author to add. Note, if using a C compiler, you must pass the value as M_PTR_TO_MIL_INT(MIL_TEXT(\"NewAuthorName\")). M_AUTHOR_DELETE Deletes authors from a dataset context, according to the specified index. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ALL. M_AUTHOR_INDEX( MIL_INT Index ) Specifies the authors to delete from the dataset context. Note that you cannot delete the active author specified with M_ACTIVE_AUTHOR_INDEX. Parameters Index Set this parameter to the following: IndexValue Specifies the index of the author to delete. M_ALL Specifies to delete all explicitly added authors. MIL does not delete the active author (M_ACTIVE_AUTHOR_INDEX). M_AUTHOR_DELETE_BY_KEY Deletes an author from a dataset context, according to the specified key (UUID). MIL_UUID Value Specifies the key of the author to delete. The key is defined as a MIL universal unique identifier (UUID). To specify a MIL_UUID value when using a C compiler, you must call the MIL_UUID version of this function (MclassControlMilUuid). When using a C++ or other compiler, MclassControl() internally calls the MIL_UUID version of this function. MIL_UUID version of MclassControl void MclassControlMilUuid (MIL_ID ContextOrResultClassId, MIL_INT64 LabelOrIndex, MIL_INT64 ControlType, MIL_UUID ControlValue) M_AUTHOR_NAME Sets the name of an author in the dataset context. You must set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_AUTHOR_INDEX(). MIL_TEXT(\"AuthorName\") 1 Specifies the name of an author. This name replaces the current author's name. Note, if using a C compiler, you must pass the value as M_PTR_TO_MIL_INT(MIL_TEXT(\"AuthorName\")). M_CONSOLIDATE_ENTRIES_INTO_FOLDER Copies and reorganizes a dataset according to a specified destination directory. The structure of the directory follows the same one as MclassExport() without the icons and CSV files. In general, this means that within the destination folder, images of the dataset will be copied to the Images folder by class. If the dataset holds segmentation data, mask regions will be copied in the Masks folder and segmentation scores will be copied in the Segmentation folder. The paths of all entries, masks, and segmentation files are updated, as well as the Mask (M_REGION_MASKS_FOLDER), Segmentation (M_SEGMENTATION_FOLDER), and M_ANOMALY_DETECTION_FOLDER folders. Source files are not affected by this control type. It is recommended that you specify an empty destination folder each time you use M_CONSOLIDATE_ENTRIES_INTO_FOLDER.&nbsp;Class folders that already exist in the destination are not recreated. Existing files within that folder that have conflicting names are overwritten. Existing files without conflicting names remain unaffected. Entries without a ground truth are placed in the Images folder. Characters that are illegal in Windows file paths are replaced by the underscore character regardless of the operating system used. The maximum size of the file path is 259 characters. If this maximum is exceeded, MIL attempts to shorten the folder class names. This value only applies to an images dataset context. MIL_TEXT(\"///DATASET///\") 1 Specifies the folder path from where the dataset context is restored, using MclassRestore(). If this path does not exist, MIL uses the path in which your application's executable file is located. Note, if using a C compiler, you must pass the value as M_PTR_TO_MIL_INT(MIL_TEXT(\"///DATASET///\")). MIL_TEXT(\"Path\\\\ToDstFolder\") 1 Specifies the file path. For example, you can specify \"C:\\\\ILoveMatrox\\\\Dest\". Note, relative paths are supported; paths must not end with '\\\\'. Note, if using a C compiler, you must pass the value as M_PTR_TO_MIL_INT(MIL_TEXT(\"Path\\\\ToDstFolder\")). M_DONT_CARE_CLASS_DRAW_COLOR Sets the color given for all regions where the value for M_CLASS_INDEX_GROUND_TRUTH has been set to M_DONT_CARE_CLASS. The effect of this value can be seen in MclassDrawEntry() with M_GROUND_TRUTH_IMAGE + M_PSEUDO_COLOR where any pixels assigned to M_DONT_CARE_CLASS will be given this color. The effect of this value can also be seen in MclassEntryAddRegion() with M_GROUND_TRUTH_IMAGE_COLOR where any pixels of this color in the input image buffer will be added as a region with M_CLASS_INDEX_GROUND_TRUTH set to M_DONT_CARE_CLASS. This value only applies to an images dataset context. M_DEFAULT Same as M_COLOR_DONT_CARE_CLASS. M_RGB888( MIL_INT Red, MIL_INT Green, MIL_INT Blue ) Specifies the RGB value to use as the region's color. Parameters Red Specifies the red component, as a value between 0 and 255. Green Specifies the green component, as a value between 0 and 255. Blue Specifies the blue component, as a value between 0 and 255. M_COLOR_BLACK Specifies the color black. M_COLOR_BLUE Specifies the color blue. M_COLOR_BRIGHT_GRAY Specifies the color bright gray. M_COLOR_CYAN Specifies the color cyan. M_COLOR_DARK_BLUE Specifies the color dark blue. M_COLOR_DARK_CYAN Specifies the color dark cyan. M_COLOR_DARK_GREEN Specifies the color dark green. M_COLOR_DARK_MAGENTA Specifies the color dark magenta. M_COLOR_DARK_RED Specifies the color dark red. M_COLOR_DARK_YELLOW Specifies the color dark yellow. M_COLOR_DONT_CARE_CLASS Specifies the color (255, 255, 255). M_COLOR_GRAY Specifies the color gray. M_COLOR_GREEN Specifies the color green. M_COLOR_LIGHT_BLUE Specifies the color light blue. M_COLOR_LIGHT_GRAY Specifies the color light gray. M_COLOR_LIGHT_GREEN Specifies the color light green. M_COLOR_LIGHT_WHITE Specifies the color light white. M_COLOR_MAGENTA Specifies the color magenta. M_COLOR_RED Specifies the color red. M_COLOR_WHITE Specifies the color white. M_COLOR_YELLOW Specifies the color yellow. M_ENTRY_ADD Adds a new entry to a dataset context. MIL adds a new entry after the last one. For every entry you add, MIL generates a key (MIL_UUID) to uniquely identify that entry. For an images dataset, this automatically adds a full frame region that you can refer to using index 0. You can import data, such as entries, from a CSV file to a dataset context, using MclassImport(). You can also use MIL CoPilot to interactively create, modify, and export datasets and their entries. M_DEFAULT Implements the default behavior. M_ENTRY_DELETE Deletes an entry from a dataset context, according to the specified index. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= M_NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES Specifies the index of the entry to delete. The default value is 0. M_ENTRY_DELETE_ALL Deletes all entries in a dataset context. M_DEFAULT Implements the default behavior. M_ENTRY_DELETE_BY_KEY Deletes an entry from a dataset context, according to the specified key (UUID). MIL_UUID Value Specifies the key of the entry to delete. The key is defined as a MIL universal unique identifier (UUID). To specify a MIL_UUID value when using a C compiler, you must call the MIL_UUID version of this function (MclassControlMilUuid). When using a C++ or other compiler, MclassControl() internally calls the MIL_UUID version of this function. MIL_UUID version of MclassControl void MclassControlMilUuid (MIL_ID ContextOrResultClassId, MIL_INT64 LabelOrIndex, MIL_INT64 ControlType, MIL_UUID ControlValue) M_MAKE_FILE_PATHS_ABSOLUTE Makes the file path of every entry in a dataset context into an absolute path. This is done by concatenating the current root path (M_ROOT_PATH value) to the relative path (M_ENTRY_IMAGE_PATH, M_REGION_MASK_PATH, M_SEGMENTATION_PATH, M_ANOMALY_DETECTION_PATH M_REGION_MASKS_FOLDER, M_SEGMENTATION_FOLDER, and M_ANOMALY_DETECTION_FOLDER) of all entries. This results in every entry having a complete path, and the root path (M_ROOT_PATH) being replaced with an empty string (MIL_TEXT(\"\")). This value only applies to an images dataset context. M_DEFAULT Implements the default behavior. M_MAKE_FILE_PATHS_RELATIVE Makes the file path of every entry in a dataset context into a relative path. This is done by parsing the absolute file path (M_ENTRY_IMAGE_PATH_ABS, M_SEGMENTATION_PATH_ABS, M_ANOMALY_DETECTION_PATH_ABS, and M_REGION_MASK_PATH_ABS) of all entries to find a common root path. If a common root path is found, the file paths of all entries are modified to use relative paths, and the root path (M_ROOT_PATH) is set to the newly found common root path. In addition, if M_REGION_MASKS_FOLDER, M_SEGMENTATION_FOLDER, and M_ANOMALY_DETECTION_FOLDER are set, those folders' paths are also involved in the search for the common root path. Note, if MobjInquire() with M_OBJECT_FILE_FOLDER returns a non-empty string value, and the common path has a part that is the same as the object's file folder, MIL will substitute this value with \"///DATASET/\". If M_OBJECT_FILE_FOLDER returns an empty string, MIL uses the common root path that was found. For example, if the file paths of two dataset entries are A:\\work\\examples\\ProcessingRocks\\Classification\\Image1.mim and A:\\work\\examples\\ProcessingRocks\\Classification\\Image2.mim, MIL would establish the common path as A:\\work\\examples\\ProcessingRocks\\Classification. In this case, if M_OBJECT_FILE_FOLDER returns A:\\work\\examples\\ProcessingRocks\\Classification, MIL would set the root path (M_ROOT_PATH) to ///DATASET///. However, if M_OBJECT_FILE_FOLDER returns an empty string, MIL would set the root path to A:\\work\\examples\\ProcessingRocks\\Classification. This value only applies to an images dataset context. M_DEFAULT Implements the default behavior. M_NO_CLASS_DRAW_COLOR Sets the color used for pixels that are either not assigned to any region or that you would like to not be assigned to any region. The effect of this value can be seen in MclassDrawEntry() with M_GROUND_TRUTH_IMAGE + M_PSEUDO_COLOR where any unlabeled pixels will be given this color if M_NO_REGION_PIXEL_CLASS is set to M_NO_CLASS. The effect of this value can also be seen in MclassEntryAddRegion() with M_GROUND_TRUTH_IMAGE_COLOR where any pixels of this color in the input image buffer will not be added as a region. This value only applies to an images dataset context. M_DEFAULT Same as M_COLOR_NO_CLASS. M_RGB888( MIL_INT Red, MIL_INT Green, MIL_INT Blue ) Specifies the RGB value to use as the region's color. Parameters Red Specifies the red component, as a value between 0 and 255. Green Specifies the green component, as a value between 0 and 255. Blue Specifies the blue component, as a value between 0 and 255. M_COLOR_BLACK Specifies the color black. M_COLOR_BLUE Specifies the color blue. M_COLOR_BRIGHT_GRAY Specifies the color bright gray. M_COLOR_CYAN Specifies the color cyan. M_COLOR_DARK_BLUE Specifies the color dark blue. M_COLOR_DARK_CYAN Specifies the color dark cyan. M_COLOR_DARK_GREEN Specifies the color dark green. M_COLOR_DARK_MAGENTA Specifies the color dark magenta. M_COLOR_DARK_RED Specifies the color dark red. M_COLOR_DARK_YELLOW Specifies the color dark yellow. M_COLOR_GRAY Specifies the color gray. M_COLOR_GREEN Specifies the color green. M_COLOR_LIGHT_BLUE Specifies the color light blue. M_COLOR_LIGHT_GRAY Specifies the color light gray. M_COLOR_LIGHT_GREEN Specifies the color light green. M_COLOR_LIGHT_WHITE Specifies the color light white. M_COLOR_MAGENTA Specifies the color magenta. M_COLOR_NO_CLASS Specifies the color (16, 0, 0). M_COLOR_RED Specifies the color red. M_COLOR_WHITE Specifies the color white. M_COLOR_YELLOW Specifies the color yellow. M_NO_REGION_PIXEL_CLASS Sets the class of any pixels that are not associated with any regions and therefore do not have an assigned value for M_CLASS_INDEX_GROUND_TRUTH. This control lets you determine whether you want to interpret these region-less values as having no class or being a part of a specific class. This control can be useful for interpreting unlabeled pixels as part of a specific class. For example, if you have two classes, one being the object you are interested in and the other being the background class, you have the option of only labeling the objects that you are interested in and then setting the M_NO_REGION_PIXEL_CLASS to be the index of your background class. In this case, during training, all pixels without a region will be interpreted as having the same ground truth index as the background class. M_NO_REGION_PIXEL_CLASS is associated with the UUID of the class at the specified index at the time that it is set. If the corresponding class is later deleted, M_NO_REGION_PIXEL_CLASS will default to M_NO_CLASS. The effect of this value can be seen in MclassDrawEntry() with M_GROUND_TRUTH_IMAGE + M_PSEUDO_COLOR where any pixels that do not have a label will be given the M_CLASS_DRAW_COLOR of the ground truth index specified by value of M_NO_REGION_PIXEL_CLASS. To change the color of the pixels assigned to M_NO_CLASS, use the M_NO_CLASS_DRAW_COLOR control. M_DEFAULT Same as M_NO_CLASS. M_DONT_CARE_CLASS Specifies that all pixels not assigned to a region will not contribute to training loss. M_NO_CLASS Specifies that no class index is used for pixels not assigned to a region. 0 &lt;= Value &lt; M_NUMBER_OF_CLASSES Specifies the index of the class that is used for pixels not assigned to a region. M_REGION_MASKS_FOLDER Sets the path at which to save the region masks as they are added by MclassEntryAddRegion(). When working with relative paths, you must set the region masks folder to be under the root path. This value only applies to an images dataset context. MIL_TEXT(\"///DATASET///\") 1 Specifies the folder path from where the dataset context is restored, using MclassRestore(). If this path does not exist, MIL uses the path in which your application's executable file is located. Note, if using a C compiler, you must pass the value as M_PTR_TO_MIL_INT(MIL_TEXT(\"///DATASET///\")). MIL_TEXT(\"RegionMaskFilePath\") 1 Specifies the region mask file path. For example, you can specify the root path as, MIL_TEXT(\"E:\\\\Manual\\RegionMasks\\Good\"). Note, if using a C compiler, you must pass the value as M_PTR_TO_MIL_INT(MIL_TEXT(\"RegionMaskFilePath\")). M_ROOT_PATH Sets the root path that is used for the file path of a dataset's entry images, region masks, and segmentation scores. The file path is set, using MclassControlEntry() with M_ENTRY_IMAGE_PATH, M_REGION_MASK_PATH, M_SEGMENTATION_PATH, and M_ANOMALY_DETECTION_PATH. Note, this is also related to (affects) M_REGION_MASKS_FOLDER, M_SEGMENTATION_FOLDER, and M_ANOMALY_DETECTION_FOLDER. This value only applies to an images dataset context. MIL_TEXT(\"\") 1 Specifies an empty path. This indicates that all entries' file paths are absolute paths. Note, if using a C compiler, you must pass the value as M_PTR_TO_MIL_INT(MIL_TEXT(\"\")). MIL_TEXT(\"///DATASET///\") 1 Specifies the folder path from where the dataset context is restored, using MclassRestore(). If this path does not exist, MIL uses the path in which your application's executable file is located. Note, if using a C compiler, you must pass the value as M_PTR_TO_MIL_INT(MIL_TEXT(\"///DATASET///\")). MIL_TEXT(\"RootFilePath\") 1 Specifies the root file path. For example, you can specify the root path as, MIL_TEXT(\"E:\\\\Manual\\LabeledIt\\Good\"). Note, if using a C compiler, you must pass the value as M_PTR_TO_MIL_INT(MIL_TEXT(\"RootFilePath\")). M_SEGMENTATION_FOLDER Sets the path at which to save the segmentation scores. When working with relative paths, you must set the segmentation folder to be under the root path. This value only applies to an images dataset context. MIL_TEXT(\"///DATASET///\") 1 Specifies the folder path from where the dataset context is restored, using MclassRestore(). If this path does not exist, MIL uses the path in which your application's executable file is located. Note, if using a C compiler, you must pass the value as M_PTR_TO_MIL_INT(MIL_TEXT(\"///DATASET///\")). MIL_TEXT(\"SegmentationFilePath\") 1 Specifies the segmentation file path. For example, you can specify the root path as, MIL_TEXT(\"E:\\\\Manual\\Segmentation\\Good\"). Note, if using a C compiler, you must pass the value as M_PTR_TO_MIL_INT(MIL_TEXT(\"SegmentationFilePath\")). 1 If you are passing the value in a variable, don't enclose it in MIL_TEXT(). To control a classifier or dataset context, set the ControlType parameter to one of the values below. In this case, set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a classifier or dataset context, and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CONTEXT, unless otherwise specified. Note, these values apply to a classifier context or an images or a features dataset context, unless otherwise specified. For a classifier or dataset context ControlType Description ControlValue M_CLASS_ADD Adds a new class definition to a classifier or dataset context, with the specified name. MIL assigns an index to the new class definition such that the index is 1 greater than the highest existing class definition index. M_NULL Specifies to add a new class definition with no explicitly defined name. MIL defines a default name, in a \"Class ##\" format, where \"##\" is the index value. MIL_TEXT(\"NewClassName\") 1 Specifies the name of the class definition to add. Note, if using a C compiler, you must pass the value as M_PTR_TO_MIL_INT(MIL_TEXT(\"NewClassName\")). M_CLASS_DELETE Deletes a class definition from a classifier or dataset context, according to the specified index. If an entry in a dataset context references this deleted class definition, that reference is also deleted. Dataset entries without class definitions will cause an error when you call MclassTrain(). M_DEFAULT Same as M_ALL. M_CLASS_INDEX( MIL_INT ClassIndex ) Specifies a class definition to delete. If a region (other than region 0) refers to the specified class to delete, that region is removed. Parameters ClassIndex Set this parameter to the following: 0 &lt;= Value &lt;M_NUMBER_OF_CLASSES Specifies the index. You can inquire the total number of class definition indices, using M_NUMBER_OF_CLASSES. M_ALL Specifies to delete all class definitions. All regions other than region 0 will be removed. M_CLASS_DELETE_BY_KEY Deletes a class definition from a classifier or dataset context, according to the specified key (UUID). If an entry in a dataset context references this deleted class definition, that reference is also deleted. Dataset entries without class definitions will cause an error when you call MclassTrain(). MIL_UUID Value Specifies the key of the class definition to delete. The key is defined as a MIL universal unique identifier (UUID). To specify a MIL_UUID value when using a C compiler, you must call the MIL_UUID version of this function (MclassControlMilUuid). When using a C++ or other compiler, MclassControl() internally calls the MIL_UUID version of this function. If a region (other than region 0) is referred to the specified class, the region is removed. MIL_UUID version of MclassControl void MclassControlMilUuid (MIL_ID ContextOrResultClassId, MIL_INT64 LabelOrIndex, MIL_INT64 ControlType, MIL_UUID ControlValue) 1 If you are passing the value in a variable, don't enclose it in MIL_TEXT(). To control a class definition, the ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be set to the following values. Unless otherwise specified, set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a classifier context (predefined CNN, object detection, predefined segmentation, predefined anomaly detection, tree ensemble, or ONNX) or a dataset context (images or features), and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CLASS_INDEX(). Note, class definitions are added to a dataset context, using M_CLASS_ADD. For a class definition in a classifier or dataset context (for CNN, object detection, segmentation, anomaly detection, tree ensemble, or ONNX) ControlType Description ControlValue M_CLASS_DRAW_COLOR Sets the color assigned to a class definition. This color is used as a visual label and helps to identify class definitions. Draw operations use the class definition color. M_RGB888( MIL_INT Red, MIL_INT Green, MIL_INT Blue ) Specifies the RGB value to use as the region's color. Parameters Red Specifies the red component, as a value between 0 and 255. Green Specifies the green component, as a value between 0 and 255. Blue Specifies the blue component, as a value between 0 and 255. M_COLOR_BLACK Specifies the color black. M_COLOR_BLUE Specifies the color blue. M_COLOR_BRIGHT_GRAY Specifies the color bright gray. M_COLOR_CYAN Specifies the color cyan. M_COLOR_DARK_BLUE Specifies the color dark blue. M_COLOR_DARK_CYAN Specifies the color dark cyan. M_COLOR_DARK_GREEN Specifies the color dark green. M_COLOR_DARK_MAGENTA Specifies the color dark magenta. M_COLOR_DARK_RED Specifies the color dark red. M_COLOR_DARK_YELLOW Specifies the color dark yellow. M_COLOR_GRAY Specifies the color gray. M_COLOR_GREEN Specifies the color green. M_COLOR_LIGHT_BLUE Specifies the color light blue. M_COLOR_LIGHT_GRAY Specifies the color light gray. M_COLOR_LIGHT_GREEN Specifies the color light green. M_COLOR_LIGHT_WHITE Specifies the color light white. M_COLOR_MAGENTA Specifies the color magenta. M_COLOR_RED Specifies the color red. M_COLOR_WHITE Specifies the color white. M_COLOR_YELLOW Specifies the color yellow. M_CLASS_ICON_ID Sets the class definition's sample image. This image helps visually identify the class definition. This does not affect calculations. When you call MclassControl() with M_CLASS_ICON_ID, MIL copies the image to the context and assigns it a new identifier. MIL returns this new identifier, if you inquire M_CLASS_ICON_ID. M_NULL Specifies that the image associated with the class definition is freed. Note that if the specified class definition does not have an associated image, this setting has no effect. MIL image identifier Specifies the identifier of the image buffer to use for the class definition's sample image. M_CLASS_NAME Sets the name of a class definition that is currently in the dataset context. This name replaces the current class definition's name. MIL_TEXT(\"ClassDefinitionName\") 1 Specifies the name of a class definition. Note, if using a C compiler, you must pass the value as M_PTR_TO_MIL_INT(MIL_TEXT(\"ClassDefinitionName\")). M_CLASS_WEIGHT Sets the class definition's weight. In this case, you must set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a features dataset context, an images dataset context being used for segmentation, or a tree ensemble classifier context. The specified weight can only have an effect if M_CLASS_WEIGHT_MODE is set to M_USER_DEFINED. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the weight. 1 If you are passing the value in a variable, don't enclose it in MIL_TEXT(). To control the source layer of the classifier in an ONNX classifier context, the ControlType parameter can be set to one of the following values. In this case, set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_DEFAULT_SOURCE_LAYER. For a classifier context's source layer (ONNX) ControlType Description ControlValue M_BAND_ORDER Sets the order of the input bands of the network. This corresponds to the order in which the network interprets the bands of the images that were used in the training phase. If the bands in the target image (MclassPredict()) do not follow this order, MIL internally compensates by temporarily copying the bands to be ordered as the network expects. M_DEFAULT Same as M_RGB. M_BGR Specifies that the bands are ordered according to the BGR (Blue, Green, Red) convention. M_RGB Specifies that the bands are ordered according to the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) convention. To control a global setting of a data preparation context (for image data), the ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be set to one of the following values. In this case, set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a data preparation context, and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CONTEXT. These values affect the execution of MclassPrepareData(). Data preparation values related to augmentation (M_AUGMENT_...) only have an effect if augmentations are enabled. This can be done by calling MclassControl() and enabling preset augmentations (M_PRESET...). You can also enable other types of augmentation operations (M_AUG_..._OP) by calling MimControl() with the identifier of the data preparation context's internal augmentation context, which you can inquire using M_AUGMENT_CONTEXT_ID. For a data preparation context (images) ControlType Description ControlValue M_AUGMENT_BALANCING Sets a value that represents the proportion of augmented entries that will go towards class balancing. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 80.0. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the proportion of augmented entries that will go towards class balancing. For example, if this is set to 80.0, then 80 percent of the augmented entries specified by M_AUGMENT_NUMBER_ABSOLUTE will go towards balancing the dataset whereas the last 20 percent (mainly for image classification) will go evenly to all classes such that they can all have some augmentation. M_AUGMENT_BALANCING only applies when calling MclassPrepareData() with datasets. If you call MclassPrepareData() with image buffers, M_AUGMENT_BALANCING is ignored. M_AUGMENT_NUMBER_ABSOLUTE Sets the number of augmented entries that MIL should add to the destination dataset. M_AUGMENT_NUMBER_ABSOLUTE only applies when calling MclassPrepareData() with datasets. If you call MclassPrepareData() with image buffers, M_AUGMENT_NUMBER_ABSOLUTE is ignored. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the number of augmented entries that should be added to the destination dataset. If you do not specify any augmentations, either with M_PRESET_... or with the internal augmentation context (M_AUGMENT_CONTEXT_ID), no images are added to the destination dataset. The actual number of augmented entries added to the destination dataset will be less than the augment number if there are any problems with the images in the source dataset. To check that all images were augmented properly you can check the M_STATUS hook info in the M_PREPARE_ENTRY_POST hook. M_AUGMENT_NUMBER_FACTOR Sets the ratio with which to establish the number of augmentations to add to the destination dataset. M_AUGMENT_NUMBER_FACTOR only applies when calling MclassPrepareData() with datasets. If you call MclassPrepareData() with image buffers, M_AUGMENT_NUMBER_FACTOR is ignored. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 3.0. If you do not specify any augmentations, either with M_PRESET_... or with the internal augmentation context (M_AUGMENT_CONTEXT_ID), no images are added to the destination dataset. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the ratio. MIL applies the ratio value to the source dataset to establish the number of augmentations in the destination dataset. For example, setting M_AUGMENT_NUMBER_FACTOR to 3.0 indicates a 3:1 ratio between augmented images (destination dataset) and original images (source dataset). Specifying 0.0 results in no augmented entries being added. M_AUGMENT_NUMBER_MODE Sets the mode with which to establish the number of augmentations that should be added to the destination dataset when calling MclassPrepareData(). M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_ABSOLUTE Specifies that the number of augmentations is established with M_AUGMENT_NUMBER_ABSOLUTE. M_AUTO Specifies that MIL automatically establishes the number of augmentations. When augmenting a dataset, M_AUTO is the same as M_FACTOR. When augmenting an image buffer, M_AUTO is the same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that no augmentations are performed. This does not affect other data preparations (these are still performed). M_FACTOR Specifies that the number of augmentations is established with M_AUGMENT_NUMBER_FACTOR. M_CENTER_MODE Sets the mode with which to establish the center of the destination image. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_AUTO Specifies that the center of the destination image is taken to be the center of the source image. If a hook-handler function was called due to an M_PREPARE_ENTRY_PRE event, the user-defined centers will be over written by the centers specified by MclassSetHookInfo() with M_CENTER_X and M_CENTER_Y. M_USER_DEFINED Specifies the center for cropping is taken to be the user-defined M_CENTER_X and M_CENTER_Y. If a hook-handler function was called due to an M_PREPARE_ENTRY_PRE event, the user-defined centers will be over written by the centers specified by MclassSetHookInfo() with M_CENTER_X and M_CENTER_Y. This mode requires that the M_CENTER_X and M_CENTER_Y be selected such that in combination with the size the cropped image does not exceed the boundaries of the source image. M_CENTER_X Sets the X-coordinate of the center point used by M_CENTER_MODE. M_CENTER_X only has an effect if M_CENTER_MODE is set to M_USER_DEFINED. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the X-coordinate. M_CENTER_Y Sets the Y-coordinate of the center point used by M_CENTER_MODE. M_CENTER_Y only has an effect if M_CENTER_MODE is set to M_USER_DEFINED. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the Y-coordinate. M_DESTINATION_FOLDER_MODE Sets the mode MIL uses to manage the destination folder in which it saves the prepared images. M_DEFAULT Same as M_CREATE. M_CREATE Specifies that the data preparation process creates a unique prepare destination folder. Each time you call MclassPrepareData(), prepared images are written to this unique folder. Previously created folders are not overwritten. MIL creates the unique prepare folders under the folder specified with M_PREPARED_DATA_FOLDER; for example, M_PREPARED_DATA_FOLDER/prepare1, M_PREPARED_DATA_FOLDER/prepare2, M_PREPARED_DATA_FOLDER/prepare..., M_PREPARED_DATA_FOLDER/preparex. Note, MIL uses the first available folder by following this hierarchy. M_OVERWRITE Specifies that the data preparation process uses the same prepare destination folder. Each time you call MclassPrepareData(), prepared images are written to this folder. MIL creates the prepare folder under the folder specified with M_PREPARED_DATA_FOLDER; that is, M_PREPARED_DATA_FOLDER/prepare. When using overwrite mode, you cannot make concurrent calls to MclassPrepareData(). M_PREPARE_ORIGINAL_IMAGES Sets the mode with which to add source entries to the destination dataset, when cropping/resizing images with MclassPrepareData(). By default, no cropping or resizing is done; in this case, MclassPrepareData() adds (copies) the original (source) images as-is. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_AUTO Specifies that the source dataset entries, for cropped/resized images, are added to the destination dataset, if they were not previously added. In this case, multiple calls with the same destination dataset will result in the cropped/resized images only being present in the destination dataset once. M_DISABLE Specifies that the source dataset entries, for cropped/resized images, are not added to the destination dataset. M_ENABLE Specifies that the source entries, for cropped/resized images, are added to the destination dataset, regardless of whether they were previously added. This can result in repeated entries/images. M_PREPARED_DATA_FOLDER Sets the path to the destination folder in which to save the prepared dataset. MIL_TEXT(\"\") 1 Specifies an empty path. This implies the destination folder is the default destination folder (My Documents\\MIL\\MilClass\\PreparedData on Windows or MIL/MilClass/PreparedData in the user's home directory on Linux). Note, if using a C compiler, you must pass the value as M_PTR_TO_MIL_INT(MIL_TEXT(\"\")). MIL_TEXT(\"DestinationFolder\") 1 Specifies the destination folder where the prepared dataset will be saved. Note, if using a C compiler, you must pass the value as M_PTR_TO_MIL_INT(MIL_TEXT(\"DestinationFolder\")). M_PRESET_ASPECT_RATIO Sets whether to enable the aspect ratio augmentation operation. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to disable the aspect ratio augmentation operation. M_ENABLE Specifies to enable the aspect ratio augmentation operation with preset values.

M_DISABLE Specifies to disable the gamma augmentation operation. M_ENABLE Specifies to enable the gamma augmentation operation with preset values. M_PRESET_HUE_OFFSET Sets whether to enable the hue offset augmentation operation. This operation is not supported for binary (1-bit) and grayscale (1-band) images. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to disable the hue offset augmentation operation. M_ENABLE Specifies to enable the hue offset augmentation operation with preset values. M_PRESET_INTENSITY_ADD Sets whether to enable the intensity add augmentation operation. This operation is not supported for binary (1-bit) images. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to disable the intensity add augmentation operation. M_ENABLE Specifies to enable the intensity add augmentation operation with preset values. M_PRESET_INTENSITY_MULTIPLY Sets whether to enable the intensity multiply augmentation operation. This operation is not supported for binary (1-bit) images. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to disable the intensity multiply augmentation operation. M_ENABLE Specifies to enable the intensity multiply augmentation operation with preset values. M_PRESET_LIGHTING_DIRECTIONAL Sets whether to enable the directional lighting augmentation operation. Modifying an image's directional lighting can be seen as a type of add-ramp operation. This operation is not supported for binary (1-bit) images. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to disable the directional lighting augmentation operation. M_ENABLE Specifies to enable the directional lighting augmentation operation with preset values. M_PRESET_NOISE_GAUSSIAN_ADDITIVE Sets whether to enable the Gaussian additive noise augmentation operation. This operation is not supported for binary (1-bit) images. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE.

M_DISABLE Specifies to disable the salt and pepper noise augmentation operation. M_ENABLE Specifies to enable the salt and pepper noise augmentation operation with preset values. M_PRESET_REDUCE Sets whether to enable the reduce augmentation operation. The reduce operation creates an image with the mean values and puts the reduced image at a random location with the regions translated accordingly. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to disable the reduce augmentation operation. M_ENABLE Specifies to enable the reduce augmentation operation with preset values. M_PRESET_ROTATION Sets whether to enable the rotation augmentation operation. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to disable the rotation augmentation operation. M_ENABLE Specifies to enable the rotation augmentation operation with preset values. M_PRESET_SATURATION_GAIN Sets whether to enable the saturation gain augmentation operation. This operation is not supported for binary (1-bit) and grayscale (1-band) images. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to disable the saturation gain augmentation operation. M_ENABLE Specifies to enable the saturation gain augmentation operation with preset values. M_PRESET_SCALE Sets whether to enable the scale augmentation operation. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to disable the scale augmentation operation. M_ENABLE Specifies to enable the scale augmentation operation with preset values.

M_PRESET_TRANSLATION Sets whether to enable the translation augmentation operation. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to disable the translation augmentation operation. M_ENABLE Specifies to enable the translation augmentation operation with preset values. M_RESIZE_SCALE_FACTOR Sets the resize scale factor to apply between the contents of the source and destination images. While the control affects the contents of an image by cropping or adding black borders, it does not affect the size x/y of the destination image. Black borders will be ignored during training. For example, a resize scale factor of 0.5 will result in the contents of the destination images being half the size of the source images, with the remainder of the destination image filled with a black border. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. M_FILL_DESTINATION_BILINEAR Specifies to make all entries scale to fill the destination image size x/y determined by M_SIZE_MODE, M_SIZE_X, M_SIZE_Y and classifier passed in the MclassPrepareData() call using bilinear interpolation. This mode is meant for the case where you would like to resize all images to a common size x/y without cropping or adding black borders. When in this mode, M_CENTER_MODE, M_CENTER_X, and M_CENTER_Y are all ignored and not used even if they are set. M_FILL_DESTINATION_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR Specifies to make all entries scale to fill the destination image size x/y determined by M_SIZE_MODE, M_SIZE_X, M_SIZE_Y and classifier passed in the MclassPrepareData() call using nearest neighbor interpolation. This mode is meant for the case where you would like to resize all images to a common size x/y without cropping or adding black borders. When in this mode, M_CENTER_MODE, M_CENTER_X, and M_CENTER_Y are all ignored and not used even if they are set. 0.0 &lt; Value &lt;= 16.0 Specifies the factor by which to resize. If the factor is set to 1.0 (default), there is no resizing. M_SIZE_MODE Sets the mode with which to establish the size of the destination image. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_AUTO Specifies that the size of the destination image will be the same as the source image if no classifier was given. If a trained classifier is given, then the size of the destination image will be the same as the source layer. If an untrained classifier is given, then the size of the destination image will be the same as the source image size. Note, if you are using a legacy FCNet classifier, and it is untrained, it will try to adapt the source image size to the nearest classifier formula size. When selecting a size based on the classifier formula, the one selected will be the nearest one when rounding down. In this case, the size of the destination will always be less than or equal to the size of the source image and never larger. M_USER_DEFINED Specifies the size of the destination image will be the user-defined M_SIZE_X and M_SIZE_Y. Both M_SIZE_X and M_SIZE_Y must be specified in this mode. When M_SIZE_MODE is set to M_USER_DEFINED, the classifier (ClassifierContextClassId) in MclassPrepareData() must not be specified. M_SIZE_X Sets the width for the destination image. To use this control, M_SIZE_MODE must be set to M_USER_DEFINED and the classifier (ClassifierContextClassId) in MclassPrepareData() must not be specified. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the width. M_SIZE_Y Sets the height for the destination image. To use this control, M_SIZE_MODE must be set to M_USER_DEFINED and the classifier (ClassifierContextClassId) in MclassPrepareData() must not be specified. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the height. 1 If you are passing the value in a variable, don't enclose it in MIL_TEXT(). To control a global setting of a data preparation context (for image data) or a training context (anomaly detection or tree ensemble), the ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be set to one of the following values. Set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a data preparation context (for image data) or the identifier of a training context (anomaly detection or tree ensemble), and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CONTEXT. For a data preparation context (images) or a training context (anomaly detection or tree ensemble) ControlType Description ControlValue M_SEED_MODE Sets the mode with which to initialize the seed used for anomaly detection and tree ensemble training or image data augmentation. MIL uses the seed value to generate the random numbers needed to train an anomaly detection context or a tree ensemble. Specifically, MIL uses randomness to: Select the entries for each training set (if you do not disable M_BOOTSTRAP). Select the features to consider when splitting a node. To control the maximum number of features considered, use M_NODE_MAX_NUMBER_OF_FEATURES_MODE and M_NODE_MAX_NUMBER_OF_FEATURES. To shuffle the values of a feature for all entries of the development set (or out-of-bag set), when calculating the feature importance (M_FEATURE_IMPORTANCE_MODE) using permutation (M_PERMUTATION). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default mode with which to initialize the seed. Same as M_USER_DEFINED for training contexts. Same as M_AUTO for data preparation contexts. M_AUTO Specifies that the seed is chosen at random, and that MIL generates and uses a new seed each time you call MclassTrain(). To retrieve the used seed, call MclassGetResult() with M_GENERAL and M_SEED_VALUE. If you retrain with the same seed, you can reproduce the same training (MIL uses the same random values). M_USER_DEFINED Specifies the user-defined seed set with M_SEED_VALUE. M_SEED_VALUE Sets the seed value that MIL uses to generate random numbers. These random numbers are used to train a tree ensemble or to generate the random augmentations required by image data preparation. MIL ignores this explicitly specified seed value if M_SEED_MODE is set to M_AUTO. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the seed value. To control a global setting of a classifier context or a training context, the ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be set to one of the following values. In this case, set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a predefined CNN, predefined object detection, predefined segmentation, predefined anomaly detection, or tree ensemble training or classifier context, and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CONTEXT. For a classifier or training context (CNN, object detection, segmentation, anomaly detection, or tree ensemble) ControlType Description ControlValue M_PREDICT_ENGINE Sets the predict engine to use during MclassPredict(). You can get predict engine information by calling MclassInquire() with M_PREDICT_ENGINE_.... You must have installed the appropriate MIL X Service Pack add-on to perform GPU accelerated prediction using CUDA or OpenVINO. MIL add-ons are available for download through the Updates item found in the MILConfig utility. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default predict engine that was set using the MILConfig utility. 0 &lt;= Value &lt; M_NUMBER_OF_PREDICT_ENGINES Specifies the index of the predict engine to use. To inquire a description of the predict engine associated with an index, call MclassInquire() with M_PREDICT_ENGINE_DESCRIPTION. M_TIMEOUT Sets the maximum calculation time, in msec. If you specify a training context, the timeout applies to MclassTrain(). If you specify a classifier context, the timeout applies to MclassPredict(). M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies an infinite amount of time. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the maximum time, in msec. To control a global setting of a CNN, object detection, segmentation, or anomaly detection training context, the ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be set to one of the following values. In this case, set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a CNN, object detection, segmentation, or anomaly detection training context, and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CONTEXT. For a training context (CNN, object detection, segmentation, anomaly detection) ControlType Description ControlValue M_MINI_BATCH_SIZE Sets the size of each mini-batch. MIL uses mini-batches to split the training dataset to help make the training process more efficient. You can automatically modify this setting, if you modify M_RESET_TRAINING_VALUES. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value. For image classification (M_TRAIN_CNN), the default is 32. For segmentation (M_TRAIN_SEG) and object detection (M_TRAIN_DET), the default is 4. For anomaly detection (M_TRAIN_ANO), the default is 1. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the size. M_TRAIN_ENGINE Sets the engine (processing unit) that MIL uses to perform the training process. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_AUTO Specifies the engine automatically. Typically, MIL uses the best available GPU. M_CPU Specifies the CPU. M_GPU Specifies the GPU. You must have installed the appropriate MIL X Service Pack add-on to train on your GPU. MIL add-ons are available for download through the Updates item found in the MILConfig utility. To control a global setting of a CNN, object detection or segmentation training context, the ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be set to one of the following values. In this case, set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a CNN, object detection or segmentation training context, and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CONTEXT. For a training context (CNN, object detection or segmentation) ControlType Description ControlValue M_FOCAL_LOSS_GAMMA Sets a focusing value for the focal loss when training. This only has an effect when M_LOSS_FUNCTION_TYPE is set to M_FOCAL_LOSS. This is only available for classification and segmentation training contexts (M_TRAIN_CNN and M_TRAIN_SEG). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 2.0. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the focusing value. Greater values reduce the relative loss for well-classified images while putting more focus on hard to classify images. M_INITIAL_LEARNING_RATE Sets the initial learning rate for training. The learning rate determines the degree to which the classifier's weights are modified at each mini-batch during training. You can automatically modify this setting, if you modify M_RESET_TRAINING_VALUES. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value. For image classification (M_TRAIN_CNN), the default is 0.005. For segmentation (M_TRAIN_SEG) and object detection (M_TRAIN_DET), the default is 0.001. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the learning rate. M_LEARNING_RATE_DECAY Sets the learning rate decay for training. The learning rate decay determines how fast the learning rate decreases during training. This can help prevent excessive weights. You can automatically modify this setting, if you modify M_RESET_TRAINING_VALUES. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value. For image classification (M_TRAIN_CNN), the default is 0.1. For segmentation (M_TRAIN_SEG) and object detection (M_TRAIN_DET), the default is 0.05. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the learning rate decay. M_LOSS_FUNCTION_TYPE Sets the type of loss function for training. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_AUTO Specifies that MIL automatically establishes the type of loss function to use. For image classification, MIL uses M_CROSS_ENTROPY. For object detection, MIL uses M_DET_LOSS. For segmentation, MIL uses M_FOCAL_LOSS. M_CROSS_ENTROPY Specifies a cross entropy type of loss. This is only available for classification and segmentation training contexts (M_TRAIN_CNN and M_TRAIN_SEG). M_DET_LOSS Specifies a detection type of loss. This is only available for object detection training contexts (M_TRAIN_DET). M_DICE_LOSS Specifies a dice type of loss. This is only available for segmentation training contexts (M_TRAIN_SEG). M_FOCAL_LOSS Specifies a focal type of loss. To set a focusing value for the focal loss, use M_FOCAL_LOSS_GAMMA. This is only available for classification and segmentation training contexts (M_TRAIN_CNN and M_TRAIN_SEG). M_MAX_EPOCH Sets the maximum number of epochs. An epoch refers to one complete cycle through the data that the classifier must learn during training. You can automatically modify this setting, if you modify M_RESET_TRAINING_VALUES. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 60. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the maximum number. M_RESET_TRAINING_VALUES Sets the value of all training mode controls (hyperparameters) automatically, according to the specified training mode. Note, only M_COMPLETE is supported for object detection. M_DEFAULT Same as M_COMPLETE. M_COMPLETE Specifies a complete training mode. Typically, this is for completely restarting the training of a CNN, object detection or segmentation classifier context, or for training a CNN, object detection or segmentation classifier context that is not trained. The training mode controls, and what M_COMPLETE automatically sets them to, are listed below. Unless otherwise specified, values apply for image classification (M_TRAIN_CNN), object detection (M_TRAIN_DET), and segmentation (M_TRAIN_SEG). M_INITIAL_LEARNING_RATE 0.005 (image classification) or 0.001 (object detection and segmentation) M_LEARNING_RATE_DECAY 0.1 (image classification) or 0.05 (object detection and segmentation) M_MAX_EPOCH 60 M_MINI_BATCH_SIZE 32 (image classification) or 4 (object detection and segmentation) M_SCHEDULER_TYPE M_CYCLICAL_DECAY (image classification and segmentation) or M_FACTOR_DECAY (object detection) When using M_COMPLETE, the classifier architecture adapts to certain qualities of the training dataset (image X- and Y-size, image bands, and the number of classes). All of the classifier's weights (learnable parameters) are randomly initialized prior to a complete training. M_FINE_TUNING Specifies a fine tuning training mode. Typically, this is for a CNN or segmentation classifier context that was already trained on a specific classification problem, and that you must fine tune with new data. If you specify M_FINE_TUNING with a classifier context that was not sufficiently trained, you will get an error. The training mode controls, and what M_FINE_TUNING automatically sets them to, are listed below. Unless otherwise specified, values apply for image classification (M_TRAIN_CNN) and segmentation (M_TRAIN_SEG). M_INITIAL_LEARNING_RATE 0.001 M_LEARNING_RATE_DECAY 0.1 (image classification) or 0.05 (segmentation) M_MAX_EPOCH 60 M_MINI_BATCH_SIZE 32 (image classification) or 4 (segmentation) M_SCHEDULER_TYPE M_DECAY When using M_FINE_TUNING, the classifier architecture is unchangeable. Therefore, the classifier's weights must be complete, and all the related qualities of the training dataset (image X- and Y-size, image bands, and the number of classes) must comply to the classifier's architecture. A fine-tuning training starts by using the classifier's current weights (learnable parameters). M_FINE_TUNING is not supported for object detection. M_TRANSFER_LEARNING Specifies a transfer learning mode. Typically, this is for a CNN or segmentation classifier context that was already trained on a specific classification problem, and that you must train on a similar (but new) problem. If you specify M_TRANSFER_LEARNING with a context that was not sufficiently trained, you will get an error. The training mode controls, and what M_TRANSFER_LEARNING automatically sets them to, are listed below. Unless otherwise specified, values apply for image classification (M_TRAIN_CNN) and segmentation (M_TRAIN_SEG). M_INITIAL_LEARNING_RATE 0.005 (image classification) or 0.001 (segmentation) M_LEARNING_RATE_DECAY 0.1 (image classification) or 0.05 (segmentation) M_MAX_EPOCH 60 M_MINI_BATCH_SIZE 32 (image classification) or 4 (segmentation) M_SCHEDULER_TYPE M_CYCLICAL_DECAY When using M_TRANSFER_LEARNING, the classifier architecture adapts to certain qualities of the training dataset (image X- and Y-size, and the number of classes). During training, some of the classifier's weights (learnable parameters) are randomly initialized and affected by the training (those related to classifying features), while others remain unaffected by the training (those related to extracting features). M_TRANSFER_LEARNING is not supported for object detection. M_SCHEDULER_TYPE Sets the schedule with which to adjust the learning rate. You can automatically modify this setting, if you modify M_RESET_TRAINING_VALUES. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value. For image classification and segmentation, the default is M_CYCLICAL_DECAY. For object detection, the default is M_FACTOR_DECAY. M_CYCLICAL_DECAY Specifies to decay the learning rate at an internally established cyclical schedule. M_DECAY Specifies to decay the learning rate, as weights are updated. M_FACTOR_DECAY Specifies to decay the learning rate by a factor at every specified epoch. M_SPLIT_PERCENTAGE Sets the percentage value, for the training dataset, used by MclassTrain() when splitting a single dataset into a training and development dataset. For example, if you call MclassTrain() with a single dataset, and you set M_SPLIT_PERCENTAGE to 80 percent (M_DEFAULT), the training dataset will contain 80 percent of the entries in the single dataset, and the development dataset will contain 20 percent of the entries. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 80.0. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the percentage. M_SPLIT_SEED_MODE Sets the split seed mode to use when splitting a single dataset into a training and development dataset. For example, this can be set to randomly assign each entry to the training set or development set using M_RANDOM or, a fixed selection process using M_FIXED. M_DEFAULT Same as M_RANDOM. M_FIXED Specifies to use the M_SPLIT_CONTEXT_FIXED_SEED predefined split classification context, for image classification (CNN) or feature classification (tree ensemble), or the M_SPLIT_SEG_CONTEXT_FIXED_SEED predefined split classification context, for segmentation. M_RANDOM Specifies to use the M_SPLIT_CONTEXT_DEFAULT predefined split classification context, for image classification (CNN) or feature classification (tree ensemble), or the M_SPLIT_SEG_CONTEXT_DEFAULT predefined split classification context, for segmentation. M_TRAIN_DESTINATION_FOLDER Sets the path to the destination folder in which to save training results. For image classification training (M_TRAIN_CNN) and object detection training (M_TRAIN_DET), this specifies the location of the prepared images that will be stored on disk. For segmentation training (M_TRAIN_SEG), this determines the destination for both the segmentation scores and the prepared images that will be stored on disk. MIL_TEXT(\"\") 1 Specifies an empty path. This indicates that you are using the default path, which you can inquire using M_TRAIN_DESTINATION_FOLDER + M_DEFAULT_PATH. Note, if using a C compiler, you must pass the value as M_PTR_TO_MIL_INT(MIL_TEXT(\"\")). MIL_TEXT(\"TrainingResultsPath\") 1 Specifies the training results file path. For example, you can specify the root path as, MIL_TEXT(\"E:\\\\Manual\\TrainingResults\\Good\"). Note, if using a C compiler, you must pass the value as M_PTR_TO_MIL_INT(MIL_TEXT(\"TrainingResultsPath\")). 1 If you are passing the value in a variable, don't enclose it in MIL_TEXT(). To set a global setting of a CNN, segmentation, or tree ensemble training context, set the ControlType parameter to the value below. In this case, set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a CNN, segmentation, or tree ensemble training context, and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CONTEXT. For a training context (CNN, segmentation, or feature classification) ControlType Description ControlValue M_SUPPORT_MISSING_GROUND_TRUTH Sets whether the training process allows the training and development datasets to contain entries that do not have a ground truth. An entry's ground truth is specified using MclassControlEntry() with M_CLASS_INDEX_GROUND_TRUTH. For segmentation, when M_NO_REGION_PIXEL_CLASS is set to M_NO_CLASS, entries without a descriptor based region (M_DESCRIPTOR_BASED) are considered not to have a ground truth. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that entries without a ground truth are not allowed. In this case, if you call MclassTrain(), and one or more entries in the training or development datasets do not have a ground truth, you will get an error. M_ENABLE Specifies that entries without a ground truth are allowed. In this case, if you call MclassTrain(), and one or more entries in the training or development datasets do not have a ground truth, MIL ignores them. To control a global setting of a segmentation training context, the ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be set to one of the following values. In this case, set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a segmentation training context, and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CONTEXT. For a training context (segmentation) ControlType Description ControlValue M_CLASS_WEIGHT_STRENGTH Sets the class weight strength when training with an inverse class frequency weight mode (M_INVERSE_CLASS_FREQUENCY). This setting has no effect when training with other weight modes. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 50.0. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the proportion of weighting to assign to M_INVERSE_CLASS_FREQUENCY. Reducing this value reduces the emphasis on the less represented classes. M_FEATURE_SIZE_X Sets the width (X-size) of the smallest feature to segment. This acts as a lower bound to the X-size of the class regions that the classifier expects during training. This control might be useful if the minimum feature size is larger than the minimum receptive field of the classifier. The default feature size (M_MIN) is typically the best possible setting. This has no effect when fine tuning (M_FINE_TUNING). If images have been resized during data preparation (either by MclassPrepareData() or an internal data preparation context), this value must be set relative to the final prepared images. M_DEFAULT Same as M_MIN. M_MIN Specifies the smallest size possible. Value &gt; 0 Specifies that the classifier will adjust to encompass features of the size you set, provided they are larger than the minimum possible feature size. M_FEATURE_SIZE_Y Sets the height (Y-size) of the smallest feature to segment. This acts as a lower bound to the Y-size of the class regions that the classifier expects during training. This control might be useful if the minimum feature size is larger than the minimum receptive field of the classifier. The default feature size (M_MIN) is typically the best possible setting. This has no effect when fine tuning (M_FINE_TUNING). If images have been resized during data preparation (either by MclassPrepareData() or an internal data preparation context), this value must be set relative to the final prepared images. M_DEFAULT Same as M_SAME. M_MIN Specifies the smallest size possible. M_SAME Specifies to use the same value as M_FEATURE_SIZE_X. Value &gt; 0 Specifies that the classifier will adjust to encompass features of the size you set, provided they are larger than the minimum possible feature size. M_SAVE_SCORES_AT_EPOCH Sets whether to save segmentation scores on disk at the end of each epoch. You must save segmentation scores to copy them from a segmentation training result buffer (MclassCopyResult() with M_DEV_DATASET_PREDICT_SCORES or M_TRAIN_DATASET_PREDICT_SCORES). Note, the scores of the current epoch overwrite the scores of the previous epoch. The scores that you then copy are the ones from the last epoch. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies not to save segmentation scores on disk at the end of each epoch. M_ENABLE Specifies to save segmentation scores on disk at the end of each epoch. M_USE_MASK_DESCRIPTORS Sets whether to use mask descriptors for training. You must enable M_USE_MASK_DESCRIPTORS if you disable M_USE_POLYGON_DESCRIPTORS (both can be enabled, but both cannot be disabled). M_DEFAULT Same as M_ENABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies not to use mask descriptors for training. M_ENABLE Specifies to use mask descriptors for training. M_USE_POLYGON_DESCRIPTORS Sets whether to use polygon descriptors for training. You must enable M_USE_POLYGON_DESCRIPTORS if you disable M_USE_MASK_DESCRIPTORS (both can be enabled, but both cannot be disabled). M_DEFAULT Same as M_ENABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies not to use polygon descriptors for training. M_ENABLE Specifies to use polygon descriptors for training. To control a global setting of an anomaly detection training context, the ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be set to one of the following values. In this case, set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of an anomaly detection training context, and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CONTEXT. For a training context (anomaly detection) ControlType Description ControlValue M_MINI_BATCHES_PER_SAMPLING Sets how many mini-batches are loaded into memory before sampling when M_TRAIN_MODE is set to M_ITERATIVE_SAMPLING. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the number of mini-batches. M_SAMPLES_FIXED_SIZE Sets the number of patches to determine the sample size. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 4000. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the number of patches. M_TRAIN_MODE Sets the mode in which the samples are selected. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_AUTO Specifies to automatically select the mode in which the samples are selected. This is the same as M_GLOBAL_SAMPLING. M_GLOBAL_SAMPLING Specifies a global selection mode. M_ITERATIVE_SAMPLING Specifies an iterative selection mode. To control a global setting of a segmentation or tree ensemble training context, the ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be set to one of the following values. In this case, set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a segmentation or tree ensemble training context, unless otherwise specified, and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CONTEXT. For a training context (segmentation or tree ensemble) ControlType Description ControlValue M_CLASS_WEIGHT_MODE Sets how to establish the weight of a class definition. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_AUTO Specifies that MIL automatically sets how the weight is established. For segmentation training contexts, if the loss function type is M_FOCAL_LOSS or M_CROSS_ENTROPY, M_AUTO is the same as M_INVERSE_CLASS_FREQUENCY. If the loss function type is M_DICE_LOSS, M_AUTO is the same as M_SQUARED_INVERSE_CLASS_FREQUENCY. For image classification and tree ensemble training contexts, M_AUTO is the same as M_NONE. M_BALANCE Specifies a balanced weight. This setting is only for tree ensemble. M_INVERSE_CLASS_FREQUENCY Specifies to use weight factors equal to the inverse of each class frequency. You can further adjust the weight factors with M_CLASS_WEIGHT_STRENGTH. This setting is only for segmentation. M_NONE Specifies no weight. M_SQUARED_INVERSE_CLASS_FREQUENCY Specifies to use weight factors equal to the squared inverse of each class frequency. You can further adjust the weight factors with M_CLASS_WEIGHT_STRENGTH. This setting is only for segmentation. M_USER_DEFINED Specifies to use the weight defined with M_CLASS_WEIGHT. To control a global setting of a tree ensemble training context, the ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be set to one of the following values. In this case, set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a tree ensemble training context, and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CONTEXT. For a training context (tree ensemble) ControlType Description ControlValue M_BOOTSTRAP Sets whether to use bootstrap aggregation for the training dataset entries to produce multiple and separate training sets when building trees. M_DEFAULT Same as M_WITH_REPLACEMENT. M_DISABLE Specifies not to use bootstrap aggregation. M_WITH_REPLACEMENT Specifies to use bootstrap aggregation, and allow replacement (chosen entries in a training set can be chosen again). M_WITHOUT_REPLACEMENT Specifies to use bootstrap aggregation, and not allow replacement (chosen entries in a training set cannot be chosen again). M_COMPUTE_OUT_OF_BAG_RESULTS Sets whether to use out-of-bag dataset entries to estimate the generalization accuracy during training. Note, bagging information is typically unreliable if your training dataset has augmented entries. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ENABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies not to use out-of-bag entries. M_ENABLE Specifies to use out-of-bag entries. M_COMPUTE_PROXIMITY_MATRIX Sets whether to calculate the proximity measure matrix when building trees. This is a normalized N x N matrix, where N is the number of entries. The intersection value between pairs of entries in the matrix defines their proximity, which refers to the average number of trees that occupy the same terminal node for those entries. For example, if entries i and j are in the same terminal node, their proximity increases. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies not to calculate the proximity measure matrix when building trees. M_ENABLE Specifies to calculate the proximity measure matrix when building trees. M_FEATURE_IMPORTANCE_MODE Sets how to establish the importance of the features. Every entry in a features dataset refers to a set of features. For example, every entry can refer to a set of blob features, such as area, perimeter, and Feret diameter. Specific values for these features are specified, for each entry, using MclassControlEntry() with M_RAW_DATA. By enabling a feature importance mode, MIL establishes, during training, whether certain features are more important than others in determining the class to which the input data belongs. For example, the perimeter feature can end up being very important to establishing a successful classification, while the area feature can end up being almost irrelevant. To retrieve the resulting importance of features after training, call MclassGetResult() with M_FEATURE_IMPORTANCE. You can then modify your set of features and retrain, which can help improve the tree ensemble classifier's performance and accuracy. Note, M_FEATURE_IMPORTANCE_MODE does not directly affect training. It allows you to retrieve which features are more important; you can then use this information to modify your dataset (for example, you can specify only the important features) and retrain. In general, the fastest modes with which to establish the feature importance are M_MEAN_DECREASE_IMPURITY, M_PERMUTATION, and M_DROP_COLUMN, while the modes with which to most accurately establish the feature importance are M_DROP_COLUMN, M_PERMUTATION, and M_MEAN_DECREASE_IMPURITY. M_DEFAULT Same as M_MEAN_DECREASE_IMPURITY. M_DISABLE Specifies to disable the feature importance mode. In this case, you cannot retrieve any information about the feature importance. M_DROP_COLUMN Specifies that the feature importance is based on the drop column of features. In this case, the more the elimination of a feature affects accuracy, the more importance that feature is given. To specify the set with which to calculate this type of feature importance, use M_FEATURE_IMPORTANCE_SET. To use M_DROP_COLUMN, you must train with a development dataset or compute out-of-bag results (that is, enable M_COMPUTE_OUT_OF_BAG_RESULTS). M_MEAN_DECREASE_IMPURITY Specifies that the feature importance is based on a decreasing impurity process. In this case, the more a feature affects a proper node splitting, the more important it is. Proper splitting means that the two sets resulting from splitting the node are significantly purer (better) than the set that was input to the node. M_PERMUTATION Specifies that the feature importance is based on feature permutation. In this case, the more the shuffling of a feature affects accuracy, the more importance that feature is given. To specify the set with which to calculate this type of feature importance, use M_FEATURE_IMPORTANCE_SET. To use M_PERMUTATION, you must train with a development dataset or compute out-of-bag results (that is, enable M_COMPUTE_OUT_OF_BAG_RESULTS). M_FEATURE_IMPORTANCE_SET Sets how to establish the group of features with which to determine feature importance when using drop column or permutation. M_FEATURE_IMPORTANCE_SET only has an effect if M_FEATURE_IMPORTANCE_MODE is set to M_DROP_COLUMN or M_PERMUTATION. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_AUTO Specifies to automatically establish the feature set to use. If available, MIL uses M_DEV_DATASET; otherwise, MIL uses M_OUT_OF_BAG. M_DEV_DATASET Specifies to use the development dataset. M_OUT_OF_BAG Specifies to use the out-of-bag set. In this case, you must not disable M_BOOTSTRAP. Note, bagging information is typically unreliable if your data is augmented. M_MIN_IMPURITY_DECREASE Sets a decrease of impurity requirement for splitting a node. That is, MIL will split a node if it induces a decrease of impurity greater than or equal to the specified value. The weighted impurity decrease equation is as follows: N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity), where N is the total number of dataset entries, N_t is the number of dataset entries related to the current node, N_t_L is the number of dataset entries related to the left child, and N_t_R is the number of dataset entries related to the right child. N, N_t, N_t_R, and N_t_L all refer to the weighted sum, if weights (entry weights and class weights) are used. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the impurity value. M_MIN_NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES_LEAF Sets the minimum number of training dataset entries, or a percentage of the minimum number of related dataset entries, that MIL uses to identify a leaf node. MIL uses this value to establish M_MIN_NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES_LEAF_MODE. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1. 0.0 &lt; MinNumPercent &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the minimum number of entries, as a percentage. You should only use a percentage when M_MIN_NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES_LEAF_MODE is set to M_USER_DEFINED_PERCENTAGE. If you specify a percentage value that results in the minimum number of entries equaling 0, MIL uses 1 as the minimum number; that is, if Round((Value/100) * NumberEntriesInTrainDataset) == 0, then MinNumberEntriesLeaf = 1. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the minimum number of entries. You should only use this value when M_MIN_NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES_LEAF_MODE is set to M_USER_DEFINED_VALUE. M_MIN_NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES_LEAF_MODE Sets how to establish the minimum number of related dataset entries required to be at a leaf node. A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at least the minimum number of entries (leaf training entries) in each of the left and right branches. M_DEFAULT Same as M_USER_DEFINED_VALUE. M_USER_DEFINED_PERCENTAGE Specifies to use a percentage, determined from the minimum number of entries defined with M_MIN_NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES_LEAF. M_USER_DEFINED_VALUE Specifies to use the minimum number of entries defined with M_MIN_NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES_LEAF. M_MIN_NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES_SPLIT Sets the minimum number of training dataset entries, or a percentage of the minimum number of related dataset entries, that MIL uses to determine how to best split the internal nodes of the trees. MIL uses this value to establish M_MIN_NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES_SPLIT_MODE. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 2. 0.0 &lt; MinNumPercent &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the minimum number of entries, as a percentage. This only has an effect if M_MIN_NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES_SPLIT_MODE is set to M_USER_DEFINED_PERCENTAGE. If you specify a percentage value that results in the minimum number of entries equaling 0, MIL uses 2 as the minimum number; that is, if Round((Value/100) * NumberEntriesInTrainDataset) == 0, then MinNumberEntriesSplit = 2. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the minimum number of entries. This only has an effect if M_MIN_NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES_SPLIT_MODE is set to M_USER_DEFINED_VALUE. M_MIN_NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES_SPLIT_MODE Sets how to establish the minimum number of related dataset entries required to split an internal node. M_DEFAULT Same as M_USER_DEFINED_VALUE. M_USER_DEFINED_PERCENTAGE Specifies to use a percentage, determined from the minimum number of entries defined with M_MIN_NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES_SPLIT. M_USER_DEFINED_VALUE Specifies to use the minimum number of entries defined with M_MIN_NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES_SPLIT. M_MIN_WEIGHT_FRACTION_LEAF Sets the minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all the dataset entries) required to be at a leaf node. Entries have equal weight when M_CLASS_WEIGHT_MODE is set to M_NONE. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 0.5 Specifies the minimum weighted fraction. M_NODE_MAX_NUMBER_OF_FEATURES Sets the maximum number of features in the training dataset, or a percentage of the maximum number of features, that MIL can use to determine how to best split the nodes of the trees. M_NODE_MAX_NUMBER_OF_FEATURES only has an effect if M_NODE_MAX_NUMBER_OF_FEATURES_MODE is set to M_USER_DEFINED_VALUE or M_USER_DEFINED_PERCENTAGE. If M_NODE_MAX_NUMBER_OF_FEATURES_MODE is set to M_LOG2, and the number of features in the dataset is 1, MIL trains with 1 feature, even though the calculation results in 0; that is, log(1) = 0. If M_NODE_MAX_NUMBER_OF_FEATURES_MODE is equal to M_USER_DEFINED_VALUE, and M_NODE_MAX_NUMBER_OF_FEATURES is higher than the actual number of features in the training dataset, MIL uses all the features in the dataset. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ALL. M_ALL Specifies no maximum. 0.0 &lt;= MaxNumPercent &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the percentage with which to determine the maximum number of features. This only has an effect if M_NODE_MAX_NUMBER_OF_FEATURES_MODE is set to M_USER_DEFINED_PERCENTAGE. If you specify a percentage value that results in the maximum number of features equaling 0, MIL uses 1 feature as the maximum number; that is, if Round((Value/100)*NumberOfFeaturesInTrainDataset) == 0, then MaxNumberOfFeatures = 1 (see M_NODE_MAX_NUMBER_OF_FEATURES_MODE). Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the value with which to determine the maximum number of features. This only has an effect if M_NODE_MAX_NUMBER_OF_FEATURES_MODE is set to M_USER_DEFINED_VALUE. If you specify a maximum value that is greater than the total number of features available, MIL uses the total number of features available. M_NODE_MAX_NUMBER_OF_FEATURES_MODE Sets how to establish the maximum number of features that MIL uses to determine how to best split the nodes of the trees. M_DEFAULT Same as M_SQUARE_ROOT. M_ALL Specifies that all available features are used. M_LOG2 Specifies to use a base 2 logarithm, determined from the total number of features. This can be described as: M_LOG2 = Round(Log2(NumberOfFeatures)). M_SQUARE_ROOT Specifies to use a square root, determined from the total number of features. This can be described as: M_SQUARE_ROOT = Round(Log2(NumberOfFeatures)). M_USER_DEFINED_PERCENTAGE Specifies to use a percentage, determined from the total number of features, where the percentage is set by M_NODE_MAX_NUMBER_OF_FEATURES. This can be described as: M_USER_DEFINED_PERCENTAGE = Round(NumberOfFeatures* MaxNumberOfFeatures/100). M_USER_DEFINED_VALUE Specifies to use the maximum number of features defined with M_NODE_MAX_NUMBER_OF_FEATURES. M_NUMBER_OF_TREES Sets the number of trees in the tree ensemble train context. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 10. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the amount of trees in the tree ensemble. M_SPLIT_QUALITY_TYPE Sets how to measure the quality of a node split. M_DEFAULT Same as M_GINI. M_ENTROPY Specifies that MIL uses an Entropy based function to measure the quality of a node split. M_GINI Specifies that MIL uses a Gini based function to measure the quality of a node split. M_TREE_MAX_DEPTH Sets the maximum depth of the trees in the tree ensemble. The depth of a tree (M_TREE_MAX_DEPTH) is the depth of its deepest node. The depth of a node is the number of edges (connectors) from that node to the tree's root node. A root node has a depth of 0. To retrieve the actual depth achieved after training, call MclassGetResult() with M_TREE_DEPTHS_ACHIEVED. The depth achieved is always less than or equal to the maximum tree depth (M_TREE_MAX_DEPTH). M_DEFAULT Same as M_NONE. M_NONE Specifies no maximum depth. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the maximum depth. M_TREE_MAX_NUMBER_OF_LEAF_NODES Sets the maximum number of terminal nodes in the tree. M_DEFAULT Same as M_NONE. M_NONE Specifies no maximum. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the maximum number of terminal nodes in the tree. To control a general setting of a training result buffer, the ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be set to one of the following values. In this case, set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a CNN, object detection, segmentation, or tree ensemble training result buffer, unless otherwise specified, and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_GENERAL. For a training result buffer (CNN, object detection, segmentation, or tree ensemble) ControlType Description ControlValue M_STOP_TRAIN Stops the current execution of MclassTrain(). This can only be done from another thread of higher priority, or from a user-defined classification hook function. If you stop training a CNN, object detection or segmentation classifier context, and 1 or more epochs are completed, results are typically available, except those related to development accuracy, training accuracy, development error rate, and training error rate. If you stop training a tree ensemble classifier context, and 1 or more trees are completed, all results are available. If 1 or more epochs are completed, MIL saves the trained classifier results that MclassTrain() produces up to the point that you stop training. You can copy these results into a classifier context, using MclassCopyResult(). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default behavior. M_UPDATE_TRAINED_PARAMS Updates the internal and hidden parameters (weights) of the classifier. This only applies when training a CNN or segmentation classifier, which you must specify with the ContextOrResultClassId parameter. M_DEFAULT Same as M_NOW. M_NOW Specifies to immediately update the training parameters network. To control a general setting of a prediction result buffer, the ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be set to one of the following values. Unless otherwise specified, set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a CNN, object detection, segmentation, tree ensemble, or ONNX prediction result buffer, and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_GENERAL. Note, it is possible to specify M_STOP_PREDICT when calling MclassPredict() with a target dataset; this requires setting the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of the output dataset (images or features), and setting the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CONTEXT. For a prediction result buffer (CNN, object detection, segmentation, tree ensemble, or ONNX) or a dataset (images or features) ControlType Description ControlValue M_STOP_PREDICT Stops the current execution of MclassPredict(). This can only be done from another thread of higher priority, or from a user-defined classification hook function. If you stop the prediction, MIL does not return any results. Note, to stop the prediction of a target dataset, you must set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of the output dataset (produced by MclassPredict()), and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CONTEXT. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default behavior. To control a general setting of a prediction result buffer, the ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be set to one of the following values. Unless otherwise specified, set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of an object detection prediction result buffer, and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_GENERAL. For a prediction result buffer (object detection) ControlType Description ControlValue M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS Sets which units and coordinate system to use for prediction results. This setting only affects positional results within the MIL Classification module. Note, this setting can be changed at any time to get results in the required units. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ACCORDING_TO_CALIBRATION. M_ACCORDING_TO_CALIBRATION Specifies to use world units if the target image is associated with a camera calibration context; otherwise, specifies to use pixel units. M_PIXEL Specifies to use pixel units with respect to the pixel coordinate system. M_WORLD Specifies to use world units with respect to the relative coordinate system. Using MclassGetResult() will generate an error if the target image is not associated with a calibration context. To control a general setting of a prediction or training result buffer, the ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be set to one of the following values. Unless otherwise specified, set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a CNN, object detection, segmentation, or tree ensemble prediction or training result buffer, or an ONNX prediction result buffer, and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_GENERAL. For a prediction or training result buffer (CNN, object detection, segmentation, tree ensemble, or ONNX) ControlType Description ControlValue M_RESET Removes all results from the classification result buffer. Note that this does not delete the result buffer identifier, as is the case with MclassFree(). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default behavior. To control statistics classification, the ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be set to one of the following values. Note that some additional controls can also apply, such as M_TIMEOUT. For statistics classification ControlType Description ControlValue M_MATCH_IOU_THRESHOLD Sets the IOU threshold for an object detection stat context, based on which predicted boxes are compared to their matched ground truth boxes. By comparing the IOU of each matched pair, the boxes are classified on the confusion matrix. To use this control, you must set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a statistics classification context for object detection (M_STAT_DET) and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CONTEXT. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 50.0. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the IOU threshold. M_MODE Sets whether to calculate statistics for anomaly detection on an image level (default) or a pixel level. On an image level, the problem is an image classification one, whereas on the pixel level it is a segmentation problem. To use this control, you must set the ContextOrResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a statistics classification context for anomaly detection (M_STAT_ANO) and set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_CONTEXT. M_DEFAULT Same as M_IMAGE_LEVEL. M_IMAGE_LEVEL Specifies to calculate statistics for anomaly detection on an image level. This takes into account M_WHOLE_IMAGE regions to identify anomalous entries. For a given entry, if its M_WHOLE_IMAGE region has no M_CLASS_INDEX_GROUND_TRUTH, it is considered non anomalous unless there exist at least one anomalous M_DESCRIPTOR_BASED region. M_PIXEL_LEVEL Specifies to calculate statistics for anomaly detection on a pixel level. This only takes into account M_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_POLYGON and M_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MASK regions of the entry to identify anomalous pixels. M_SCORE_THRESHOLD_STEP Sets the step increment of threshold values from 0.0 to 100.0. Last threshold might be less than 100.0 if the step setting leads past it.

M_DONT_CARE_CLASS Specifies that pixels assigned to the region do not contribute to the training loss, when using descriptor based regions (that is, any region index other than 0). To inquire if you are using descriptor based regions (MclassInquireEntry()), M_REGION_TYPE must return M_DESCRIPTOR_BASED. This don't care class (M_DONT_CARE_CLASS) is always available as a class definition that you can assign as the ground truth to a descriptor based region (that is, you do not need to add a don't care class definition). Typically, regions assigned to the don't care class will be areas of the image where the class of the object is unknown. As well, these regions can be assigned to the border pixels between two classes where labeling the edge between them can be difficult. You can set the color of the don't care regions with the M_DONT_CARE_CLASS_DRAW_COLOR control.

For example, you can copy the trained classifier result to a classifier context. The result buffer and classifier or dataset context must be compatible (that is, they must be for the same type of classifier). You can only copy trained results after calling MclassTrain(). Once you copy the trained results into a classifier context, you can continue to train that context (MclassTrain()) or you can predict with it (MclassPredict()). Parameters Parameters SrcResultClassId Specifies the identifier of the source training result buffer from which to copy. The result buffer must have been allocated using MclassAllocResult().

If copying segmentation results, MIL might modify the root path (M_ROOT_PATH), if one is specified, to maintain the dataset's coherence. For example, dataset paths should all be either relative or absolute. Copies are only performed if the corresponding entry already exists in the destination dataset (otherwise, nothing is copied). To copy segmentation score results, you must save them to disk during training; that is, the M_SAVE_SCORES_AT_EPOCH control (MclassControl()) must be set to M_ENABLE. M_TRAINED_CLASSIFIER Copies the trained classifier context established by MclassTrain(). To perform this copy operation, you must set the SrcResultClassId parameter to the identifier of a training result buffer, and the DstContextClassId parameter to the identifier of a classifier context. This is available for CNN, object detection, segmentation, anomaly detection, and tree ensemble classifiers; both the SrcResultClassId and the DstContextClassId parameter must contain the same type of classifier. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; milclass.lib. DLL Requires mil.dll; milclass.dll.

Syntax void MclassDraw( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextGraId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextOrResultClassId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufOrListGraId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Operation, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Index, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function draws specific features of a classifier context, a dataset context, or a prediction result buffer. Drawing operations are typically performed in a destination image buffer. You cannot draw from a tree ensemble result buffer, and you cannot perform any drawing operations with ONNX. By default, this function performs the drawing operation for every class in the specified context or result. To draw for a specific class or specific instance of a class, specify its index (Index). Parameters Parameters ContextGraId Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics context to use when drawing. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For specifying the 2D graphics context Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the default 2D graphics context of the current MIL application is used. Note that there is a different default 2D graphics context for each thread. MIL 2D graphics context identifier Specifies a valid 2D graphics context identifier, which you have allocated using MgraAlloc(). ContextOrResultClassId Specifies the identifier of the classifier or dataset context, or prediction result buffer from which to draw. For specifying the classifier or dataset context, or prediction result buffer Value Description ContextClassifierPredefinedId Specifies the identifier of the predefined CNN, object detection, segmentation, or anomaly detection classifier context. This context is allocated using MclassAlloc() with M_CLASSIFIER_CNN_PREDEFINED, M_CLASSIFIER_DET_PREDEFINED, M_CLASSIFIER_SEG_PREDEFINED, or M_CLASSIFIER_ANO_PREDEFINED. ContextClassifierTreeEnsembleId Specifies the identifier of a tree ensemble classifier context. This context is allocated using MclassAlloc() with M_CLASSIFIER_TREE_ENSEMBLE. ContextDatasetId Specifies the identifier of an images or features dataset context. These contexts must have been previously allocated on the required system using MclassAlloc() with M_DATASET_IMAGES or M_DATASET_FEATURES. ResultClassPredictId Specifies the identifier of the CNN, object detection, segmentation, or anomaly detections, prediction result buffer. This buffer is allocated using MclassAllocResult() with M_PREDICT_CNN_RESULT, M_PREDICT_DET_RESULT M_PREDICT_SEG_RESULT, or M_PREDICT_ANO_RESULT. DstImageBufOrListGraId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer or LUT buffer in which to draw. You should typically specify an image, which can be any valid MIL image buffer allocated using MbufAlloc...(). By drawing into a display's overlay buffer, you can also annotate an image non-destructively. To specify a LUT, you must use the M_DRAW_CLASS_COLOR_LUT drawing operation. When drawing from a CNN or segmentation prediction result buffer, the expected size of the destination image buffer is, by default, the same as the target image. This assumes prediction results are from a typical image classification process. When drawing from an object detection prediction result buffer, the destination image buffer in which to draw should either be the same image used in the prediction, or a graphics list. Note, the classification map (the output of the network) for a segmentation prediction result is, by default, scaled by M_RECEPTIVE_FIELD_STRIDE_X and M_RECEPTIVE_FIELD_STRIDE_Y, and placed at M_RECEPTIVE_FIELD_OFFSET_X and M_RECEPTIVE_FIELD_OFFSET_Y (these scale and map values are retrievable using MclassGetResult()). If you add M_REPLICATE_BORDER to the drawing operation, MIL expands (copies) the edges of the classification map to reach the edges of the destination buffer. You can modify the default scale and offset map behavior by adding M_NETWORK_OUTPUT_SIZE to the drawing operation. This performs the drawing operation according to the exact classification map (output of the network) without scaling or expanding. In this case, the destination buffer size should be equal to the resulting X- and Y-size of the classification map; to retrieve these dimensions, call MclassGetResult() with M_PREDICTION_SIZE_X and M_PREDICTION_SIZE_Y. Operation Specifies the drawing operation to perform. The following Operation parameter values can be set for a predefined classifier context (CNN, segmentation, or object detection), a tree ensemble classifier context, or a dataset context (images or features). For a predefined (CNN, segmentation, or object detection) or tree ensemble classifier context, or a dataset context (images or features) Value Description M_DRAW_CLASS_COLOR_LUT Draws the color (LUT) associated to the class. This color is defined using MclassControl() with M_CLASS_DRAW_COLOR. When performing this operation, you must set the destination buffer (DstImageBufOrListGraId) to the identifier of a MIL LUT buffer. To inquire the width of this LUT, use M_NUMBER_OF_CLASSES. M_DRAW_CLASS_ICON Draws the icon image associated to the class. This image is defined using MclassControl() with M_CLASS_ICON_ID. When performing this operation, you must set the destination buffer (DstImageBufOrListGraId) to the identifier of a MIL image buffer. To inquire the format of this buffer (DstImageBufOrListGraId), such as the X- and Y-size, use M_CLASS_ICON_ID (the dimension of the destination image in which you draw should be the same as the class description's icon image). The following Operation parameter values can be set for a CNN or segmentation prediction result buffer. These operations require an image buffer as the destination in which to draw (DstImageBufOrListGraId). For a CNN or segmentation prediction result buffer Value Description M_DRAW_BEST_INDEX_CONTOUR_IMAGE Draws the contours of the best classes. If you do not specify the M_PSEUDO_COLOR combination value, MIL uses the result type M_BEST_INDEX_IMAGE_TYPE to determine the type of the image to use. If you specify M_PSEUDO_COLOR, the image type must be 3 bands, 8-bit unsigned. Note, this drawing operation supports combination values from the For modifying the drawing operation table. The combination values that you can specify depend on the type of prediction result buffer that you are using: For CNN prediction results, you can specify M_NETWORK_OUTPUT_SIZE, M_PSEUDO_COLOR, and M_REPLICATE_BORDER. For segmentation prediction results, you can specify M_PSEUDO_COLOR. M_DRAW_BEST_INDEX_IMAGE Draws an image using the index value of the best class at each point. If you do not specify the M_PSEUDO_COLOR combination value, MIL uses the result type M_BEST_INDEX_IMAGE_TYPE to determine the type of the image to use. If you specify M_PSEUDO_COLOR, the image type must be 3 bands, 8-bit unsigned. Note, this drawing operation supports combination values from the For modifying the drawing operation table. The combination values that you can specify depend on the type of prediction result buffer that you are using: For CNN prediction results, you can specify M_NETWORK_OUTPUT_SIZE, M_PSEUDO_COLOR, and M_REPLICATE_BORDER.

If you do not specify the M_PSEUDO_COLOR combination value, the image type must be float or unsigned. If you specify M_PSEUDO_COLOR, the image type must be 3 bands, 8-bit unsigned. Note, this drawing operation supports combination values from the For modifying the drawing operation table. The combination values that you can specify depend on the type of prediction result buffer that you are using: For CNN prediction results, you can specify M_NETWORK_OUTPUT_SIZE, M_PSEUDO_COLOR, and M_REPLICATE_BORDER. For segmentation prediction results, you can specify M_PSEUDO_COLOR. M_DRAW_CLASS_SCORES Draws (fills) an image using the scores of a specific class. This drawing operation is not possible when drawing general results; you must set the Index parameter to a specific class. Note, this drawing operation supports combination values from the For modifying the drawing operation table. The combination values that you can specify depend on the type of prediction result buffer that you are using: For CNN prediction results, you can specify M_NETWORK_OUTPUT_SIZE and M_REPLICATE_BORDER. If you specify M_NETWORK_OUTPUT_SIZE, the drawing is done with the classification map size (the ControlFlag parameter must be set to its default). If you do not specify the M_NETWORK_OUTPUT_SIZE combination value, you can set the ControlFlag parameter to M_BILINEAR_INTERPOLATION or M_RECEPTIVE_FIELD_PATCH. In all cases, when using M_NETWORK_OUTPUT_SIZE, the image type must be float or 8-bit unsigned. For segmentation prediction results, you cannot specify any combination value. You cannot specify M_PSEUDO_COLOR for any predefined classifier. The following Operation parameter values can be set for an object detection prediction result buffer. For these operations, the destination in which to draw (DstImageBufOrListGraId) should be either the same image used in the prediction, or a graphics list. Multiple drawing operations for object detection can be used together by adding them. For example, M_DRAW_BOX + M_DRAW_BOX_NAME. This is only available for values in this table. For an object detection prediction result buffer Value Description M_DRAW_BOX Draws the bounding boxes for all instances, a specific class, or a specific instance (only one box will be drawn in this case). The drawn color is specified in the class definitions. To change the line thickness of the box, you can use MgraControl() with M_LINE_THICKNESS on the ContextGraId.

If used with M_DRAW_BOX, the class name is drawn on top of the outline of the bounding box. If used with M_DRAW_BOX_CENTER, the class name is drawn near the center of the bounding box. Text alignment controls set with MgraControl() are relative to these locations. M_DRAW_BOX_SCORE Draws the class scores for bounding boxes for all instances, a specific class, or a specific instance (only one score will be drawn in this case).

For these operations, the destination in which to draw (DstImageBufOrListGraId) should be either the same image used in the prediction, or a graphics list. For an anomaly detection prediction result buffer Value Description M_DRAW_ANOMALY_CONTOUR_MASK Draws the contour of the anomalies using the color of the graphics context specified by the ContextGraId parameter. To change the color, you can use MgraControl() with M_COLOR on the graphics context specified by the ContextGraId parameter. To change the line thickness of the contour lines, you can use MgraControl() with M_LINE_THICKNESS on the ContextGraId. Note, DstImageBufOrListGraId must be an image buffer of type M_UNSIGNED. Additionally, if the graphics context specified by the ContextGraId parameter is not grayscale, DstImageBufOrListGraId must be 3 bands and 8-bit. M_DRAW_ANOMALY_HEATMAP Draws the anomaly scores projected as a heat map for each pixel location in the image. Note, DstImageBufOrListGraId must be a 3-band image buffer of type M_UNSIGNED.

You cannot use M_NETWORK_OUTPUT_SIZE with M_REPLICATE_BORDER. M_PSEUDO_COLOR Draws using the pseudo colors defined by calling MclassControl() with M_CLASS_DRAW_COLOR. For all drawing operations, if you specify M_PSEUDO_COLOR, the destination buffer (DstImageBufOrListGraId) image type must be 3 bands, 8-bit unsigned. Depending on the draw operation, you can use M_PSEUDO_COLOR with other combination values. M_REPLICATE_BORDER Draws with borders expanded to the size of the destination buffer (DstImageBufOrListGraId). You cannot use M_REPLICATE_BORDER with M_NETWORK_OUTPUT_SIZE.

M_REPLICATE_BORDER Draws with borders expanded to the size of the destination buffer (DstImageBufOrListGraId). You cannot use M_REPLICATE_BORDER with M_NETWORK_OUTPUT_SIZE. You cannot use M_REPLICATE_BORDER with M_CSNET_... predefined classifiers. Combination value for M_GROUND_TRUTH_IMAGE , M_PSEUDO_COLOR. You can add the following value to the above-mentioned values to specify a modification to the drawing operation. For modifying the ground truth Combination value Description M_NO_REGION_PIXELS Specifies that unlabeled pixels are assigned values according to M_NO_REGION_PIXEL_CLASS. If M_NO_REGION_PIXEL_CLASS is set to M_NO_CLASS, pixels are set to -2. For an 8 + M_UNSIGNED buffer, that resolves to 0xFE (that is, 254). Otherwise if M_NO_REGION_PIXEL_CLASS is set to an index, the pixel will be given the same value of this index. Combined with M_PSEUDO_COLOR, this draws all the mask regions using the color specified in class definitions. If M_NO_REGION_PIXEL_CLASS is set to M_NO_CLASS, pixels are set to the color specified by M_NO_CLASS_DRAW_COLOR. This draws an image analogous to MclassEntryAddRegion() with M_GROUND_TRUTH_IMAGE_COLOR, but draws unlabeled pixels. EntryIndex Specifies the index of the entry to draw. When you specify an index with EntryIndex, you must set the EntryKey parameter to M_DEFAULT_KEY. Note that both EntryIndex and EntryKey cannot be set to M_DEFAULT and M_DEFAULT_KEY simultaneously. For specifying the index of an entry Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the index of an entry is not required. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the index of an entry. EntryKey Specifies the key (MIL_UUID) of the entry to which regions are added. The key is defined as a MIL universal unique identifier (UUID). When you specify an entry key with EntryKey, you must set the EntryIndex parameter to M_DEFAULT. Note that both EntryIndex and EntryKey cannot be set to M_DEFAULT and M_DEFAULT_KEY simultaneously. For specifying the unique key of an entry Value Description M_DEFAULT_KEY Specifies that the unique key of an entry is not required. Value Specifies the unique key of an entry. TaskType Specifies the task (image classification, segmentation, object detection, or anomaly detection) for which the drawing operation is performed. A dataset entry might contain results from more than one task. For specifying the type of task for which to draw results Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_ANOMALY_DETECTION Specifies that you are drawing for anomaly detection. M_AUTO Specifies the task for which to get results automatically, given the content in the dataset used (DatasetContextClassId). If the dataset selected is an images dataset, and it contains only image classification results, M_AUTO is the same as M_CLASSIFICATION. If the dataset contains only segmentation results, M_AUTO is the same as M_SEGMENTATION. If the dataset only contains object detection results, M_AUTO is the same as M_OBJECT_DETECTION. If the dataset only contains anomaly detection results, M_AUTO is the same as M_ANOMALY_DETECTION. If the dataset contains two types of results, then M_AUTO is the same as M_SEGMENTATION (if segmentation results are present), or M_CLASSIFICATION (if no segmentation results are present). If the dataset contains image classification, segmentation, and object detection results, M_AUTO is the same as M_SEGMENTATION. If the dataset contains segmentation and anomaly detection results, M_AUTO is the same as M_SEGMENTATION. If the dataset selected is a features dataset, M_AUTO is the same as M_CLASSIFICATION, since segmentation and object detection are not supported for a features dataset. To determine whether M_CLASSIFICATION, M_SEGMENTATION, M_OBJECT_DETECTION, or M_ANOMALY_DETECTION results are available in the dataset, use the M_PREDICT_INFO result. Typically, a dataset should be set up for a specific task (either image classification, segmentation, object detection, or anomaly detection). M_CLASSIFICATION Specifies that you are drawing for image classification. M_OBJECT_DETECTION Specifies that you are drawing for object detection. M_SEGMENTATION Specifies that you are drawing for segmentation. Index Specifies what to use to perform the drawing operation. Set this parameter to one of the following values. For specifying what to use to perform the drawing operation Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the function call refers to the entry and not to a specific region or instance. The draw operation will be applied in a sequential manner to all regions or instances associated with the image. Note, this is not available when Operation is set to M_DRAW_CLASS_SCORES. M_CLASS_INDEX( MIL_INT Index ) Specifies that the drawing operation is for a specific class in the specified dataset context (DatasetContextClassId). Note, this is not available when Operation is set to M_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_BOX, M_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MASK, M_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_POLYGON, or M_GROUND_TRUTH_IMAGE. Parameters Index Set this parameter to the following: Value Specifies the index of the class for which to draw. M_INSTANCE_INDEX( MIL_INT Index ) Specifies that the drawing operation is for a specific instance in the specified dataset context (DatasetContextClassId). This value only applies to an images dataset context. Note, this is only available when Operation is set to M_DRAW_BOX, M_DRAW_BOX_CENTER, M_DRAW_BOX_NAME, or M_DRAW_BOX_SCORE. Parameters Index Set this parameter to the following: Value Specifies the index of the instance for which to draw. M_REGION_INDEX( MIL_INT RegionIdx ) Specifies the function call refers to a specific region within the entry. This value only applies to an images dataset context. Note, this is only available when Operation is set to M_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_BOX, M_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MASK, or M_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_POLYGON. Parameters RegionIdx Set this parameter to the following: 0 &lt; Value &lt; M_NUMBER_OF_REGIONS Specifies a specific region within the entry. Note that there is always at least one region in an entry. DstLabelArrayPtr Specifies the address of the array in which to write the labels that have been automatically given to the copied or moved graphics in the destination graphics list. Set this parameter to M_NULL if the destination (DstImageBufOrListGraId) is an image buffer. To retrieve the size that this array must have, use MclassInquire() with M_NUMBER_OF_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_POLYGON. ControlFlag Specifies how to control the drawing operation. For all drawing operations except M_DRAW_CLASS_SCORES, set this parameter to M_DEFAULT. If entries were predicted by M_ICNET_... or legacy M_FCNET_... predefined classifiers, other values can be used. Typically, these drawing operations apply to prediction results from segmentation. For specifying how to control the class score drawing Value Description M_DEFAULT Implements the default behavior. This is the only possible setting for all drawing operations except M_DRAW_CLASS_SCORES. M_BILINEAR_INTERPOLATION Scales the classification map with a bilinear calculation. The scale is a network property and established in receptive field calculations. The scaled image is placed at the offset of the receptive field. This value is only supported for the M_DRAW_CLASS_SCORES drawing operation. M_RECEPTIVE_FIELD_PATCH Fills the corresponding receptive fields with calculated scores. Scores are drawn in order, from low to high. The best score is therefore drawn over lower scores. This value is only supported for the M_DRAW_CLASS_SCORES drawing operation.

Syntax void MclassEntryAddRegion( MIL_ID&nbsp;DatasetContextClassId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;EntryIndex, //in MIL_UUID&nbsp;EntryKey, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;DescriptorType, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DescriptorId, //in MIL_CONST_TEXT_PTR&nbsp;DescriptorFileName, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ClassIndexGroundTruth, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function adds regions to an entry in an images dataset context used for object detection or segmentation. This function should not be used for image or feature classification. Each time you call MclassEntryAddRegion(), one or more regions are added to the specified entry. The number and type of regions that are added is determined by the region's descriptor (DescriptorType). For example, you can add one or more regions from a mask (image) or a graphics list. Each added region has a ground truth assigned to it. Depending on the descriptor, the added region's ground truth is established with the ClassIndexGroundTruth or DescriptorId parameter. The pixels in the entry image that correspond to the added region are identified with this ground truth. The first region added has an index value of 1. Region 0 is created by default for all entries and is reserved for image classification. The ground truth of the entry itself applies to region 0, and has no effect on the added regions. To control and inquire about regions, call MclassControlEntry() and MclassInquireEntry(). To draw region information, call MclassDrawEntry(). Some internal descriptor information about regions, such as their polygon, can be drawn but not inquired. Parameters Parameters DatasetContextClassId Specifies the identifier of the images dataset context containing the entries for which to add the regions. This dataset context should be used for object detection or segmentation and must have been previously allocated on the required system using MclassAlloc() with M_DATASET_IMAGES. EntryIndex Specifies the index of the entry to which regions are added. When specifying an index with the EntryIndex parameter, you must set the EntryKey parameter to M_DEFAULT_KEY. You cannot set the EntryIndex parameter to M_DEFAULT and the EntryKey parameter to M_DEFAULT_KEY simultaneously. For specifying the entry's index Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the EntryIndex parameter is not required. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the index of an entry. EntryKey Specifies the key (MIL_UUID) of the entry to which regions are added. The key is defined as a MIL universal unique identifier (UUID). When specifying a key with the EntryKey parameter, you must set the EntryIndex parameter to M_DEFAULT. You cannot set the EntryKey parameter to M_DEFAULT_KEY and the EntryIndex parameter to M_DEFAULT simultaneously. For specifying the entry's key Value Description M_DEFAULT_KEY Specifies that the EntryKey parameter is not required. MIL_UUID Value Specifies the key (MIL_UUID) of an entry. DescriptorType Specifies the descriptor type of the region to add to the entry. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. DescriptorId Specifies the identifier of the MIL object that describes the region to add. If this parameter is not needed, set it to M_NULL. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. DescriptorFileName Specifies the file that describes the region to add. If this parameter is not needed, set it to M_NULL. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ClassIndexGroundTruth Specifies the index of the class definition that represents the added regions' ground truth. If this parameter is not needed, set it to M_DEFAULT. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion. This parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. Parameter associations The table below lists possible values for the DescriptorType, DescriptorId, DescriptorFileName, and ClassIndexGroundTruth parameters. For establishing the region to add to the entry For establishing the region to add to the entry DescriptorType Description DescriptorId DescriptorFileName ClassIndexGroundTruth M_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_BOX Adds a new bounding box region to the specified entry. The pixels in the entry image that correspond to the areas within the bounding box are considered part of the ground truth established for this region (ClassIndexGroundTruth). The bounding box must not be rotated by any angle. M_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_BOX is only available for object detection. MIL 2D graphics list identifier Sets the identifier of the 2D graphics list from which to establish the added region. The 2D graphics list must contain a single rectangle that is not defined in world units. DescriptorFileName This parameter is not needed and must be set to M_NULL. ClassIndexGroundTruth Sets the index of the class definition that represents the added region's ground truth. M_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MASK Adds an image (mask) region to the specified entry. The pixels in the entry image that correspond to the non-zero pixels (masked) in the specified image are considered part of the ground truth specified for this region (ClassIndexGroundTruth). You must use a single band image, and its dimensions must be the same as the entry image, as specified by M_ENTRY_IMAGE_PATH (MclassControlEntry()). This image must not have an ROI associated with it (MbufSetRegion()). M_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MASK is only available for segmentation. M_NULL Specifies that this parameter is not needed and the added region will be established from an image file (DescriptorFileName). DescriptorFileName Sets the image file from which to establish the added region. You must specify a valid file and path. The location of this file is specified by M_REGION_MASK_PATH (MclassControl()). You can specify relative paths; therefore, if the root path is set with M_ROOT_PATH (MclassControl()), then the following must represent a valid path: RootPath\\DescriptorFileName. ClassIndexGroundTruth Sets the index of the class definition that represents the added region's ground truth. MIL image buffer identifier Sets the identifier of the image buffer from which to establish the added region. This image will be saved on disk at the location specified by M_REGION_MASKS_FOLDER (MclassControl()). DescriptorFileName This parameter is not needed and must be set to M_NULL. The added region is established with an image buffer (DescriptorId). ClassIndexGroundTruth Sets the index of the class definition that represents the added region's ground truth. M_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_POLYGON Adds a region with one or more polygons to the specified entry. The pixels in the entry image that correspond to the areas within the polygons are considered part of the ground truth established for this region (ClassIndexGroundTruth). M_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_POLYGON is only available for segmentation. MIL 2D graphics list identifier Sets the identifier of the 2D graphics list from which to establish the added region. The 2D graphics list must contain polygons that are not defined in world units. DescriptorFileName This parameter is not needed and must be set to M_NULL. ClassIndexGroundTruth Sets the index of the class definition that represents the added region's ground truth. M_GROUND_TRUTH_IMAGE Adds regions to the entry according to the ground truth indices in the specified image. The pixel values in this image must represent class definition index values. The corresponding pixels in the entry image have that class definition as their ground truth. The number of regions added corresponds to the number of class definitions in the ground truth image. M_GROUND_TRUTH_IMAGE is similar to M_GROUND_TRUTH_IMAGE_COLOR, except you are providing the index of the class definitions, instead of their color. If you are adding many regions, using M_GROUND_TRUTH_IMAGE can be more efficient than adding the regions one by one. For each class definition (region) detected, an image (mask) is saved to disk at the location specified by M_REGION_MASKS_FOLDER (MclassControl()). If the specified ground truth image has an index value that does not correspond to an existing class definition index, MIL creates a class definition with that index, and all the missing class definitions (indices) up to it. This is the same behavior as MclassImport(). An index (pixel value) of -1 in the specified ground truth image indicates a don't care value. Pixels in the entry image that correspond to the -1 pixels in the ground truth image do not contribute to the training loss, but are available to be assigned to a region. This has the same effect as setting M_CLASS_INDEX_GROUND_TRUTH to M_DONT_CARE_CLASS (MclassControlEntry()). An index (pixel value) of -2 in the specified ground truth image indicates an unlabeled value. Pixels in the entry image that correspond to the -2 pixels in the ground truth image are not part of any region. Be cautious of how don't care pixels (-1) and unlabeled pixels (-2) get resolved, given the data type and depth of your images. For example, when using 8-bit unsigned images, unlabeled pixels (-2) resolve to 0xFE (that is, 254); if your dataset already holds 254 or more class definitions, a MIL error is generated, requesting an image buffer with a greater depth (for example, 16- bit unsigned). MIL image buffer identifier Sets the identifier of the image buffer from which to establish the added regions. This image buffer must not have an ROI associated with it (MbufSetRegion()). DescriptorFileName This parameter is not needed and must be set to M_NULL. ClassIndexGroundTruth This parameter is not needed and must be set to M_DEFAULT. The ground truth is established from the image buffer (DescriptorId). M_GROUND_TRUTH_IMAGE_COLOR Adds regions to the entry according to the ground truth colors in the specified image. The pixel values in this image must represent class definition colors. The corresponding pixels in the entry image have that class definition as their ground truth. The number of regions added corresponds to the number of class definition colors in the ground truth image. M_GROUND_TRUTH_IMAGE_COLOR is similar to M_GROUND_TRUTH_IMAGE, except you are providing the color of the class definitions, instead of their index. For each class definition (region) detected, an image (mask) is saved to disk at the location specified by M_REGION_MASKS_FOLDER (MclassControl()). If the specified ground truth image has a color that does not correspond to an existing class definition color, MIL creates a class definition with that color. Class definition colors are set with M_CLASS_DRAW_COLOR (MclassControl()). A color (pixel value) of M_DONT_CARE_CLASS_DRAW_COLOR (MclassControl()) in the specified ground truth image indicates a don't care value. Pixels in the entry image that correspond to M_DONT_CARE_CLASS_DRAW_COLOR in the ground truth image do not contribute to the training loss, but are available to be assigned to a region. A color (pixel value) of M_NO_CLASS_DRAW_COLOR (MclassControl()) in the specified ground truth image indicates an unlabeled value. Pixels in the entry image that correspond to M_NO_CLASS_DRAW_COLOR in the ground truth image are not part of any region. When using M_GROUND_TRUTH_IMAGE_COLOR, the M_CLASS_DRAW_COLOR, M_DONT_CARE_CLASS_DRAW_COLOR, and M_NO_CLASS_DRAW_COLOR controls must have unique colors. MIL image buffer identifier Sets the identifier of the image buffer from which to establish the added regions. This image buffer must not have an ROI associated with it (MbufSetRegion()). DescriptorFileName This parameter is not needed and must be set to M_NULL. ClassIndexGroundTruth This parameter is not needed and must be set to M_DEFAULT. The ground truth is established from the specified image buffer (DescriptorId). Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; milclass.lib. DLL Requires mil.dll; milclass.dll.

A dataset can be exported to a CSV file. Image datasets can also be exported to multiple files in a MIL folder structure. Training results are exported to TXT files. Tree ensemble classifiers (trees) are exported to DOT files. You would typically use this function to export an entire images dataset, using M_IMAGE_DATASET_FOLDER and M_COMPLETE. The following is an example of the resulting MIL folder structure after such an export. The folder names represent what MIL uses; the file names are fabricated. Datasets for image classification do not have descriptor, segmentation, or detection data; exporting such datasets would not result in those folders and files.

To import data, use MclassImport(). Parameters Parameters FileNameOrFolderPath Specifies the name and path of the file in which to export, or specifies the path to the folder in which to export multiple files in a MIL folder structure. The function handles (internally) the opening and closing of the file. If you specify a file that already exists, it will be overwritten. The specified file name must use the CSV, DOT, or TXT file extension. CSV and DOT files represent common formats that hold comma separated values and tree graph descriptions, respectively. You should use a CSV file when exporting from a dataset context. When exporting a tree ensemble classifier from a tree ensemble training result buffer or a tree ensemble classifier context, use a DOT file. A TXT file extension must be used when exporting training results from a CNN, object detection, segmentation, anomaly detection, or tree ensemble training result buffer. Set this parameter to one of the following values. For specifying the file name and path Value Description M_INTERACTIVE [This is only applicable to Windows] Opens a dialog box from which to interactively specify the file's drive, directory, and name. MIL_TEXT(\"FileName\") 1 Specifies the file's drive, directory, and name (for example, \"E:\\Manual\\MySweetSweetDataset.csv\"). To specify a file on a remote computer (under Distributed MIL), prefix the file name string with \"remote:///\" (for example, \"remote:///E:\\Manual\\MyEvenSweeterDataset.dot\"). 1 If you are passing the value in a variable, don't enclose it in MIL_TEXT(). FileOrFolderFormat Specifies the format of the file or folder in which to export. Set this parameter to one of the following values. For specifying the file format Value Description M_FORMAT_CSV Specifies a CSV file format. This value is supported when exporting from a dataset context. M_FORMAT_DOT Specifies a DOT file format. This value is supported when exporting a tree from a tree ensemble training result buffer or a tree ensemble classifier context. M_FORMAT_TXT Specifies a TXT file format. This value is supported when exporting from a CNN, segmentation, or tree ensemble training result buffer. M_IMAGE_DATASET_FOLDER Specifies a path to a folder in which to create the MIL folder structure for an images dataset. Note, the export does not complete if two classes (or more) have the same name, or if the creation of the folders would exceed MAX_PATH. M_IMAGE_DATASET_FOLDER_ALLOW_RENAME Specifies a path to a folder in which to create the MIL folder structure for an images dataset (allows the renaming of classes to make sure the export completes). Note, M_IMAGE_DATASET_FOLDER_ALLOW_RENAME, ignores the restrictions on M_IMAGE_DATASET_FOLDER to make sure that the exports completes. It does so by renaming duplicate and reserved class names, and shortening the names of the folders that are too long. Using this operation might cause MclassImport() to incorrectly import the dataset. ClassId Specifies the identifier of the MIL Classification module object from which to export. Set this parameter to one of the following values. For specifying the MIL Classification module object from which to export Value Description ContextDatasetId Specifies the identifier of a features or images dataset context. This context is allocated using MclassAlloc() with M_DATASET_FEATURES or M_DATASET_IMAGES. ContextTreeEnsembleClassiferId Specifies the identifier of a tree ensemble classifier context. This context is allocated using MclassAlloc() with M_CLASSIFIER_TREE_ENSEMBLE. ResultBufTrainId Specifies the identifier of a CNN, object detection, segmentation, or tree ensemble training result buffer. This buffer is allocated using MclassAllocResult() with M_TRAIN_CNN_RESULT, M_TRAIN_DET_RESULT, M_TRAIN_SEG_RESULT, or M_TRAIN_TREE_ENSEMBLE_RESULT. Index Specifies the tree to export from a tree ensemble training result buffer or tree ensemble classifier context. To export a tree, you must set the ExportType parameter to M_TRAIN_TREE. If you are not exporting a tree, you must set the Index parameter to M_DEFAULT. For specifying the index of the tree to export Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that you are not exporting a tree. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the index of the tree to export to a DOT file. ExportType Specifies the type of export operation to perform. Available operations depend on the context or result buffer from which you are exporting. If you are exporting from a dataset context, you can set the ExportType parameter to one of the following values. In this case, the FileNameOrFolderPath parameter must be set to either a CSV file or a folder path, the FileOrFolderFormat parameter must be set accordingly based on FileNameOrFolderPath parameter, the ClassId parameter must be set to the identifier of a dataset context, and the Index parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. For specifying what to export from a dataset context Value Description M_AUTHORS Specifies to export the authors to a CSV file. M_CLASS_DEFINITIONS Specifies to export the class definitions to a CSV file. M_COMPLETE Specifies to export all the information of the dataset; this includes: entries (images and CSV), segmentation files (MIL buffers), prediction results (CSV), descriptors (images and CSV), icons (images), class definitions (CSV), controls (CSV), and authors (CSV). This is typically the most useful setting for image datasets. To use it, the FileOrFolderFormat parameter must be set to M_IMAGE_DATASET_FOLDER or M_IMAGE_DATASET_FOLDER_ALLOW_RENAME. You cannot specify M_COMPLETE with DMIL. M_ENTRIES Specifies to export the entries to a CSV file. If you are exporting from a CNN, object detection, segmentation, or tree ensemble training result buffer, you can set the ExportType parameter to the following values. When exporting from a CNN, object detection or segmentation training result buffer, the FileNameOrFolderPath parameter must be set to a CSV file, the FileOrFolderFormat parameter must be set to M_FORMAT_CSV, the ClassId parameter must be set to the identifier of a CNN, object detection, or segmentation training result buffer, and the Index parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. When exporting from a tree ensemble training result buffer, the FileNameOrFolderPath parameter must be set to either a DOT or TXT file. The FileOrFolderFormat parameter must be set accordingly based on FileNameOrFolderPath parameter. To export tree(s), use M_FORMAT_DOT with M_TRAIN_TREE. To export a training report, use M_FORMAT_TXT with M_TRAIN_REPORT. For specifying what to export from a training result buffer Value Description M_TRAIN_REPORT Specifies to export a train report to a TXT file. If you are exporting from a CNN, object detection or segmentation training result buffer, the TXT file contains the CNN, object detection or segmentation training results of each epoch. If you are exporting from a tree ensemble training result buffer, the TXT file contains results from the training. For example, the TXT file contains results such as feature importance, train accuracy, and number of trained trees. To export a tree from a tree ensemble training result buffer or a tree ensemble classifier context, use the following value. For specifying what to export from a tree ensemble training result buffer or classifier context Value Description M_TRAIN_TREE Specifies to export the resulting tree to a DOT file.

Syntax void MclassGetResultEntry( MIL_ID&nbsp;DatasetContextClassId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;EntryIndex, //in MIL_UUID&nbsp;EntryKey, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;TaskType, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;LabelOrIndex, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ResultType, //in void&nbsp;*ResultArrayPtr //out ) Description This function retrieves results of the specified type from an entry in an images or a features dataset context. Before retrieving results from a dataset, you must call MclassTrain() or MclassPredict() with it. If you want to get results from a dataset after calling MclassTrain(), you must copy the dataset-specific results from the result buffer that MclassTrain() produces to a dataset (MclassCopyResult()) before calling MclassGetResultEntry(). This copy is not required for MclassPredict(), since it can write results directly in the dataset. Parameters Parameters DatasetContextClassId Specifies the identifier of the images or features dataset context from which to get results. This context is allocated using MclassAlloc() with M_DATASET_IMAGES or M_DATASET_FEATURES and you must have called MclassTrain() and copied the results using MclassCopyResult() or have called MclassPredict() with it. EntryIndex Specifies the index of the entry for which to get results. When specifying an index with the EntryIndex parameter, you must set the EntryKey parameter to M_DEFAULT_KEY. You cannot set the EntryIndex parameter to M_DEFAULT and the EntryKey parameter to M_DEFAULT_KEY simultaneously. For specifying the entry's index Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the EntryIndex parameter is not required. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the index of an entry. EntryKey Specifies the key (MIL_UUID) of the entry for which to get results. The key is defined as a MIL universal unique identifier (UUID). When specifying a key with the EntryKey parameter, you must set the EntryIndex parameter to M_DEFAULT. You cannot set the EntryKey parameter to M_DEFAULT_KEY and the EntryIndex parameter to M_DEFAULT simultaneously. For specifying the entry's key Value Description M_DEFAULT_KEY Specifies that the EntryKey parameter is not required. MIL_UUID Value Specifies the key (MIL_UUID) of an entry. TaskType Specifies the task (classification, segmentation, object detection, or anomaly detection) for which to get results. An entry in an images dataset can contain classification, segmentation, object detection, or anomaly detection results. An entry in a features dataset can only contain classification results. For specifying the type of task for which to get results Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_ANOMALY_DETECTION Specifies that you are getting anomaly detection results. M_AUTO Specifies the task for which to get results automatically, given the content in the dataset used (DatasetContextClassId). If the dataset selected is an images dataset, and it contains only image classification results, M_AUTO is the same as M_CLASSIFICATION. If the dataset contains only segmentation results, M_AUTO is the same as M_SEGMENTATION. If the dataset only contains object detection results, M_AUTO is the same as M_OBJECT_DETECTION. If the dataset only contains anomaly detection results, M_AUTO is the same as M_ANOMALY_DETECTION. If the dataset contains two types of results, then M_AUTO is the same as M_SEGMENTATION (if segmentation results are present), or M_CLASSIFICATION (if no segmentation results are present). If a result type (ResultType) is specified that only applies to object detection, M_AUTO is the same as M_OBJECT_DETECTION. If the dataset contains image classification, segmentation, object detection, and anomaly detection results, M_AUTO is the same as M_SEGMENTATION. If the dataset selected is a features dataset, M_AUTO is the same as M_CLASSIFICATION, since segmentation and object detection are not supported for a features dataset. To determine whether M_CLASSIFICATION, M_SEGMENTATION, M_OBJECT_DETECTION, or M_ANOMALY_DETECTION results are available in the dataset, use the M_PREDICT_INFO result. Typically, a dataset should be set up for a specific task (either image classification, segmentation, object detection, or anomaly detection). M_CLASSIFICATION Specifies that you are getting classification results (image or feature). M_OBJECT_DETECTION Specifies that you are getting object detection results. M_SEGMENTATION Specifies that you are getting segmentation results. LabelOrIndex Specifies the class for which to get the entry result, or specifies that you are getting a general entry result. The values in this table are available for all tasks unless otherwise specified. Set this parameter to one of the following values. For specifying the class for which to get the entry result, or specifies to get a general entry result Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_GENERAL. M_CLASS_INDEX( MIL_INT ClassIndex ) Specifies the index of the class for which to get the entry result. To get the number of classes, use M_NUMBER_OF_CLASSES. Parameters ClassIndex Specifies the index of a class. M_INSTANCE_INDEX( MIL_INT InstanceIndex ) Specifies the index of the instance for which to get results. You can get the number of included instances in the result buffer using M_NUMBER_OF_INSTANCES. This is only available for images datasets with object detection results. Parameters InstanceIndex Specifies the index of an instance. M_ALL_INSTANCES Specifies to retrieve results for all instances. This is only available for images datasets with object detection results. M_GENERAL Specifies to get a general entry result. ResultType Specifies the type of result to retrieve from the dataset entry. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ResultArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] array of type MIL_ID [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_ID&gt; ] array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] array of type MIL_INT32 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT32&gt; ] array of type MIL_INT64 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT64&gt; ] MIL_DOUBLE MIL_ID MIL_INT MIL_INT32 MIL_INT64 Specifies the address of the array in which to write results. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be returned. Parameter associations The tables below list possible values for the ResultType parameter and possible values returned to the ResultArrayPtr parameter. For retrieving general entry results (images or features dataset) For retrieving general entry results (images dataset) For retrieving general or class-specific entry results For retrieving results for a specific class, a specific object detection instance, or all instances (images dataset) To retrieve general results from an entry in the images or features dataset (DatasetContextClassId), the ResultType parameter can be set to one of the following values. In this case, you must set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_GENERAL unless otherwise specified. You can retrieve results for any task (TaskType). For retrieving general entry results (images or features dataset) ResultType Description ResultArrayPtr - Possible values returned M_BEST_CLASS_INDEX Retrieves the index of the class with the highest score for the entry. For classification, M_BEST_CLASS_INDEX retrieves one index. For segmentation, M_BEST_CLASS_INDEX retrieves an array of values (indices) that can be arranged in a 2D image, where the size is equal to M_PREDICTION_SIZE_X * M_PREDICTION_SIZE_Y. Each value is the index of the best class score for that X- Y-pixel location. The index of the class begins at 0. For object detection, to retrieve the class index with the highest score for all instances, set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_ALL_INSTANCES.

Syntax void MclassHookFunction( MIL_ID&nbsp;ClassId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;HookType, //in MIL_CLASS_HOOK_FUNCTION_PTR&nbsp;HookHandlerPtr, //in void&nbsp;*UserDataPtr //in-out ) Description This function allows you to attach or detach a user-defined function to a classification object event (for example, during the execution of MclassTrain() or MclassPredict()). Once a hook-handler function is defined and hooked to an event, it is automatically called when the event occurs. You can hook more than one function to an event by making separate calls to MclassHookFunction() for each function that you want to hook. MIL automatically chains and keeps an internal list of all these hooked functions. When a function is hooked, this new function is added to the end of the list. When the event happens, all user-defined functions in the list will be executed in the same order that they were hooked to the event. You can also remove any function from the list; in this case, MIL preserves the order of the remaining functions in the list. You can obtain information concerning the event, using MclassGetHookInfo(), and take appropriate action before returning control to the application. For the most recent documentation of this function, particularly as it relates to dataset statistics (MclassStatCalculate()), check for an updated version of the MIL Help online at zebra.com/aurora-imaging-library-help. Parameters Parameters ClassId Specifies the identifier of the classification object onto which to attach a hook-handler. Set this parameter to one of the following values. For specifying the identifier of the classification object Value Description ContextClassifierId Specifies the identifier of a predefined CNN, predefined object detection, predefined segmentation, predefined anomaly detection, or tree ensemble classifier context. These contexts must have been previously allocated on the required system using MclassAlloc() with M_CLASSIFIER_CNN_PREDEFINED, M_CLASSIFIER_DET_PREDEFINED, M_CLASSIFIER_SEG_PREDEFINED, M_CLASSIFIER_ANO_PREDEFINED or M_CLASSIFIER_TREE_ENSEMBLE. ContextDataPreparationId Specifies the identifier of a data preparation context. This context must have been previously allocated on the required system using MclassAlloc() with M_PREPARE_IMAGES_CNN, M_PREPARE_IMAGES_DET or M_PREPARE_IMAGES_SEG. ContextDatasetId Specifies the identifier of an images or features dataset context. These contexts must have been previously allocated on the required system using MclassAlloc() with M_DATASET_IMAGES or M_DATASET_FEATURES. ContextTrainId Specifies the identifier of a CNN, object detection, segmentation, anomaly detection, or tree ensemble training context. These contexts must have been previously allocated on the required system using MclassAlloc() with M_TRAIN_CNN, M_TRAIN_DET, M_TRAIN_SEG, M_TRAIN_ANO or M_TRAIN_TREE_ENSEMBLE. HookType Specifies the event type. Set this parameter to one of the following values. For specifying the event type Value Description M_DATASETS_PREPARED Calls the hook-handler function when the training and development datasets are prepared and available in the training results. You can use M_DATASETS_PREPARED with a training context when training a CNN, object detection, segmentation, or anomaly detection classifier (ClassId). M_EPOCH_TRAINED Calls the hook-handler function each time the training process is completed for an epoch. This is typically used to plot a graph of the training process. You can use M_EPOCH_TRAINED with a training context when training a CNN, object detection, or segmentation classifier (ClassId). M_MINI_BATCH_TRAINED Calls the hook-handler function each time the training process is completed for a given mini-batch within the current epoch. You can use M_MINI_BATCH_TRAINED with a training context when training a CNN, object detection, segmentation, or anomaly detection classifier (ClassId). M_PREDICT_ENTRY Calls the hook-handler function each time the prediction is completed for a dataset entry. You can use M_PREDICT_ENTRY with a classifier context when performing a prediction with a trained CNN, object detection, segmentation, anomaly detection, or tree ensemble classifier and an images or features dataset (ClassId). M_PREPARE_ENTRY_POST Calls the hook-handler function after each entry is prepared. This lets you track the progress of the data preparation, and how close it is to completing. The data preparation operation is done when the number of prepared entries is equal to the number of entries in the source dataset. It is possible that some source images (entries) are not used; to know which, access the status of the previous preparation. You can use M_PREPARE_ENTRY_POST when preparing data with a data preparation context (ClassId). M_PREPARE_ENTRY_PRE Calls the hook-handler function before each entry is prepared. Set this hook type when you want to use a custom algorithm to determine the center around which to crop your images. That is, you are given the identifier of the image buffer, which you can then use in a customized way to select the center of the image, and then set that center with MclassSetHookInfo(). You can use M_PREPARE_ENTRY_PRE when preparing data with a data preparation context (ClassId). M_SAMPLE_ADDED Calls the hook-handler function each time the training process is completed for a given sample. You can use M_SAMPLE_ADDED with a training context when training an anomaly detection classifier (ClassId). M_TREE_TRAINED Calls the hook-handler function each time the training process is completed for a tree. You can use M_TREE_TRAINED with a training context when training a tree ensemble classifier (ClassId). M_WRITE_NEW_FILE Calls the hook-handler function each time a file is written to disk when certain MIL functions are called (for example, MclassEntryAddRegion() and MclassPredict() with a segmentation classifier context). You can use M_WRITE_NEW_FILE with an images dataset context (ClassId). Combination value for any of the possible values of the HookType parameter. You can add the following value to the above-mentioned values to set whether to detach the hook-handler function. For the HookType parameter Combination value Description M_UNHOOK Unhooks the specified function if hooked to the specified event. When you use M_UNHOOK, you must provide the same values for all the parameters as when you originally hooked the function. HookHandlerPtr Specifies the address of the function that should be called when an event occurs. The hook-handler function, pointed to by HookHandlerPtr, must be declared as follows: MIL_INT MFTYPE HookHandler( MIL_INT HookType, MIL_ID EventId, void *UserDataPtr ) Parameters HookType Specifies the type of event that generated the call. EventId Event identifier to pass to MclassGetHookInfo() when inquiring about the hooked event. UserDataPtr User data pointer that was passed to the UserDataPr parameter of MclassHookFunction(). Upon successful completion, the hook-handler function should return M_NULL. Note, MFTYPE and MIL_CLASS_HOOK_FUNCTION_PTR are reserved MIL predefined types for functions and data pointers, respectively. UserDataPtr Specifies the address of the user data that you want to make available to the hook-handler function. This address is passed to the hook-handler function, through its UserDataPtr parameter, when the specified event occurs. Set this parameter to M_NULL if user data is not required.

Syntax void MclassImport( MIL_CONST_TEXT_PTR&nbsp;FileNameOrFolderPath, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;FileOrPathFormat, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DatasetOrClassifierContextId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Index, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ImportType, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function imports data from a CSV file or folder to a dataset context (images or features), or imports data from an ONNX file to an ONNX classifier context. MIL appends imported data from a CSV file or folder to any existing data in the dataset. To export data from a dataset, use MclassExport(). Parameters Parameters FileNameOrFolderPath Specifies the name and path of a file, or specifies a folder, from which to import. When specifying the name and path of a file, the function handles (internally) the opening and closing of that file. Also, for easier use with other Matrox Imaging software products, the specified file name must use the CSV or ONNX file extension. A CSV file represents a common format that holds comma separated values. An ONNX file is a platform-neutral and language-neutral open source file format for describing machine learning models. Set this parameter to one of the values below. For specifying the file name and path Value Description M_INTERACTIVE [This is only applicable to Windows] Opens a dialog box from which to interactively specify the file's drive, directory, and name. MIL_TEXT(\"FileNameOrFolderPath\") 1 Specifies the required information for the file or folder from which to import. For a file, you must specify its drive, directory, and name (for example, \"E:\\Manual\\MySweetSweetDataset.csv\" or \"E:\\Manual\\MySweetSweetClassifierContext.onnx\"). For a folder, you must specify its drive and directory (for example, \"E:\\Manual\\MySweetDatasetFolder\"). To specify a dataset file on a remote computer (under Distributed MIL), prefix the file name string with \"remote:///\" (for example, \"remote:///E:\\Manual\\\\MyEvenSweeterDataset.csv\"). 1 If you are passing the value in a variable, don't enclose it in MIL_TEXT(). FileOrPathFormat Specifies the format of the file or path from which to import. Set this parameter to one of the following values. For specifying the file format Value Description M_FORMAT_CSV Specifies a CSV file format. In this case, set the DatasetOrClassifierContextId parameter to the identifier of an images or features dataset. When importing from a CSV file, note the following: Field values with commas must delimit them within double quotation marks. If an entry refers to a non-existing class label, MIL adds it to the dataset with default initial values. When no BOM (Byte-Order-Marker) is encoded in the file, the encoding character UTF-8 is used. The CSV file must adhere to formatting requirements and contain the required data; this can depend on what you are importing, as specified by the ImportType parameter. M_IMAGE_DATASET_FOLDER Specifies a path to an existing folder. In this case, set the DatasetOrClassifierContextId parameter to the identifier of an images dataset. When importing from a folder, note the following: You should follow the MIL folder structure, as described in MclassExport(). If the dataset you are importing was exported with M_IMAGE_DATASET_FOLDER_ALLOW_RENAME, MIL cannot guarantee that the import will successfully restore the exported dataset. MIL might modify the root path (M_ROOT_PATH) in the dataset, if one is specified, to maintain the dataset's coherence. For example, dataset paths should all be either relative or absolute. M_ONNX_FILE Specifies an ONNX file format. In this case, set the DatasetOrClassifierContextId parameter to the identifier of an ONNX classifier context. When importing an ONNX file, note the following: The supported ONNX file format version (ir_version) is from 3 to 8, inclusive. The supported ONNX operator set version is from 7 to 15, inclusive. The ONNX model must have a single operator set domain. This domain must be either \"ai.onnx\" or an empty string (\"\"). The network must have one input. The input type must be a dense tensor, that is, an array where the elements are all sequential starting at index 0. The tensor element type must be either float32, uint8, uint16, int8, int16 or int32. The tensor dimensionality (rank) must range from 1 to 4. MIL follows the NCHW convention, that is \"Number in batch\" x \"Channels\" x \"Height\" x \"Width\" or, in MIL terminology, \"size batch\" x \"size band\" x \"size Y\" x \"size X\". MIL will automatically assign values of 1 to the missing higher (leftmost) dimensions for inputs of lower dimensionality. For instance, given an input tensor with 2 dimensions, MIL will assign values of 1 to N and C and define HW based on the tensor. Each dimension must be expressed either with an integer value greater than 0 or using a dimension variable string. MIL only support 1 as the integer value of dimension N. Dimension variables are allowed at import time but must be defined by the user with MclassControl() with M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_X, M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_Y, M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_BAND calls prior to calling MclassPreprocess(). Dimension variables for the size batch (N) are internally set to 1. The network must have at least one output. All output type must be dense tensor. The tensor element types must be either float16, float32, float64, uint8, uint16, int8, int16, int32 or int64. The tensors must have at least one dimension. Each dimension must be expressed either with an integral value greater than 0 or using a dimension variable string. Outputs are filled at MclassPredict() and are retrieved using MclassGetResult(). The graph of the model must be free of cycles. The ONNX model must pass the ONNX function onnx::checker::check_model() without error. DatasetOrClassifierContextId Specifies the identifier of the dataset or classifier context in which to import. Set this parameter to one of the following values. For specifying the dataset or classifier context in which to import Value Description ContextClassifierId Specifies the identifier of an ONNX classifier context. This context is allocated using MclassAlloc() with M_CLASSIFIER_ONNX. ContextDatasetId Specifies the identifier of a features or images dataset context. This context is allocated using MclassAlloc() with M_DATASET_FEATURES or M_DATASET_IMAGES. Index Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. ImportType Specifies the type of import operation to perform. Typically, you will import an entire dataset with M_COMPLETE. When importing specific files, the order in which you import data is important. You should import authors and class definitions first, and then import entries, as entries require authors and class definitions. If you only import entries, MIL automatically creates class definitions and authors according to the information in the entries. If you import class definitions or authors afterward, MIL appends them to the already existing ones. If MIL encounters non-existing class definitions or authors when importing entries, they are automatically added to the dataset using default values. Set this parameter to one of the following values. For specifying the type of the file that you can import Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies to import an ONNX file. M_AUTHORS Specifies to import authors from a CSV file. In this case, use the headers below (and provide the corresponding lines of information after the header) in the CSV file. Key,AuthorName Both of these fields are required. M_CLASS_DEFINITIONS Specifies to import class definitions from a CSV file. In this case, use the headers below (and provide the corresponding lines of information after the header) in the CSV file. Key,Name,Color_R,Color_G,Color_B,Weight,Icon,Anomalous The 'Key' and 'Name' fields are required; the others are optional. M_COMPLETE Specifies to import the entire folder into the dataset. This includes authors (CSV), class definitions (CSV), controls (CSV), entries (images and CSV), descriptors (images and CSV), segmentation files (MIL buffers), prediction results (CSV), and icons (images). To use it, the FileOrPathFormat parameter must be set to M_IMAGE_DATASET_FOLDER. In this case, use the headers below (and provide the corresponding lines of information after the headers) in the CSV file. Headers for controls.csv files. ControlType,ControlValue Note: Currently supported control types (and associated control values) are M_NO_CLASS_DRAW_COLOR, M_NO_REGION_PIXEL_CLASS, and M_DONT_CARE_CLASS_DRAW_COLOR. If you are importing into a newly allocated dataset, the control values for these control types (as specified in your folder) are imported into the dataset; otherwise, the control values (as specified in your folder) must be the same as those in the dataset you are importing into.

Syntax void MclassPredict( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextClassId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;TargetMilObjectId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DatasetContextOrResultClassId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function uses a trained classifier context to predict the class to which the target belongs or the position of objects in the target. For a trained CNN, segmentation, object detection, or anomaly detection classifier context, you can specify an image or an images dataset context as the target. For a trained tree ensemble classifier context, you can specify an array of features or a features dataset context as the target. For a trained ONNX classifier, you can only specify an image. This function is typically called with a target image (for image classification, segmentation, object detection, or anomaly detection) or with a target array of features (for feature classification). In these cases, results are stored in a result buffer (DatasetContextOrResultClassId) and retrievable using MclassGetResult(). You can also call this function with a target dataset. In this case, the predicted data is stored in a dataset context (DatasetContextOrResultClassId). Calling MclassPredict() with a dataset can be done, for example, to predict the class that represents the dataset's entries, which you can retrieve using MclassGetResultEntry() with M_BEST_CLASS_INDEX. You can then use these predictions to help manually define the ground truth of the entries during training. Before calling MclassPredict(), the classifier context must be in a preprocessed state (MclassPreprocess()) and it must be trained (MclassTrain()). To inquire this information, use M_PREPROCESSED and M_CLASSIFIER_STATUS. If your target is a dataset context, you can hook functions to prediction events, using MclassHookFunction() (for example, with M_PREDICT_ENTRY). To get information about the events that caused the hook-handler function to execute, call MclassGetHookInfo(). Classification contexts and result buffers must have been previously allocated on the required system using MclassAlloc() and MclassAllocResult(), or restored from disk using MclassRestore(). Note, you can also call MclassPredict() with an images dataset context to perform assisted labeling (that is, label images in an existing dataset). By default, MclassPredict() uses the default predict engine established by the MILConfig utility. You can modify this by calling MclassControl() with M_PREDICT_ENGINE or in MILConfig. To take advantage of all available hardware resources, such as accelerating prediction using OpenVINO and CUDA, you should install the required MIL X Service Pack add-on. For more information, see the MIL add-ons and updates subsection of the Requirements, recommendations, and troubleshooting section of Chapter 47: Machine learning with the MIL Classification module. Parameters Parameters ContextClassId Specifies the identifier of the trained classifier context to use for the prediction operation. You can specify a trained CNN classifier context (M_CLASSIFIER_CNN_PREDEFINED), a trained segmentation classifier context (M_CLASSIFIER_SEG_PREDEFINED), a trained object detection classifier context (M_CLASSIFIER_DET_PREDEFINED), a trained anomaly detection classifier (M_CLASSIFIER_ANO_PREDEFINED), a trained tree ensemble classifier context (M_CLASSIFIER_TREE_ENSEMBLE), or a trained ONNX classifier context (M_CLASSIFIER_ONNX). TargetMilObjectId Specifies the identifier of the target to classify. Set this parameter to one of the following values: For specifying the target to classify Value Description ArrayBufId Specifies the identifier of a one-dimensional 32-bit float array that holds a list of features. In this case, the prediction operation will predict the best class to which the array of features belongs. The number of features in the array must be the same as the number of trained features in the dataset used to train the classifier context (DatasetContextOrResultClassId). To specify an array, you must set the ContextClassId parameter to the identifier of a trained tree ensemble classifier context. ContextDatasetId Specifies the identifier of a features or images dataset context. For CNN and tree ensemble classifiers, the prediction operation will predict the best class to which each dataset entry (feature list or image) belongs. For segmentation classifiers, the prediction operation will predict the best class to which each pixel belongs in a image entry. For object detection classifiers, the prediction operation will detect the positions of each object in an image entry. For anomaly detection classifiers, the prediction operation will predict the anomaly score of the target image as well as the anomaly score for each pixel within the image. For image datasets, you must set the ContextClassId parameter to the identifier of a trained CNN, segmentation, object detection, or anomaly detection classifier context. For feature datasets, you must set the ContextClassId parameter to the identifier of a trained tree ensemble. ImageBufId Specifies the identifier of a 1- or 3-band target image. When ContextClassId is a trained CNN classifier context, the prediction operation will predict the best class to which the target image belongs. When ContextClassId is a trained segmentation classifier context, the prediction operation will predict the class of each pixel within the target image. When ContextClassId is a trained object detection classifier context, the prediction operation will detect the position of each object within the image. When ContextClassId is a trained anomaly detection classifier context, the prediction operation will predict the anomaly score of the target image as well as the anomaly score for each pixel within the image. You must set the ContextClassId parameter to the identifier of a trained CNN, segmentation, object detection, anomaly detection or ONNX classifier context. When predicting for image classification (using M_ICNET_...), the target image size must be the same as the training images. When predicting for segmentation (using M_CSNET_...), or if you are using a predefined legacy classifier (M_FCNET_...), the target image size can be bigger than the training images (this requires calling MclassControl() with M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_X and M_TARGET_IMAGE_SIZE_Y). By default, MIL considers the size of the target image to be the same as the source layer size. DatasetContextOrResultClassId Specifies the identifier of the result buffer or dataset in which to write the results of the prediction operation. Set this parameter to one of the following values: For specifying the result buffer or dataset in which to write the results of the prediction Value Description ContextDatasetId Specifies the identifier of a features dataset context (M_DATASET_FEATURES) or images dataset context (M_DATASET_IMAGES). You must call MclassPredict() with a features or images dataset context as your target (TargetMilObjectId). The dataset context specified by the DatasetContextOrResultClassId parameter must either be empty, or be the same dataset as your target. If the destination is an images dataset context, MIL might modify its root path (M_ROOT_PATH), if one is specified, to maintain the dataset's coherence. For example, dataset paths should all be either relative or absolute. ResultBufPredictId Specifies the identifier of a CNN prediction result buffer (M_PREDICT_CNN_RESULT), a segmentation prediction result buffer (M_PREDICT_SEG_RESULT), an object detection prediction result buffer (M_PREDICT_DET_RESULT), an anomaly detection prediction result buffer (M_PREDICT_ANO_RESULT) a tree ensemble prediction result buffer (M_PREDICT_TREE_ENSEMBLE_RESULT), or an ONNX prediction result buffer (M_PREDICT_ONNX_RESULT). In this case, you must call MclassPredict() with an image or an array of features as your target (TargetMilObjectId). ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT.

Syntax void MclassPrepareData( MIL_ID&nbsp;PrepareDataContextClassId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcDatasetContextOrImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstDatasetContextOrImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;ClassifierContextClassId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function creates prepared (modified) versions of images in a dataset for training (MclassTrain()), or an individual image for prediction (MclassPredict()). You can, for example, use this function to resize or crop images, or add augmented images to a dataset. Some preparations are only available for training. MclassPrepareData() requires a data preparation context (MclassAlloc() with M_PREPARE_IMAGES_CNN, M_PREPARE_IMAGES_DET or M_PREPARE_IMAGES_SEG) that is preprocessed (MclassPreprocess()). To inquire the context's preprocessing state, call MclassInquire() with M_PREPROCESSED. Note that MclassPrepareData() does not support preparing signed images. The data preparation context (PrepareDataContextClassId) holds the settings with which to modify the specified source (SrcDatasetContextOrImageBufId). To change the data preparation context settings, call MclassControl(). For example, you can use the M_SIZE_... controls to set the size of the images that MclassPrepareData() produces, or you can use the M_AUGMENT_NUMBER_ABSOLUTE control to set the number of augmented entries to add to the destination dataset. You can consider data preparation as taking the specified source data (SrcDatasetContextOrImageBufId), modifying it (according to your data preparation settings), and copying the modified version into the specified destination (DstDatasetContextOrImageBufId). One image in your source can result in multiple modified images in your destination, depending on your data preparation settings. Source data is not modified. Class definitions and authors are copied from the source dataset to the destination, if they do not exist in the destination. If using a newly allocated destination dataset for segmentation, control values for M_NO_REGION_PIXEL_CLASS, M_NO_CLASS_DRAW_COLOR, and M_DONT_CARE_CLASS_DRAW_COLOR are copied to the destination; otherwise, these values must be the same for the source and destination datasets. To prepare your data with specific, preset augmentations, you can call MclassControl() and enable the M_PRESET... augmentation operation setting. Some preset augmentation settings are not available for binary (1-bit) and grayscale (1-band) images. Alternatively, you can access additional types of augmentation operations using the data preparation context's internal augmentation context. This context is automatically managed by MIL (you need not allocate it or free it) and is an internal version of the image processing context for augmentation (that is, MimAlloc() with M_AUGMENTATION_CONTEXT). To specify the additional augmentations, you must first inquire the identifier of this internal augmentation context, by calling MclassInquire() with M_AUGMENT_CONTEXT_ID. You can then use that augmentation context identifier with MimControl() and enable the augmentation operation (M_AUG_..._OP). MIL only performs augmentations on a source dataset (SrcDatasetContextOrImageBufId); if you specify a source image buffer, augmentation settings are ignored (cropping/resizing settings are applied). MclassPrepareData() only adds augmented images to the destination dataset if at least one augmentation operation is enabled; by default; no augmentations are enabled. The modified (cropped/resized or augmented) images that this function produces are placed in the specified dataset context or image buffer (DstDatasetContextOrImageBufId), depending on the source you want to prepare (SrcDatasetContextOrImageBufId). The images are also placed in the destination folder, specified by the M_PREPARED_DATA_FOLDER control. By default, each time you call this function, a new PrepareX folder is created, where X is the next available value to create a unique folder name. You can change this behavior with the M_DESTINATION_FOLDER_MODE control. All the images that this function produces (and copies into the prepared data folder) are MIMs (MIL images) and named as follows: OriginalName_Prp_AugmentationNumber.mim. For example, if MclassPrepareData() produces three augmentations of Abyssinian.mim, they would be named Abyssinian_Prp_1.mim, Abyssinian_Prp_2.mim, and Abyssinian_Prp_3.mim. The suffix '0' is reserved for images that are prepared but not augmented (for example, Abyssinian_Prp_0.mim would be a cropped/resized copy of the original image). To hook functions to data preparation events, call MclassHookFunction(). Parameters Parameters PrepareDataContextClassId Specifies the identifier of the data preparation context that this function uses to modify the source image data. This context must have been previously allocated on the required system using MclassAlloc() with M_PREPARE_IMAGES_CNN, M_PREPARE_IMAGES_DET, or M_PREPARE_IMAGES_SEG and it must be in a preprocessed state before calling MclassPrepareData(). SrcDatasetContextOrImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source images dataset context or image buffer. You must have previously allocated the specified source on the required system using either MclassAlloc() with M_DATASET_IMAGES or MbufAlloc...() with M_IMAGE. If you specify an images dataset context, all specified augmentations are applied. If you specify an image buffer, augmentations are not applied; however, any specified cropping or resizing operations are performed, such as those set with the M_SIZE_... controls. This is typically done to make images conform to those used during the training process. DstDatasetContextOrImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination images dataset context or image buffer. The type of destination must be same as the source (SrcDatasetContextOrImageBufId); that is, the destination must be an image dataset context if the source is an image dataset context, and an image buffer if the source is an image buffer. You cannot specify the same dataset or image for both the SrcDatasetContextOrImageBufId and DstDatasetContextOrImageBufId parameters. If you specify a destination image buffer, it must have the same number of bands, data type, and depth as the source image buffer. The size of the destination buffer is established by the predefined CNN, predefined object detection, or predefined segmentation classifier context that you are using, as well as the mode (M_SIZE_MODE) and size controls (M_SIZE_X and M_SIZE_Y) of the data preparation context. MIL chooses a default size that is typically suitable, however the requirements of your application might require you to change it. If you specify an images dataset context, all specified augmentations are applied. If you specify an image buffer, augmentations are not applied; however, any specified cropping or resizing operations are performed, such as those set with the M_SIZE_... controls. This is typically done to make images conform to those used in the training dataset. If you specify an images dataset context, MIL might modify its root path (M_ROOT_PATH), if one is specified, to maintain the dataset's coherence. For example, dataset paths should all be either relative or absolute. ClassifierContextClassId Specifies the identifier of the predefined CNN, predefined object detection, or predefined segmentation classifier context that this function uses to prepare your image data. This context is allocated using MclassAlloc() with M_CLASSIFIER_CNN_PREDEFINED, M_CLASSIFIER_DET_PREDEFINED, or M_CLASSIFIER_SEG_PREDEFINED. To not use a classifier context, or if the size mode specified by MclassControl() is M_USER_DEFINED, you must set this parameter to M_NULL. If you specify an untrained CNN, object detection, or segmentation classifier context, it must hold an ICNet, ODNet, or CSNet classifier (if necessary, it can also hold a legacy FCNet classifier). MIL uses the sizing requirements of the classifier to establish the image size. If you specify a trained CNN, object detection, or segmentation classifier context, MIL uses the size of the source layer to establish the image size. If you do not specify a classifier context, MIL establishes the size of the destination images using the size mode control (M_SIZE_MODE) and, depending on its specified value, the resizing controls (M_RESIZE_SCALE_FACTOR, M_SIZE_X, and M_SIZE_Y), or the source image size. If a trained classifier is passed, you must set M_SIZE_MODE to M_AUTO. Typically, the ClassifierContextClassId parameter is set to an untrained classifier when preparing datasets (SrcDatasetContextOrImageBufId), and to a trained classifier when preparing images (SrcDatasetContextOrImageBufId). This function is usually called with a trained classifier when you want to modify images to conform to the already established training data.

Syntax void MclassPreprocess( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextClassId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function preprocesses a classification context for data preparation (MclassPrepareData()), training (MclassTrain()), statistics calculation (MclassStatCalculate()), or prediction (MclassPredict()). You must call MclassPreprocess() before the first call to any of these functions. During preprocessing, MIL analyzes the content of the context and makes internal refinements to execute an optimized and robust operation. Changes to a context or any of its content often require preprocessing the context again. To inquire whether you should preprocess the context, call MclassInquire() with M_PREPROCESSED. The context must be in a preprocessed state before calling the data preparation, training, or prediction operation. Saving a context does not save preprocessing changes. Upon restoration, you must preprocess the context again before calling MclassPrepareData(), MclassTrain(), MclassStatCalculate(), or MclassPredict(). For the most recent documentation of this function, particularly as it relates to dataset statistics (MclassStatCalculate()), check for an updated version of the MIL Help online at zebra.com/aurora-imaging-library-help. Parameters Parameters ContextClassId Specifies the identifier of the classification context to preprocess. The classification context must have been previously allocated on the required system using MclassAlloc() with M_PREPARE_IMAGES_CNN, M_PREPARE_IMAGES_DET, M_PREPARE_IMAGES_SEG, M_TRAIN_CNN, M_TRAIN_DET, M_TRAIN_SEG, M_TRAIN_ANO, M_TRAIN_TREE_ENSEMBLE, M_CLASSIFIER_CNN_PREDEFINED, M_CLASSIFIER_DET_PREDEFINED, M_CLASSIFIER_SEG_PREDEFINED, M_CLASSIFIER_ANO_PREDEFINED, or M_CLASSIFIER_TREE_ENSEMBLE. ControlFlag Specifies whether to preprocess the classification context. Set this parameter to one of the following values: For specifying whether to preprocess the context Value Description M_DEFAULT Preprocesses the context. M_RESET Un-preprocesses the context. Un-preprocessing the context can be useful if you want to conserve system memory within an application and preserve context settings. Compilation information Header Include mil.h.

Syntax MIL_ID MclassRestore( MIL_CONST_TEXT_PTR&nbsp;FileName, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*ContextClassIdPtr //out ) Description This function restores a MIL Classification context (classifier, dataset, data preparation, or training) that was previously saved to a file, using MclassSave() or MclassStream(). This function restores all of the context's settings that were in effect when it was saved. A restored context is not preprocessed; if the context requires preprocessing, you must call MclassPreprocess() before calling MclassTrain() or MclassPredict(). Note, it is possible to restore a pretrained CNN, object detection, segmentation, or anomaly detection classifier context that Matrox has built and trained to address your specific requirements (as opposed to a predefined CNN, object detection, segmentation, anomaly detection classifier context that you have trained). For more information about having Matrox provide this service to you, contact customer support. When the restored classifier, dataset, data preparation, or training context is no longer required, release it using MclassFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during allocation; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the context's lifetime and you must not manually free it. Parameters Parameters FileName Specifies the name and path of the file from which to restore the classification context (classifier, dataset, data preparation, or training). The function handles (internally) the opening and closing of the file. For easier use with other Matrox Imaging software products, classifier context, data preparation context, and training context files should have an MCLASS extension. Dataset context files should have an MCLASSD extension. Set this parameter to one of the values below: For specifying the file name and path of the context to restore Value Description M_INTERACTIVE [This is only applicable to Windows] Opens a dialog box from which you can interactively specify the drive, directory, and name of the file. MIL_TEXT(\"FileName\") 1 Specifies the drive, directory, and name of the classification context file (for example, \"C:\\mydirectory\\WePutTheArtInArtificialIntelligence.mclass\"). Classifier context, data preparation context, and training context files should have an MCLASS extension. Dataset context files should have an MCLASSD extension. To specify a context file on a remote computer (under Distributed MIL), prefix the specified file name string with \"remote:///\" (for example, \"remote:///C:\\mydirectory\\WePutTheArtInArtificialIntelligence.mclass\"). 1 If you are passing the value in a variable, don't enclose it in MIL_TEXT(). SysId Specifies the identifier of the system on which to restore the classification context (classifier, dataset, data preparation, or training) to disk. Set this parameter to one of the values below: For specifying the system identifier Value Description M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. ContextClassIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the classifier, dataset, data preparation, or training context identifier or specifies the data type that the function should use to return the context identifier. For retrieving the identifier or specifying how to return it Value Description M_NULL Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated classifier, dataset, data preparation, or training data context ; in this case, a standard MIL identifier of type MIL_ID is returned. M_UNIQUE_ID Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated classifier, dataset, data preparation, or training data context ; in this case, a MIL smart identifier of type MIL_UNIQUE_CLASS_ID is returned instead of a standard MIL identifier. This setting is only available when using C++11 (or later). A MIL smart identifier manages the lifespan of the MIL object it owns (similar to a std::unique_ptr). Note, you can use a MIL smart identifier as though it were a standard MIL identifier, except that you cannot use it to manually free the classifier, dataset, data preparation, or training data context (it is freed automatically). For more information, see the MIL smart identifiers subsection of the MIL custom data types, void pointers, extensions, and portability functions section of Chapter 2: Building an application. Address in which to write the classifier context identifier Specifies the address of a MIL_ID in which to write the identifier of the allocated classifier context. If restoration fails, M_NULL is written as the identifier. Address in which to write the data preparation context identifier Specifies the address of a MIL_ID in which to write the identifier of the allocated data preparation context. If restoration fails, M_NULL is written as the identifier.

Syntax void MclassSplitDataset( MIL_ID&nbsp;SplitContextClassId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcDatasetContextClassId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstFirstDatasetContextClassId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstSecondDatasetContextClassId, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Percentage, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SplitResultClassId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function splits the source dataset context into two destination dataset contexts, according to a percentage. This is typically done to split all of your data (SrcDatasetContextClassId) into the training dataset context (DstFirstDatasetContextClassId) and the development dataset context (DstSecondDatasetContextClassId), which you will use with MclassTrain() to train your classifier context. This function ensures that the proper portion of entries for each class in the source dataset context are in both the first and second destination dataset contexts. You can consider the split to be a type of copy of dataset entries from the source dataset to either the first or second destination dataset. All source dataset entries are copied (including class definitions) and unaltered. Entries already in the destination are overwritten. All datasets (source and destinations) must be for the same classification task; that is, you must have allocated all of them with either M_DATASET_IMAGES (for image classification, object detection, segmentation, or anomaly detection) or M_DATASET_FEATURES (for feature classification). To establish the first and second destination dataset contexts, MIL randomly selects source entries for the split. Typically, a different random selection of entries is chosen each time you call this function. To select the same random entries, use M_SPLIT_..._FIXED_SEED. If the source dataset context contains augmented entries, they can end up in both the first and second destination dataset contexts. In this case, you must not use one of these destinations as your development dataset context or testing dataset context, since only the training dataset context can contain augmented entries. To inquire whether the source dataset contexts have augmented entries, use M_NUMBER_OF_AUGMENTED_ENTRIES. An augmented entry is never split from the source entry with which it was augmented. This can cause the percentage of entries in the first and second destination dataset contexts to differ from the specified percentage. If you do not have augmented data, source entries are only copied to one destination. Parameters Parameters SplitContextClassId Specifies the predefined split classification context. This predefined context establishes whether to use a different random selection of entries to split the source dataset context, or to use the random selection of entries associated to a fixed seed. Set this parameter to one of the following values: For specifying the predefined split classification context Value Description M_SPLIT_ANO_CONTEXT_DEFAULT Specifies to use a different random selection of entries from the source dataset context to establish the first and second destination dataset contexts, for anomaly detection. M_SPLIT_ANO_CONTEXT_FIXED_SEED Specifies to use the random selection of entries that is associated to a fixed seed, for anomaly detection. In this case, the first and second destination dataset contexts are established using the same random selection of entries from the source dataset context. This allows you to repeat the same split operation, provided you make an identical call to MclassSplitDataset() (that is, you specify the same dataset contexts and split percentage). M_SPLIT_CONTEXT_DEFAULT Specifies to use a different random selection of entries from the source dataset context to establish the first and second destination dataset contexts, for image classification (CNN) or feature classification (tree ensemble). M_SPLIT_CONTEXT_FIXED_SEED Specifies to use the random selection of entries that are associated to a fixed seed, for image classification (CNN) or feature classification (tree ensemble). In this case, the first and second destination dataset contexts are established using the same random selection of entries from the source dataset context. This allows you to repeat the same split operation, provided you make an identical call to MclassSplitDataset() (that is, you specify the same dataset contexts and split percentage). M_SPLIT_DET_CONTEXT_DEFAULT Specifies to use a different random selection of entries from the source dataset context to establish the first and second destination dataset contexts, for object detection. M_SPLIT_DET_CONTEXT_FIXED_SEED Specifies to use the random selection of entries that is associated to a fixed seed, for object detection. In this case, the first and second destination dataset contexts are established using the same random selection of entries from the source dataset context. This allows you to repeat the same split operation, provided you make an identical call to MclassSplitDataset() (that is, you specify the same dataset contexts and split percentage). M_SPLIT_SEG_CONTEXT_DEFAULT Specifies to use a different random selection of entries from the source dataset context to establish the first and second destination dataset contexts, for segmentation. M_SPLIT_SEG_CONTEXT_FIXED_SEED Specifies to use the random selection of entries that is associated to a fixed seed, for segmentation. In this case, the first and second destination dataset contexts are established using the same random selection of entries from the source dataset context. This allows you to repeat the same split operation, provided you make an identical call to MclassSplitDataset() (that is, you specify the same dataset contexts and split percentage). SrcDatasetContextClassId Specifies the identifier of the source dataset context. When using MclassSplitDataset() to split a dataset with anomalous entries (that is, the source dataset has classes with M_ANOMALOUS set to M_TRUE), all anomalous entries will be in the second destination dataset (DstSecondDatasetContextClassId). In this case, the Percentage parameter controls what percentage of good (non-anomalous) entries go into the first and second destination datasets. Note that datasets with anomalous entries cannot be used for training. DstFirstDatasetContextClassId Specifies the identifier of the first destination dataset context. DstSecondDatasetContextClassId Specifies the identifier of the second destination dataset context. Percentage Specifies the percentage of entries in the source dataset context that should be in the first destination dataset context. The remaining entries in the source dataset context will be in the second destination dataset context. The percentage value can range between 0.0 to 100.0, inclusive.

This requires specifying a statistics classification context, which you must have allocated using MclassAlloc() with M_STAT_ANO, M_STAT_CNN, M_STAT_DET, M_STAT_SEG, or M_STAT_TREE_ENSEMBLE. To control a statistics classification context, use MclassControl(). You can calculate statistics for specific dataset entries, using the EntryIndex or EntryKey parameters, if you are specifying M_STAT_DET, M_STAT_SEG, or pixel-level M_STAT_ANO. After calling MclassStatCalculate(), you can obtain the statistics from the result buffer, using MclassGetResultStat(). For datasets with more than 256 class definitions, using default colors will result in repeated colors. Before calling MclassStatCalculate(), the statistics classification context must be in a preprocessed state (MclassPreprocess()). To inquire this, call MclassInquire() with M_PREPROCESSED. For the most recent documentation of this function, check for an updated version of the MIL Help online at zebra.com/aurora-imaging-library-help. Parameters Parameters StatContextClassId Specifies the identifier of a statistics classification context. This context must have been previously allocated on the required system using MclassAlloc() with M_STAT_ANO, M_STAT_CNN, M_STAT_DET, M_STAT_SEG, or M_STAT_TREE_ENSEMBLE. DatasetContextClassId Specifies the identifier of the images or features dataset on which to calculate statistics. These contexts are allocated using MclassAlloc() with M_DATASET_IMAGES or M_DATASET_FEATURES. Note that M_STAT_ANO, M_STAT_CNN, M_STAT_DET, M_STAT_SEG require an images dataset, and M_STAT_TREE_ENSEMBLE requires a feature dataset. EntryIndex Specifies the index of the dataset entry for which to calculate statistic results. This is only possible when using M_STAT_DET, M_STAT_SEG, and when calculating pixel level statistics for M_STAT_ANO. When you specify an index with EntryIndex, you must set the EntryKey parameter to M_DEFAULT_KEY. Note that both EntryIndex and EntryKey cannot be set to M_DEFAULT and M_DEFAULT_KEY simultaneously. For specifying the index of an entry Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the index of an entry is not required. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the index of an entry. EntryKey Specifies the key (MIL_UUID) of the entry for which to calculate statistic results. This is only possible when using M_STAT_DET, M_STAT_SEG, and when calculating pixel level statistics for M_STAT_ANO. When you specify an entry key with EntryKey, you must set the EntryIndex parameter to M_DEFAULT. Note that both EntryIndex and EntryKey cannot be set to M_DEFAULT and M_DEFAULT_KEY simultaneously. For specifying the unique key of an entry Value Description M_DEFAULT_KEY Specifies that the unique key of an entry is not required. Value Specifies the unique key of an entry. StatResultClassId Specifies the identifier of the statistics classification result buffer in which to write the results of the statistics calculation. The statistics classification result buffer must have been previously allocated on the required system using MclassAllocResult() with M_STAT_ANO_RESULT, M_STAT_CNN_RESULT, M_STAT_DET_RESULT, M_STAT_SEG_RESULT, or M_STAT_TREE_ENSEMBLE_RESULT. The task related to the statistics result buffer (StatResultClassId) and the statistics classification context ( StatContextClassId) must be the same.

All of the context settings that were in effect when the context was saved will be restored. A loaded or restored context is not preprocessed. This function can also save the context to a file or memory stream. All information about the previously allocated context is saved. Preprocessing changes are not saved. To inquire the number of bytes necessary to save the context to memory stream, first call MclassStream() with M_INQUIRE_SIZE_BYTE. The content saved to memory stream is equivalent to the content saved to file. In addition, any file saved using this function is equivalent to a file saved with MclassSave(). You can use this and other MIL stream functions, for example, to save all required MIL objects, as well as any other custom data, for your application to a memory stream. Once in a memory stream, you can write the stream to a single file or transfer it over a network. You are responsible for concatenating the streams and for saving the stream to file. Parameters Parameters MemPtrOrFileName Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): MIL_TEXT_PTR [optionally, in C++: a reference to a MIL_STRING] Optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector of type MIL_UINT8 Specifies the file or memory stream.

To specify a context file on a remote computer (under Distributed MIL), prefix the specified file name string with \"remote:///\" (for example, \"remote:///C:\\mydirectory\\WePutTheArtInArtificialIntelligence.mclass\"). MemPtr Specifies the address of the block of memory, when the StreamType parameter is set to M_MEMORY. The block of memory should be of type MIL_UINT8. The specified address must correspond to the first memory address in which the object is located, and the block of memory must contain the entire object. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler), you must cast the MIL_UINT8 pointer to a MIL_TEXT_PTR. SysId Specifies the system on which to allocate the classification context. M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). Version This parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. ContextClassIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the identifier of the classification context. If the operation is not successful, M_NULL is returned. M_SAVE Saves the context to a specified file or memory stream. MemPtrOrFileName Specifies the file or memory stream. M_INTERACTIVE [This is only applicable to Windows] Opens a dialog box from which you can interactively specify the drive, directory, and name of the context file, when the StreamType parameter is set to M_FILE. MIL_TEXT(\"FileName\") 1 Specifies the drive, directory, and name of the context file (for example, \"C:\\mydirectory\\WePutTheArtInArtificialIntelligence.mclass\"), when the StreamType parameter is set to M_FILE. The function handles (internally) the opening and closing of the file. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. Classifier context, training context, and data preparation files should have an MCLASS extension. Dataset context files should have an MCLASSD extension. To specify a context file on a remote computer (under Distributed MIL), prefix the specified file name string with \"remote:///\" (for example, \"remote:///C:\\mydirectory\\WePutTheArtInArtificialIntelligence.mclass\"). MemPtr Specifies the address of the block of memory, when the StreamType parameter is set to M_MEMORY. The block of memory should be of type MIL_UINT8. The specified address must correspond to the first memory address in which to write, and the block of memory must be large enough to stream the entire object. To determine the required size, call this function with M_INQUIRE_SIZE_BYTE. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler), you must cast the MIL_UINT8 pointer to a MIL_TEXT_PTR. SysId This parameter must be set to M_NULL. Version Specifies the MIL version with which the classification context must be compatible when saved. M_DEFAULT Specifies the current version of MIL.

Syntax void MclassTrain( MIL_ID&nbsp;TrainContextClassId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;ClassifierContextClassId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;TrainDatasetContextClassId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DevDatasetContextClassId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;TrainResultClassId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function trains a classifier context. This context gets trained according to a training context and dataset contexts. All training results are stored in a classification result buffer. To get these results, use MclassGetResult(). You can also copy dataset-specific training results from the result buffer to a dataset, using MclassCopyResult(). If you are using an images dataset, dataset-specific results are retrievable directly from that dataset, using MclassGetResultEntry(). To modify training related settings, call MclassControl(). To hook functions to training events, call MclassHookFunction(). A training context must be preprocessed before it is trained. To inquire a context's preprocessing state, call MclassInquire() with M_PREPROCESSED. You can train a predefined CNN, object detection, segmentation, anomaly detection classifier context, or a tree ensemble classifier context (ClassifierContextClassId). All other training contexts (TrainContextClassId, TrainDatasetContextClassId, and DevDatasetContextClassId) must be for the same type of classifier. Unless otherwise specified, contexts must have been previously allocated on the required system using MclassAlloc(). A classifier context is not trained when you allocate it. You must call MclassTrain() to train it, using the ClassifierContextClassId parameter. If you set this parameter to M_NULL, MclassTrain() automatically selects a new classifier context to train. You can also call this function to retrain a trained classifier context. To do so, you must copy the trained classifier context result that MclassTrain() produces (TrainResultClassId) into a classifier context, using MclassCopyResult(). You can then train that classifier context with MclassTrain(). Before training a trained classifier context, you should modify your training settings. You can repeat this process (train, copy result, modify settings, train) as many times as required. Note, this is not possible for object detection. When your classifier context is properly trained, you can copy the result that MclassTrain() produces into a classifier context (MclassCopyResult()) and use that trained classifier context with MclassPredict(). The training process for image classification, object detection, segmentation, and anomaly detection requires two images datasets (M_DATASET_IMAGES): a training dataset and a development dataset. You can however specify just one dataset, using the TrainDatasetContextClassId parameter, and set the development dataset parameter (DevDatasetContextClassId) to M_NULL. In this case, MIL automatically splits your specified dataset into the training and development datasets, according to the related split control settings (for example, M_SPLIT_PERCENTAGE and M_SPLIT_SEED_MODE). At this time, if data preparation controls were set, MIL prepares the datasets using an internal data preparation context. To inquire the identifier of this internal data preparation context, or the location at which prepared images are stored, use M_PREPARE_DATA_CONTEXT_ID and M_TRAIN_DESTINATION_FOLDER. Note that signed images and anomaly detection tasks are not supported for single dataset training since, MclassPrepareData() does not support preparing signed images. When training for feature classification, the development dataset is optional; typically, only the training dataset is used. In this case, if you specify one dataset, using the TrainDatasetContextClassId parameter, and you set the DevDatasetContextClassId parameter to M_NULL, MIL does not train with a development dataset (your data is not split), and the development dataset results will not be available (such as M_DEV_DATASET_ACCURACY). For feature classification, you must explicitly specify the identifier of the development dataset to use it (DevDatasetContextClassId). Training time can vary considerably, depending on the complexity of the application, the available hardware, and the accuracy required. To produce a properly trained classifier, MclassTrain() might have to run for an extended period, and you might have to call it several times after modifying your training setup (for example, your training settings or your datasets). To take advantage of all available resources, such as GPU training, you should install the required MIL X Service Pack add-on. For more information, see the MIL add-ons and updates subsection of the Requirements, recommendations, and troubleshooting section of Chapter 47: Machine learning with the MIL Classification module. Parameters Parameters TrainContextClassId Specifies the identifier of the training context with which to train the classifier context. Training settings (MclassControl()) are held in the training context. ClassifierContextClassId Specifies the identifier of the classifier context to train. Depending on this parameter's setting, you can start a new training process, or continue a training process. To start a new training process, you can set this parameter to M_NULL. In this case, MIL automatically selects the classifier to train (ClassifierContextClassId) according to the specified training context (TrainContextClassId). For an image classification training context (M_TRAIN_CNN), MIL selects a predefined medium ICNet classifier (M_ICNET_M). For an object detection training context (M_TRAIN_DET), MIL selects an object detection classifier (M_ODNET). For a segmentation training context (M_TRAIN_SEG), MIL selects a predefined medium CSNet classifier (M_CSNET_M). For an anomaly detection training context (M_TRAIN_ANO), MIL selects a predefined ADNet classifier (M_ADNET). For a feature classification training context (M_TRAIN_TREE_ENSEMBLE), MIL selects a tree ensemble classifier (M_CLASSIFIER_TREE_ENSEMBLE). To start a new training process for image classification (M_TRAIN_CNN), object detection (M_TRAIN_DET), segmentation (M_TRAIN_SEG), or anomaly detection (M_TRAIN_ANO), and override the training context that MIL automatically selects when you specify M_NULL, set this parameter to the identifier of an original (untrained) classifier context that was predefined by Matrox. To continue the training process, set this parameter to the identifier of a trained classifier context. Note, this is not possible for object detection. When you call MclassTrain(), the class definitions in the classifier context are discarded and replaced by the class definitions in the training dataset context. By default, MclassTrain() uses the default train engine established by the MILConfig utility. You can modify this by calling MclassControl() with M_TRAIN_ENGINE or in MILConfig. TrainDatasetContextClassId Specifies the identifier of the training dataset context with which to train the classifier context. If training with an image classification (M_TRAIN_CNN), object detection (M_TRAIN_DET), segmentation (M_TRAIN_SEG), or anomaly detection (M_TRAIN_ANO) training context (TrainContextClassId), and you set the DevDatasetContextClassId parameter to M_NULL, the specified dataset (TrainDatasetContextClassId) is split into the training dataset and the development dataset. You can set both the TrainDatasetContextClassId and the DevDatasetContextClassId parameters to M_NULL if there are valid training and development datasets in your training results (TrainResultClassId); in this case, those datasets are used. This is meant for quickly testing different training settings with those same datasets (this is faster since those datasets are already split and prepared). DevDatasetContextClassId Specifies the identifier of the development dataset context with which to evaluate the performance of the classifier context's training. If not needed, set this parameter to M_NULL. If you explicitly provide the development dataset, ensure that it does not contain data (image or feature entries) that is in the training dataset, and that it does not contain augmented data. You can set both the DevDatasetContextClassId and the TrainDatasetContextClassId parameters to M_NULL if there are valid training and development datasets in your training results (TrainResultClassId); in this case, those datasets are used. This is meant for quickly testing different training settings with those same datasets (this is faster since those datasets are already split and prepared). TrainResultClassId Specifies the identifier of the classification result buffer in which to write the results of the training operation. This result buffer must have been previously allocated on the required system using MclassAllocResult() with M_TRAIN_CNN_RESULT, M_TRAIN_DET_RESULT, M_TRAIN_SEG_RESULT, M_TRAIN_ANO_RESULT, or M_TRAIN_TREE_ENSEMBLE_RESULT.

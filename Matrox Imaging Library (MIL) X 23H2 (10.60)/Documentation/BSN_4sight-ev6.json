      "text": " Using Matrox 4Sight EV6 with MIL MIL treats Matrox 4Sight EV6 as a normal computer. To use the processing power or to use the capabilities of the auxiliary I/O interface (auxiliary signals) of Matrox 4Sight EV6, allocate a Host system using MsysAlloc() with M_SYSTEM_HOST. Matrox 4Sight EV6 allows you to use either GigE Vision-compliant cameras or USB3 Vision-compliant cameras directly connected to the unit. Camera type System name For more information MIL system-specific information (MIL Reference) GigE Vision M_SYSTEM_GIGE_VISION See the Matrox GigE Vision driver chapter in the MIL Hardware-specific Notes, Matrox GigE Vision driver release notes. GigE Vision USB3 Vision M_SYSTEM_USB3_VISION See the Matrox USB3 Vision driver chapter in the MIL Hardware-specific Notes, Matrox USB3 Vision release notes. USB3 Vision Matrox 4Sight EV6 comes with the Windows 10 IoT enterprise operating system preinstalled, and a runtime license for both MIL and DA, or just MIL (depending on your model). The runtime license includes the industrial and robot communication module. This might change over time; contact your Matrox representative for more information. This license also allows for Distributed MIL configurations. Note that when installing a redistribution (runtime) version of MIL on Matrox 4Sight EV6, the license number will be based on the hardware fingerprint of your unit. This means that you will not be able to copy the licensed version of MIL to another computer. Using the Advanced I/O Engine of Matrox 4Sight EV6 Matrox 4Sight EV6 has an Advanced I/O Engine that controls the auxiliary I/O interface. The engine includes 16 timers, 2 quadrature decoders, 2 I/O command lists, 8 auxiliary output signals, and 8 auxiliary input signals. To route auxiliary I/O signals and configure interrupts, use MsysControl(). To inquire this information, use MsysInquire(). For more information on some of these features, refer to Chapter 56: I/O signals and communicating with external devices. Using EtherNet/IP, Modbus, or PROFINET You can use the Gigabit Ethernet ports for communication with external devices using the EtherNet/IP, Modbus (over TCP/IP), or PROFINET industrial protocol. For PROFINET support, you must use the port with access to the Matrox PROFINET Engine (LAN 2); the interface of this engine is recognized as a second network device with its own IP and MAC settings (when the PROFINET service is enabled) even though it shares the same LAN connection. By default PROFINET is disabled, but to enable it go to MILConfig, select the Communication tab, then chose PROFINET and set it to enabled. For more information, see the Steps to perform industrial communication section of Chapter 57: Industrial communication.

      "text": " Using timers and rotary decoders with Matrox 4Sight EV6 Matrox 4Sight EV6 has 16 timers and 2 quadrature decoders that can be used to synchronize with external devices. Timers are used with I/O signals to coordinate events with external devices. Quadrature decoders are used to decode quadrature input (2-bit Gray code derived from two signals) from a quadrature encoder. Timers The 16 timers on Matrox 4Sight EV6 can be configured using MsysControl(). The timers are configured in a similar way to what is described in the Timers and coordinating events section of Chapter 56: I/O signals and communicating with external devices. There are some differences, however, such as: A timer arming mechanism can be configured and enabled for each timer. If timer arming is enabled, the timer will ignore its trigger signal (MsysControl() with M_TIMER_TRIGGER_SOURCE) until a signal transition, specified using MsysControl() with M_TIMER_ARM_ACTIVATION, occurs on the signal specified using MsysControl() with M_TIMER_ARM_SOURCE. To enable timer arming, use MsysControl() with M_TIMER_ARM. The clock source can be specified for both the delay portion and duration portion of the timer output signal. For example, a rotary decoder output signal can be used to set the delay between the timer trigger and the active portion of the timer's output signal, and the unit's clock generator can be used to set the duration of the active portion of the timer's output signal. The timer can measure the duration of a pulse on a signal. To enable this functionality, use MsysControl() with M_TIMER_USAGE set to M_PULSE_MEASUREMENT. When a timer is set in this mode, the duration of pulses that occur on the timer's trigger source (M_TIMER_TRIGGER_SOURCE) are measured with respect to the clock source for the active portion of the timer (M_TIMER_CLOCK_SOURCE). To measure active-high pulses, set M_TIMER_TRIGGER_ACTIVATION to M_LEVEL_HIGH; to measure active-low pulses, set M_TIMER_TRIGGER_ACTIVATION to M_LEVEL_LOW. The measured value can be inquired using MsysInquire() with M_TIMER_VALUE. Note that when in this mode, the timer's output always remains low, and the values set using M_TIMER_DELAY_CLOCK_SOURCE, M_TIMER_DELAY, and M_TIMER_DURATION are ignored. Quadrature decoders The two quadrature decoders on Matrox 4Sight EV6 can be configured using MsysControl() with M_ROTARY_ENCODER_.... The quadrature decoders are configured in a similar way to what is described in the Using quadrature input from a rotary encoder section of Chapter 56: I/O signals and communicating with external devices. However, the following settings are unavailable when using Matrox 4Sight EV6: setting the direction of movement (M_ROTARY_ENCODER_DIRECTION), setting a signal source that changes the rotary decoder counter value (M_ROTARY_ENCODER_FORCE_VALUE_SOURCE), setting whether to enable the rotary decoder to store the counter value at the end of the last grab or frame interrupt (M_ROTARY_ENCODER_FRAME_END_READ), and setting a multiplying factor to each increment/decrement of the rotary decoder counter (M_ROTARY_ENCODER_MULTIPLIER). There are two data latches associated with the rotary decoders on Matrox 4sight EV6. You can store the counter value of a rotary decoder in either of these data latches whenever a signal is received from a timer or auxiliary I/O, using MsysControl() with settings from the table For controlling the settings of a data latch associated with rotary encoders. You can retrieve the stored value within a hook function (hooked using MsysHookFunction()) using MsysGetHookInfo() with M_SYS_DATA_LATCH_VALUE. Note that the function must be hooked to the same type of event that triggers the latch. For example, if the latch is triggered by a timer (M_SYS_DATA_LATCH_TRIGGER_SOURCE with M_TIMERn), the hook function must be hooked to a timer event (M_TIMER_START or M_TIMER_END).

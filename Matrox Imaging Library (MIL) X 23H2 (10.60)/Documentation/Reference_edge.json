  "text": " Medge functions Synopsis The functions prefixed with Medge make up the Edge Finder module. The Edge Finder module provides powerful operations that allow you to extract different types of edges in images, such as object contours or thin curvilinear shapes. The module offers many settings including image processing controls, feature controls, and annotations controls. It also provides analysis capabilities allowing for the advanced manipulations of results. The Edge Finder module can also be used in conjunction with the MIL Geometric Model Finder module; that is, you can define models from the result of an edge extraction, or you can find occurrences in the result of an edge extraction. The Edge Finder module offers complete support for camera calibration. Extraction of edges can be performed in the calibrated real-world such that, even without physically correcting your images, results are in real-world units.

Syntax MIL_ID MedgeAlloc( MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;EdgeFinderType, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*ContextIdPtr //out ) Description This function allocates an Edge Finder context on the specified system. An Edge Finder context contains all the information necessary to perform an MedgeCalculate() operation, including global processing settings, and edge features to calculate. Edge Finder context settings can be adjusted using MedgeControl(). When the Edge Finder context is no longer required, release it using MedgeFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during allocation; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the Edge Finder context's lifetime and you must not manually free it. Parameters Parameters SysId Specifies the system on which to allocate the Edge Finder context. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the system Value Description M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). EdgeFinderType Specifies the type of Edge Finder context. This parameter must be set to one of the values below. For the Edge Finder context Value Description M_CONTOUR Specifies a contour context type, which is used to find object contours in images. M_CREST Specifies a crest context type, which is used to find thin line crests in images. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT.

Syntax void MedgeCalculate( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SourceImageId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SourceDeriv1Id, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SourceDeriv2Id, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SourceDeriv3Id, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;EdgeResultId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function extracts edges and calculates edge features in the source image buffer or in the derivative image buffers. You can also use this function to perform post-calculations on included edges of an Edge Finder result buffer. Results are stored in the specified Edge Finder result buffer. Select which edge features to calculate with MedgeControl(). Include, exclude, or delete edges that meet a specified criterion with MedgeSelect(). Note that to calculate new features and/or select features of a new set of edges, MedgeCalculate() must be called after MedgeControl() and/or MedgeSelect(). If the source image or derivative images are calibrated, results are calculated in the world coordinate system, otherwise they are calculated in the pixel coordinate system. If the source image or derivative images are calibrated, you can retrieve results in real-world or in pixel units. However, in the presence of distortion, some results are meaningless when converted from real-world to pixel units (for example, Feret angles). For example, if an edge appears warped in the source image, but the camera calibration context of the source image compensates for this during the extraction, the resulting Feret angles are meaningful in the real-world coordinate system, and meaningless in the pixel coordinate system. Calculations are typically done on a source image buffer (SourceImageId), where MedgeCalculate() calculates the required derivative image buffers that are used to extract edges. In this case, the derivative image buffers (SourceDeriv1Id, SourceDeriv2Id, and SourceDeriv3Id) must be set to M_NULL. However, if you specify your own derivative image buffers, the edge extraction process is done with them instead. In this case, SourceImageId must be set to M_NULL. Note that, when specifying your own derivative image buffers, the majority of processing control settings remain in effect, except for filter settings (for example, M_FILTER_SMOOTHNESS). When calculated by Edge Finder, derivative buffers are always consistent (for example, they have the same scaling factor) and are always normalized to 10-bit images such that the maximum output value is 1024 for 8-bit source images. When you provide the derivative buffers, they should respect these limitations for best performance. To avoid repeatedly calculating time-consuming edge features for all edges in a source image, MedgeCalculate() can also perform post-calculations on included edges of an Edge Finder result buffer. That is, once the results of a calculation have been stored in an Edge Finder result buffer, you can select a subset of edges from that Edge Finder result buffer (with MedgeSelect()) and/or add new features for calculation to that Edge Finder result buffer (with MedgeControl()), and then perform the post-calculation with MedgeCalculate(). In this case, processing time greatly decreases since calculations are not unnecessarily repeated. The operation of selecting edges and adding new features can be repeated until the required result is calculated. To perform post-calculations on the included edges of an Edge Finder result buffer, set SourceImageId, SourceDeriv1Id, SourceDeriv2Id, and SourceDeriv3Id to M_NULL. Note that there are some restrictions when post-calculating edges; for more information, see the Post-calculation subsection of the Calculating and retrieving results section of Chapter 10: Edge Finder. Parameters Parameters ContextId Specifies the Edge Finder context to use for the extraction. The Edge Finder context must have been previously allocated on the required system using MedgeAlloc(). SourceImageId Specifies the source image buffer from which to extract edges. Typically, the source image buffer should be 1-band 8-bit unsigned. Other buffer depths and types are generally accepted, but can slightly decrease performance. Note that 3-band source image buffers are only supported when extracting edge contours. When the source image buffer is 32-bit float, Edge Finder uses floating-point precision calculations. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. If you specify your own derivative image buffers, or if you are performing post-calculations on the included edges of an Edge Finder result buffer, this parameter must be set to M_NULL. SourceDeriv1Id Specifies the X-source derivative image buffer used to extract edges. When the Edge Finder context type is M_CONTOUR, SourceDeriv1Id specifies the first derivative of the image in the X-direction. When the Edge Finder context type is M_CREST, SourceDeriv1Id specifies the second derivative of the image in the X-direction. Derivative image buffers must be 1-band 16-bit signed or 1-band 32-bit float. In addition, all derivative image buffers must be consistent (for example, they must have the same scaling factor), and they must be of the same type and size. When the derivative image buffers are 32-bit float, Edge Finder uses floating-point precision calculations. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. If you specify a source image buffer, or if you are performing post-calculations on the included edges of an Edge Finder result buffer, this parameter must be set to M_NULL. SourceDeriv2Id Specifies the Y-source derivative image buffer used to extract edges. When the Edge Finder context type is M_CONTOUR, SourceDeriv2Id specifies the first derivative of the image in the Y-direction. When the Edge Finder context type is M_CREST, SourceDeriv2Id specifies the second derivative of the image in the Y-direction. Derivative image buffers must be 1-band 16-bit signed or 1-band 32-bit float. In addition, all derivative image buffers must be consistent (for example, they must have the same scaling factor), and they must be of the same type and size. When the derivative image buffers are 32-bit float, Edge Finder uses floating-point precision calculations. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. If you specify a source image buffer, or if you are performing post-calculations on the included edges of an Edge Finder result buffer, this parameter must be set to M_NULL. SourceDeriv3Id Specifies the source cross-derivative image buffer used to extract edges. The cross-derivative can only be specified if the Edge Finder context type is M_CREST. If the Edge Finder context type is M_CONTOUR, set SourceDeriv3Id to M_NULL. Derivative image buffers must be 1-band 16-bit signed or 1-band 32-bit float. In addition, all derivative image buffers must be consistent (for example, they must have the same scaling factor), and they must be of the same type and size. When the derivative image buffers are 32-bit float, Edge Finder uses floating-point precision calculations. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. If you specify a source image buffer, or if you are performing post-calculations on the included edges of an Edge Finder result buffer, this parameter must be set to M_NULL. EdgeResultId Specifies the Edge Finder result buffer in which to write the results of the extraction. The Edge Finder result buffer must have been previously allocated on the required system using MedgeAllocResult(). [Matrox Solios eA/XA; Matrox Solios ecl/xcl/ev-cl] The Edge Finder result buffer (EdgeResultId) must be allocated on the same system as the Edge Finder context (ContextId). If it is not, an error will occur. ControlFlag Specifies whether optimal performance during Edge Finder calculations is ensured. This parameter can only be used when providing derivative image buffers. When providing a source image buffer, optimal performance is always ensured; therefore, this parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. When providing derivative image buffers, this parameter must be set to one of the following values: For the derivative image buffers Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that optimal performance is not ensured. M_NO_CHECK Specifies that optimal performance is ensured. M_NO_CHECK should only be used if each derivative image buffer has pixel values that do not go beyond the range of positive or negative 1024 (that is, 10-bit signed values). This ensures optimal performance since Edge Finder does not have to verify unnecessary values. Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; miledge.lib.

Syntax void MedgeControl( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextOrResultId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlType, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;ControlValue //in ) Description This function sets the specified control for either an Edge Finder context or an Edge Finder result buffer. For Edge Finder contexts, these settings control the execution of MedgeCalculate() operations and select which edge features MedgeCalculate() should calculate. For Edge Finder result buffers, these settings control the post manipulation of results. For example, to draw a zoomed region of the source image that was used to calculate results, the drawing control values must be appropriately set. Similarly, to select edges based on the proximity of an edge or edges to a specified point, M_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR_RADIUS must be appropriately set. For more information, see MedgeDraw() or MedgeSelect(). All control settings can typically be inquired with MedgeInquire(). For new context settings to take effect, you must calculate the settings, using MedgeCalculate(). Note that some control settings have post-calculation restrictions. For more information, see the Post-calculation subsection of the Calculating and retrieving results section of Chapter 10: Edge Finder. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler) in 64-bit mode, MedgeControl() internally calls the MIL_DOUBLE version of this function (MedgeControlDouble()). If you need to pass large integer values (including pointers), call the MIL_INT64 version of this function (MedgeControlInt64()). Parameters Parameters ContextOrResultId Specifies either the Edge Finder context or the Edge Finder result buffer whose settings you want to modify. The Edge Finder context or the Edge Finder result buffer must have been previously allocated on the required system using MedgeAlloc() or MedgeAllocResult(), respectively. ControlType Specifies the setting to change. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ControlValue Specifies the setting's new value. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Parameter associations The tables below list possible values for the ControlType and ControlValue parameters. For operation settings for object contours and line crests For operation settings for line crests For saving internal buffers in the Edge Finder result buffer For calculating edge features For calculating Feret values For selecting groups of edge features For performing post-calculations on extracted edges For a result buffer For setting closest-edgel constraints The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to control the Edge Finder context operation settings and can be specified for both M_CONTOUR and M_CREST Edge Finder contexts, unless otherwise specified. For operation settings for object contours and line crests ControlType Description ControlValue M_ACCURACY Sets the edgel accuracy of the edge extraction. Accuracy depends on the image's dynamic range, sharpness, and noise. The best accuracy is achieved in well-contrasted noise-free images. M_DEFAULT Same as M_HIGH. M_DISABLE Specifies that edgel accuracy will be disabled. Edgels will be calculated with pixel accuracy. M_HIGH Specifies high accuracy. Edgels will be calculated with subpixel accuracy. M_VERY_HIGH Specifies very high accuracy. Edgels will be calculated with very precise subpixel accuracy. M_VERY_HIGH uses a classical camera model to compensate for any pixel-distortion aberration. M_ANGLE_ACCURACY Sets the precision with which to estimate edgel angles when extracting edges. M_ANGLE_ACCURACY can only be used with M_CONTOUR Edge Finder contexts. M_DEFAULT Same as M_HIGH. M_HIGH Specifies high precision. The angle estimation is performed in increments of 360/256 degrees. M_LOW Specifies low precision. The angle estimation is performed in increments of 45 degrees. M_CHAIN_ALL_NEIGHBORS Sets how edge chains are built. Edge chains are built using an 8-connected lattice. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that edge chains are built with the least amount of edgel information possible. M_ENABLE Specifies that edge chains are built with as much edgel information as possible. Enabling M_CHAIN_ALL_NEIGHBORS can result in slightly longer calculations, however, the edge chain will contain more edgel information. M_DETAIL_LEVEL Sets the level of details to extract from the image. The detail level determines what is considered an edge/background. A higher detail level will include more edges than a lower detail level. Essentially, M_DETAIL_LEVEL sets the threshold mode of the Edge Finder context. Note that an M_DETAIL_LEVEL setting overrides an M_THRESHOLD_MODE setting. Typically, M_DETAIL_LEVEL is used when interfacing with the MIL Geometric Model Finder module. Otherwise, M_THRESHOLD_MODE should be used instead. M_DEFAULT Same as M_MEDIUM. M_HIGH Sets the detail level to high. M_MEDIUM Sets the detail level to medium. M_VERY_HIGH Sets the detail level to very high. M_EXTRACTION_SCALE Sets the scale of the image at which to do the edge extraction. Once the extraction is complete, the results are scaled to the original scale of the image. An extraction scale less than one speeds up the calculation or the search but can result in a less reliable result, including, the loss of important details and/or a reduction in the accuracy of the search results. M_EXTRACTION_SCALE is for advanced users of the EdgeFinder module. The default setting usually provides the most accurate search results. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the extraction scale. M_FILTER_SMOOTHNESS Sets the degree of smoothness (strength of denoising) applied by the filter during the neighborhood operation. M_FILTER_SMOOTHNESS only has an effect if MedgeControl() with M_FILTER_TYPE is set to M_DERICHE or M_SHEN. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 50.0. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the smoothness value. A value of 100.0 results in a strong noise reduction effect, while a value of 0.0 has almost no noise reduction effect. M_FILTER_TYPE Sets the type of filter used when performing the neighborhood operation used to extract edges. The type of filter determines the distribution of the neighborhoods' influence. M_DEFAULT Same as M_SHEN. M_DERICHE Specifies a Deriche infinite support filter. This is an exponential weighting function, of the general form: Deriche is an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter. For the Deriche filter, the neighborhoods' influence decreases much slower as the distance from the central pixel increases, compared to the Shen-Castan filter (M_SHEN). M_DERICHE can be used with both M_CONTOUR and M_CREST Edge Finder contexts. Typically, M_DERICHE is used for unusually thick crests. M_DERICHE allows you to use Edge Finder's smoothing capabilities. To do so, use MedgeControl() with M_FILTER_SMOOTHNESS. M_FREI_CHEN Specifies a Frei Chen filter. This is a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter that can be represented with the following convolution kernels: M_FREI_CHEN can only be used with M_CONTOUR Edge Finder contexts. Also, when using M_FREI_CHEN, you cannot smooth images using MedgeControl() with M_FILTER_SMOOTHNESS. M_PREWITT Specifies a Prewitt filter. This is a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter that can be represented with the following convolution kernels: M_PREWITT can only be used with M_CONTOUR Edge Finder contexts. Also, when using M_PREWITT, you cannot smooth images using MedgeControl() with M_FILTER_SMOOTHNESS. M_SHEN Specifies a Shen-Castan infinite support exponential filter. This is an exponential weighting function, of the general form: Shen-Castan is an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter. For the Shen-Castan filter, the neighborhoods' influence decreases much faster as the distance from the central pixel increases, compared to the Deriche filter (M_DERICHE). M_SHEN can be used with both M_CONTOUR and M_CREST Edge Finder contexts. Typically, M_SHEN performs an excellent edge extraction on most images; however, if you are extracting unusually thick crests that yield inappropriate results, you should use M_DERICHE. M_SHEN allows you to use Edge Finder's smoothing capabilities. To do so, use MedgeControl() with M_FILTER_SMOOTHNESS. M_SOBEL Specifies a Sobel filter. This is a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter that can be represented with the following convolution kernels: M_SOBEL can only be used with M_CONTOUR Edge Finder contexts. Also, when using M_SOBEL, you cannot smooth images using MedgeControl() with M_FILTER_SMOOTHNESS. M_FLOAT_MODE Sets whether to force all the processing of edge extraction operations to be performed using floating-point precision calculations. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that all edge extractions are not forced to be performed using floating-point precision calculations. M_ENABLE Specifies that all edge extractions are forced to be performed using floating-point precision calculations. M_MAGNITUDE_TYPE Sets how to calculate the magnitude of the edge at each edgel position. Note that for M_CONTOUR Edge Finder contexts, the magnitude is the norm of the gradient vector at the edgel position. For M_CREST Edge Finder contexts, the magnitude is equal to the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix at the edgel position. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value. For M_CONTOUR Edge Finder contexts, the default is M_SQR_NORM. For M_CREST Edge Finder contexts, the default is M_NORM. M_NORM Specifies that the magnitude will be used. M_SQR_NORM Specifies that the square of the magnitude will be used. This value optimizes the edge extraction operation while still preserving a very good edgel position accuracy. M_SQR_NORM is calculated faster than M_NORM, though it is less accurate. M_OVERSCAN Sets the type of overscan used to handle the source image's bordering pixels. Note that M_OVERSCAN is ignored if using an IIR filter (e.g. Shen and Deriche filter types). M_DEFAULT Same as M_MIRROR. M_DISABLE Specifies that no overscan will be used, unless processing the border pixels is faster than ignoring them; in the latter case, MIL automatically selects the overscan to optimize speed according to the specified operation and the target system. M_MIRROR Specifies that the border pixels of a source image are processed using overscan pixel values that mirror the source buffer pixel values. That is, the overscan pixel values will be a mirror copy of the source buffer's borders. For example: M_REPLACE Specifies that the border pixels of a source image are processed using overscan pixel values set to the overscan replacement value (MedgeControl() with M_OVERSCAN_REPLACE_VALUE). M_TRANSPARENT Specifies that the border pixels of a source image are processed using transparent overscan pixel values. That is, the overscan pixel values will be those of the parent buffer. If they are not available, a mirror type overscan is used instead. M_OVERSCAN_REPLACE_VALUE Sets a replacement value for the overscan pixel values. Note that M_OVERSCAN_REPLACE_VALUE is ignored unless M_OVERSCAN with MedgeControl() is set to M_REPLACE. In addition, M_OVERSCAN_REPLACE_VALUE is ignored if using an IIR filter (e.g. Shen and Deriche filter types). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. M_REPLACE_MAX Specifies that the overscan neighborhood pixel values will be set to the maximum value of the source image buffer. M_REPLACE_MIN Specifies that the overscan neighborhood pixel values will be set to the minimum value of the source image buffer. Value Specifies the value of the overscan neighborhood pixels. M_THRESHOLD_HIGH Sets the upper bound of the hysteresis threshold value. M_THRESHOLD_HIGH is ignored unless MedgeControl() with M_THRESHOLD_MODE is set to M_USER_DEFINED. Note that lower threshold values result in a more sensitive edgel detection; that is, a higher (or equal) number of edgels are detected. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the upper bound of the hysteresis threshold. M_THRESHOLD_LOW Sets the lower bound of the hysteresis threshold value. M_THRESHOLD_LOW is ignored unless MedgeControl() with M_THRESHOLD_MODE is set to M_USER_DEFINED. Note that lower threshold values result in a more sensitive edgel detection; that is, a higher (or equal) number of edgels are detected. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the lower bound of the hysteresis threshold. M_THRESHOLD_MODE Sets the threshold of the edge extraction. The Edge Finder module uses a classical hysteresis threshold to extract relevant edges in the image. Threshold values can either be set manually or determined automatically by the Edge Finder module. Note that lower threshold values result in a more sensitive edgel detection; that is, a higher (or equal) number of edgels are detected. When interfacing with the MIL Geometric Model Finder module, you should use M_DETAIL_LEVEL to set the threshold mode. Note that an M_DETAIL_LEVEL setting overrides an M_THRESHOLD_MODE setting. M_DEFAULT Same as M_HIGH. M_DISABLE Specifies no threshold. All edges are extracted. M_HIGH Specifies a high threshold. M_HIGH should be used for images with some contrast variations, noise, and non-uniform illumination. M_HIGH always results in a lower (or equal) number of edgels than M_MEDIUM. M_LOW Specifies a low threshold. All edges over a minimum noise-based estimated threshold are extracted. M_LOW always results in a lower (or equal) number of edgels than M_DISABLE. M_MEDIUM Specifies a medium threshold. M_MEDIUM should be used for multi-contrast images, or for images with a lot of noise or non-uniform illumination. M_MEDIUM always results in a lower (or equal) number of edgels than M_LOW. M_USER_DEFINED Specifies that the threshold values will be user-defined. Set the threshold values with M_THRESHOLD_LOW and M_THRESHOLD_HIGH. M_VERY_HIGH Specifies a very high threshold. Only the strongest edges in the image are extracted. M_VERY_HIGH always results in a lower (or equal) number of edgels than M_HIGH. M_THRESHOLD_TYPE Sets the type of hysteresis threshold used when performing the edge extraction. Edge chains are built such that the magnitude values of all connected edgels are stronger than a lower bound threshold value and such that at least one of the edgel's magnitude in each edge chain is stronger than a upper bound threshold value. Note that M_THRESHOLD_TYPE sets how to use the lower and upper threshold bounds, while M_THRESHOLD_MODE defines what the bounds are. M_DEFAULT Same as M_HYSTERESIS. M_FULL_HYSTERESIS Specifies that the lower bound threshold value is 0. M_HYSTERESIS Specifies that both the lower bound threshold value and the upper bound threshold value will be used. M_NO_HYSTERESIS Specifies that the lower bound threshold value is equal to the upper bound threshold value. M_TIMEOUT Sets the maximum edge extraction and calculation time for MedgeCalculate(), in msec. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies an infinite amount of edge extraction and calculation time. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the maximum edge extraction and calculation time, in msec.

Typically, you would set M_FILL_GAP_DISTANCE to a value in the range of 2 to 5 pixels. M_FILL_GAP_POLARITY Sets the use of the edge polarity to perform the filling of edge gaps. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ANY. M_ANY Specifies that gaps between edges will be filled, regardless of their polarity. M_REVERSE Specifies that gaps between edges that have reverse polarity will be filled. Note that M_REVERSE is not available for M_CREST Edge Finder contexts. M_SAME Specifies that gaps between edges that have the same polarity will be filled. Note that M_SAME is not available for M_CREST Edge Finder contexts. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be specified for an Edge Finder result buffer. For a result buffer ControlType Description ControlValue M_AGM_COMPATIBLE Sets whether the Edge Finder result buffer can be used with an AGM context. When used together, you can define models from the result of an edge extraction, or you can find model occurrences in the result of an edge extraction. Note that you must call MedgeCalculate() for this setting to take effect. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that the Edge Finder result buffer cannot be used with an AGM context. M_ENABLE Specifies that the Edge Finder result buffer can be used with an AGM context. M_DRAW_CROSS_SIZE Sets the size of the cross used to identify certain features when drawing with MedgeDraw(). This cross is used to draw the edge's edgels (M_DRAW_EDGELS), mid-point (M_DRAW_POSITION), and center of gravity (M_DRAW_CENTER_OF_GRAVITY). For more information, see MedgeDraw(). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 4.0 pixels. Value Specifies the size of the cross, in pixels. M_MODEL_FINDER_COMPATIBLE Sets whether the Edge Finder result buffer can be used with a Model Finder context. When used together, you can define models from the result of an edge extraction, or you can find model occurrences in the result of an edge extraction. Note that you must call MedgeCalculate() for this setting to take effect. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that the Edge Finder result buffer cannot be used with a Model Finder context. M_ENABLE Specifies that the Edge Finder result buffer can be used with a Model Finder context. M_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR_RADIUS Sets the radius distance used to select the closest edge or edges from a point. For more information, see the MedgeSelect() Condition parameter values M_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR and M_ALL_NEAREST_NEIGHBORS. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 2.0 pixels. Value Specifies the radius distance, in pixels. M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS Sets whether to return results in pixels or world units. This essentially sets the output coordinate system to use. The setting of this control type will only affect functions within this module which return positional results. This control type can be changed at any time to return results in the required output units. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ACCORDING_TO_CALIBRATION. M_ACCORDING_TO_CALIBRATION Specifies that results are returned in world units if the result was calculated on an image associated with a camera calibration context; otherwise, specifies that results are returned in pixel units. M_PIXEL Specifies that results are returned in pixel units, with respect to the pixel coordinate system. M_WORLD Specifies that results are returned in world units, with respect to the relative coordinate system. If world units are specifed, calling MedgeGetResult() or MedgeGetNeighbors() generates an error if the result was not calculated on a calibrated image. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to set closest-edgel constraints for MedgeGetNeighbors(). This function retrieves the coordinates of edgels, from an Edge Finder result buffer, that meet the constraints set below, and correspond to the closest neighbors from a list of user-specified source points. The following values can only be specified for an Edge Finder result buffer. For setting closest-edgel constraints ControlType Description ControlValue M_NEIGHBOR_ANGLE Sets the gradient angle that an edgel must have, before being considered a candidate, when finding the closest edgels to a list of points. M_NEIGHBOR_ANGLE is based on a source angle, which you must provide for each source point, with MedgeGetNeighbors(). Note that you can set a tolerance for this angle, using MedgeControl() with M_NEIGHBOR_ANGLE_TOLERANCE. M_NEIGHBOR_ANGLE can only be used if the internal angle buffer (MedgeControl() with M_SAVE_ANGLE) was initially saved. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ANY. M_ANY Specifies that the edgel candidate can have any gradient angle. Note that M_ANY is equivalent to setting M_NEIGHBOR_ANGLE_TOLERANCE to 360.0. In this case, you need not provide the source angle(s) in MedgeGetNeighbors(). M_REVERSE Specifies that the gradient angle of the edgel candidate must have the reverse angle (+ 180) of the source point. M_SAME Specifies that the gradient angle of the edgel candidate must have the same angle as the source point. M_SAME_OR_REVERSE Specifies that the gradient angle of the edgel candidate must either have the same, or the reverse angle of the source point. M_NEIGHBOR_ANGLE_TOLERANCE Sets the angular tolerance to use for the angle constraint (M_NEIGHBOR_ANGLE), when finding the closest edgels to a list of points. Only edgels that have a gradient angle that falls within this angular range can be returned. Note that M_NEIGHBOR_ANGLE_TOLERANCE is ignored if M_NEIGHBOR_ANGLE is set to M_ANY. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 180.0. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 360.0 Specifies the angular tolerance, in degrees. This value is applied to the angle constraint. Note that setting M_NEIGHBOR_ANGLE_TOLERANCE to 360.0 is equivalent to setting M_NEIGHBOR_ANGLE to M_ANY. M_NEIGHBOR_MAXIMUM_NUMBER Sets the maximum number of edgels that can be returned (for each point), when finding the closest edgels to a list of points. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1. Value Specifies the maximum number of edgels. M_NEIGHBOR_MINIMUM_SPACING Sets the minimum distance separating closest edgel candidates within the same edge, when finding the closest edgels to a list of points. M_DEFAULT Same as M_INFINITE. M_INFINITE Specifies no minimum distance separating two edgel candidates. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the minimum distance, in edgels. M_SEARCH_ANGLE Sets the search angle constraint (applied the Edge Finder result buffer), when finding the closest edgels to a list of points. Only edgels that are located along this angle can be returned. M_SEARCH_ANGLE is relative to the source angle set with MedgeGetNeighbors(). Note that you can set the angular tolerance and the angular orientation for M_SEARCH_ANGLE, using MedgeControl() with M_SEARCH_ANGLE_TOLERANCE and M_SEARCH_ANGLE_SIGN, respectively. M_SEARCH_ANGLE, M_SEARCH_ANGLE_TOLERANCE, and M_SEARCH_ANGLE_SIGN limit the search region for potential edgel candidates to an angular sector within the Edge Finder result buffer. Only edgels that are located within this region can be returned. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 360.0 Specifies the angle, in degrees. M_SEARCH_ANGLE_SIGN Sets the orientation to use for the search angle constraint, when finding the closest edgels to a list of points. The orientation is relative to the source angle set with MedgeGetNeighbors(). For example, if the source angle is 45, then the reverse orientation would be 225. Note that you can set the search angle and the angular tolerance for M_SEARCH_ANGLE_SIGN, using MedgeControl() with M_SEARCH_ANGLE and M_SEARCH_ANGLE_TOLERANCE, respectively. M_SEARCH_ANGLE, M_SEARCH_ANGLE_TOLERANCE, and M_SEARCH_ANGLE_SIGN limit the search region for potential edgel candidates to an angular sector within the Edge Finder result buffer. Only edgels that are located within this region can be returned. M_DEFAULT Same as M_SAME. M_REVERSE Specifies that the orientation of the angle must be the reverse (+ 180) of the source angle. That is, the angle used will look flipped when compared to the source angle. M_SAME Specifies that the orientation of the angle must be the same as the source angle. M_SAME_OR_REVERSE Specifies that the orientation of the angle can be the same as, or the reverse of, the source angle. M_SEARCH_ANGLE_TOLERANCE Sets the angular tolerance to use for the search angle constraint, when finding the closest edgels to a list of points. Only edgels that are located within this angular range (in the Edge Finder result buffer) can be returned. Note that you can set the search angle and the angular orientation for M_SEARCH_ANGLE_TOLERANCE, using MedgeControl() with M_SEARCH_ANGLE and M_SEARCH_ANGLE_SIGN, respectively. M_SEARCH_ANGLE, M_SEARCH_ANGLE_TOLERANCE, and M_SEARCH_ANGLE_SIGN limit the search region for potential edgel candidates to an angular sector within the Edge Finder result buffer. Only edgels that are located within this region can be returned. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 360.0. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 360.0 Specifies the angle, in degrees. M_SEARCH_RADIUS_MAX Sets the maximum radius distance in the Edge Finder result buffer that will be searched for the closest edgels. You must use MedgeGetNeighbors() to specify the source point from which the radius is measured. Used together, M_SEARCH_RADIUS_MAX and M_SEARCH_RADIUS_MIN define a ring-like region, in the Edge Finder result buffer, that will be used to find the closest edgels. All edgels that fall outside this ring will be ignored. M_DEFAULT Same as M_INFINITE. M_INFINITE Specifies a maximum distance radius that spans all edgels in the Edge Finder result buffer. Value Specifies the maximum distance radius, in pixels. M_SEARCH_RADIUS_MIN Sets the minimum radius distance in the Edge Finder result buffer that will be searched for the closest edgels. You must use MedgeGetNeighbors() to specify the source point from which the radius is measured. Used together, M_SEARCH_RADIUS_MAX and M_SEARCH_RADIUS_MIN define a ring-like region, in the Edge Finder result buffer, that will be used to find the closest edgels. All edgels that fall outside this ring will be ignored. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0 pixels. Value Specifies the minimum distance radius, in pixels.

Syntax void MedgeDraw( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextGraId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;ResultEdgeId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufOrListGraId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Operation, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;IndexOrLabel, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function draws specific edge results in the destination image buffer or 2D graphics list. To draw edge results, the required information must be available for the specified edge or group of edges, in the Edge Finder result buffer. To verify availability, call MedgeGetResult() with the required edge result combined with M_AVAILABLE. You can draw results and settings, obtained relative to an offset, at the top-left corner of the destination image, using MgraControl() with M_DRAW_OFFSET_X and M_DRAW_OFFSET_Y and zoom them using MgraControl() with M_DRAW_ZOOM_X and M_DRAW_ZOOM_Y. For example, you can draw a zoomed section of the edge map found in the target image at the top-left corner of the destination image. For more information, see the Drawing graphics with offset and zoom subsection of the Drawing graphics section of Chapter 26: Generating graphics. Note that if the edges are calculated using a calibrated source image, Edge Finder takes the camera calibration into account; that is, drawings might be distorted, according to the camera calibration. For example, a straight line (in the world) might be drawn as a curve. Parameters Parameters ContextGraId Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics context to use when drawing. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For specifying the 2D graphics context Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the default 2D graphics context of the current MIL application is used. Note that there is a different default 2D graphics context for each thread. MIL 2D graphics context identifier Specifies a valid 2D graphics context identifier, which you have allocated using MgraAlloc(). ResultEdgeId Specifies the identifier of the Edge Finder result buffer from which to extract the results to draw. The Edge Finder result buffer must have been previously allocated on the required system using MedgeAllocResult(). [Matrox Solios eA/XA; Matrox Solios ecl/xcl/ev-cl] The Edge Finder result buffer (ResultEdgeId) must be allocated on the same system as the 2D graphics context buffer (ContextGraId). If it is not, an error will occur. DstImageBufOrListGraId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer or 2D graphics list in which to draw. The buffer can be any valid MIL image buffer allocated using MbufAlloc...(). The 2D graphics list must be previously allocated using MgraAllocList(). By drawing into a display's overlay buffer or associating the 2D graphics list with the display, you can also annotate an image non-destructively. If specifying an image buffer, it must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. When using MedgeDraw() to draw results extracted from a calibrated source image, the destination drawing buffer need not be calibrated to the same world. MedgeDraw() draws all the requested results according to the calibrated source image. Operation Specifies the type of operation to perform. The possible Operation parameter values in the table below can be added together to draw multiple feature results at once. The following operations can draw in a destination image buffer or 2D graphics list. For specifying the type of operation to perform Value Description M_DRAW_BOX Draws a bounding box around each edge. Note that to perform this operation, the M_BOX feature in MedgeControl() must be calculated. M_DRAW_CENTER_OF_GRAVITY Draws a cross at the center of gravity of each edge. You can modify the cross size by setting MedgeControl() with M_DRAW_CROSS_SIZE to an appropriate value. Note that to perform this operation, the M_CENTER_OF_GRAVITY feature in MedgeControl() must be calculated. M_DRAW_CIRCLE_FIT Draws the circle fit of each edge. Note that to perform this operation, the M_CIRCLE_FIT feature in MedgeControl() must be calculated. M_DRAW_EDGE Draws each edge. M_DRAW_EDGELS Draws a cross at each edgel. You can modify the cross size by setting MedgeControl() with M_DRAW_CROSS_SIZE to an appropriate value. M_DRAW_ELLIPSE_FIT Draws the ellipse fit of each edge. Note that to perform this operation, the M_ELLIPSE_FIT feature in MedgeControl() must be calculated. M_DRAW_FERET_GENERAL Draws the edges' general Feret, using an H-type line (|-|). This line is drawn on contact with the edge's two extrema edgels, at the general Feret diameter's angle. Note that to perform this operation, the M_FERET_GENERAL feature in MedgeControl() must be calculated. M_DRAW_FERET_MAX Draws the edges' maximum Feret, using an H-type line (|-|). This line is drawn on contact with the edge's two extrema edgels, at the maximum Feret diameter's angle. Note that to perform this operation, the M_FERET_MAX_DIAMETER and M_FERET_MAX_ANGLE features in MedgeControl() must be calculated. M_DRAW_FERET_MIN Draws the edges' minimum Feret, using an H-type line (|-|). This line is drawn on contact with the edge's two extrema edgels, at the minimum Feret diameter's angle. Note that to perform this operation, the M_FERET_MIN_DIAMETER and M_FERET_MIN_ANGLE features in MedgeControl() must be calculated. M_DRAW_INDEX Draws each edge's index value. Note that this operation will only work for included edges. Therefore the IndexOrLabel parameter cannot be set to M_EXCLUDED_EDGES and can only be set to M_ALL_EDGES if all edges are included. M_DRAW_LABEL Draws each edge's label value. Note that to perform this operation, the M_LABEL_VALUE feature in MedgeControl() must be calculated. M_DRAW_LINE_FIT Draws the line fit of each edge.

You can modify the cross size by setting MedgeControl() with M_DRAW_CROSS_SIZE to an appropriate value. Note that to perform this operation, the M_POSITION feature in MedgeControl() must be calculated. M_DRAW_SEGMENTS Draws the segments of the edge approximation. Note that to perform this operation, edge approximations must have been previously calculated by setting MedgeControl() with M_CHAIN_APPROXIMATION to M_LINE or M_WORLD_LINE. M_DRAW_VERTICES Draws the segment intersections (or vertices) of the edge approximation. Note that to perform this operation, edge approximations must have been previously calculated by setting MedgeControl() with M_CHAIN_APPROXIMATION to M_LINE or M_WORLD_LINE.

You can also set a series of constraints that potential results must adhere to before being returned. To do so, use the appropriate settings in MedgeControl(). If your target image was associated with a camera calibration context but you want to retrieve positional and dimensional results in pixel units, use MedgeControl() with the M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS control type set to M_PIXEL. Note that if you set M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS to M_WORLD and the results were not obtained from a calibrated image, MedgeGetNeighbors() will generate an error. Additionally, if results were obtained from a calibrated source image, and you specify to retrieve results in world units, user-specified coordinates and constraints must be specified in the same world units as the coordinate system used to calculate the results. Parameters Parameters EdgeResultId Specifies the identifier of the Edge Finder result buffer from which to search for edgel candidates. SizeOfArray Specifies the number of points provided. This value represents how many user-specified point coordinates will be searched for in the Edge Finder result buffer. When using a standard vector (std::vector) overload function in C++, you can pass M_DEFAULT to this parameter and MIL will automatically determine the size based on the number of items in the vector passed to the SrcArrayXPtr, SrcArrayYPtr, SrcArrayAnglePtr, DstArrayXPtr, DstArrayYPtr, DstArrayIndexPtr, or DstArrayLabelPtr parameter. SrcArrayXPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(SizeOfArray) Specifies the address of the array containing the X-coordinate(s) of the source point(s).

Note that angle values (0 to 360) are measured counter-clockwise and must be mapped between either 0 to 255 (for contour contexts) or 0 to 127 (for crest contexts). If no value is required, set this parameter to M_NULL. DstArrayXPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(SizeOfArray) Specifies the address of the array in which the X-coordinate(s) of the edgel(s) found in the Edge Finder result buffer are to be written. If no edgels were found, ignore the information written. Note that if no edgels were found, the index (DstArrayIndexPtr) and label (DstArrayLabelPtr) of the edgels is M_NULL. The size of the array must be equal to SizeOfArray multiplied by the maximum number of edgel candidates for each point (M_NEIGHBOR_MAXIMUM_NUMBER). If no value is required, set this parameter to M_NULL. DstArrayYPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(SizeOfArray) Specifies the address of the array in which the Y-coordinate(s) of the edgel(s) found in the Edge Finder result buffer is to be written. If no edgels were found, ignore the information written. Note that if no edgels were found, the index (DstArrayIndexPtr) and label (DstArrayLabelPtr) of the edgels is M_NULL. The size of the array must be equal to SizeOfArray multiplied by the maximum number of edgel candidates for each point (M_NEIGHBOR_MAXIMUM_NUMBER). If no value is required, set this parameter to M_NULL. DstArrayIndexPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(SizeOfArray) Specifies the address of the array in which the index of the edgel(s) found in the Edge Finder result buffer is to be written.

Syntax void MedgeGetResult( MIL_ID&nbsp;EdgeResultId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;EdgeIndexOrLabelValue, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ResultType, //in void&nbsp;*FirstResultArrayPtr, //out void&nbsp;*SecondResultArrayPtr //out ) Description This function retrieves the results of a specified type from an Edge Finder result buffer, after an MedgeCalculate() call. The following result types can be retrieved from the Edge Finder result buffer: General results related to the edge extraction and edge processing. Edge chain results. Edge feature results. If your target image was associated with a camera calibration context, positional and dimensional results are, by default, returned with respect to the relative coordinate system of the image. Otherwise, these results are returned in pixels, relative to the top-left pixel of the image. If your target image was associated with a camera calibration context but you want to retrieve positional and dimensional results in pixel units, use MedgeControl() with the M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS control type set to M_PIXEL. However, note that if you set M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS to M_WORLD without specifying a calibrated image in which to calculate the results, MedgeGetResult() will generate an error. Note that in the presence of distortion, some results are meaningless when converted from real-world to pixel units (for example, the Feret angles). For example, if an edge appears warped in the source image, but the camera calibration context of the source image compensates for this during the extraction, the resulting Feret angles are meaningful in the real-world coordinate system, and meaningless in the pixel coordinate system. Note that, unless otherwise specified, results are only returned to FirstResultArrayPtr; when this is the case, SecondResultArrayPtr must be set to M_NULL. Parameters Parameters EdgeResultId Specifies the identifier of the Edge Finder result buffer from which to get results. EdgeIndexOrLabelValue Specifies the edge(s) from which to get results. This parameter can be set to one of the following values. For edge results Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_ALL. M_ALL Specifies all edges. That is, the target array(s) will be filled with the specified type of result for all the included edges. Note that target array values are ordered by edge indices. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies either the edge's index or label. Index values must fall within the following range: 0 to the number of included edges in the Edge Finder result buffer - 1. Label values can be returned with the result type M_LABEL_VALUE. Combination values for the values listed in For edge results. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to specify whether you are providing an index or a label value. For specifying an index or label value Combination value Description M_TYPE_INDEX Specifies an edge using its index value. This is the default value.

Syntax MIL_INT MedgeInquire( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextOrResultId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;InquireType, //in void&nbsp;*UserVarPtr //out ) Description This function inquires information about the specified Edge Finder context or Edge Finder result buffer. Note that for an Edge Finder result buffer, this function only retrieves information about result buffer settings (set with MedgeControl(), for example). To retrieve results from the Edge Finder result buffer, use MedgeGetResult(). If the inquired setting is set to M_DEFAULT (for example, in MedgeControl()), MedgeInquire() will return M_DEFAULT. To inquire the actual default value, add M_DEFAULT to the InquireType parameter. Parameters Parameters ContextOrResultId Specifies either the Edge Finder context or the Edge Finder result buffer about which to inquire information. Both the Edge Finder context and the Edge Finder result buffer must have been previously allocated on the system using MedgeAlloc() or MedgeAllocResult(), respectively.

The mask is applied to the image that uses the context. Subsequent calls to MedgeCalculate() will therefore extract edges only in the context's unmasked regions. You can also mask edges during post-calculation. In this case, masked edges are excluded from the result buffer and subsequent calculations. Note that partially masked edges are cropped. Parameters Parameters ContextId Specifies the Edge Finder context in which to set the mask. The Edge Finder context must have been previously allocated on the required system using MedgeAlloc(). MaskImageId Specifies the identifier of the image buffer used to identify the masked pixels in the Edge Finder context. For the identifier of the image buffer Value Description M_NULL Specifies to ignore this parameter. This parameter must be set to M_NULL when removing the mask. MIL image buffer identifier Specifies the image buffer to use as a mask. If the size of the mask image is greater than the source image, the mask will be clipped. A masked pixel corresponds to a non-zero value in the mask buffer. Note that this buffer can be calibrated; however, this is not necessary, since the mask is applied on a pixel basis.

This can be useful if you want to construct an Edge Finder result buffer that cannot be obtained from one image. You can therefore combine results from multiple Edge Finder result buffers to, for example, build a complete model to add to a Model Finder context. You must only add edge chains that respect the following constraints, whereby pixels are considered connected based on an 8-connected lattice: Consecutive edgels must occupy separate connected pixels. No branches are allowed (they start or end a separate chain). There must not be an edge in the edge map that is more than 1 pixel wide. This means that the first and fourth edgel in the edge chain must not be in neighboring pixels. All edge chains must be at the same scale and this scale must be the scale at which they were originally extracted. If edges were extracted at a different scale (MedgeControl() with M_EXTRACTION_SCALE), you must convert them to their original extraction scale. If edgels are calculated with pixel accuracy, you must provide edgels with coordinates that are integer values; in this case, the distance between consecutive edgels should be one pixel. If edgels are calculated with subpixel accuracy, you can provide edgels with coordinates that are double values; in this case, the distance between consecutive edgels is such that, each pixel touched by the edge corresponds to one edgel. To change the accuracy edgels are calculated with, use MedgeControl() with M_ACCURACY. To use an Edge Finder result buffer that contains edges set using MedgePut() with the Model Finder module, you must respect the following limitation. First, edges in the source image buffer must have been previously extracted and saved in the Edge Finder result buffer, using MedgeCalculate(). Second, the coordinates of the edge chains in the user-supplied arrays must not exceed the boundaries of the source image buffer. You can inquire the width and height of the source image buffer using MedgeGetResult() with M_SIZE_X and M_SIZE_Y. The X- and Y-coordinates of the edgels you are adding to the Edge Finder result buffer must be provided in pixel units (as opposed to real-world values). If your current results have been calibrated, the coordinates added to those results will be automatically transformed to their appropriate real-world values. For more information, see the Working with real-world units section of Chapter 28: Calibrating your camera setup. Parameters Parameters ResultEdgeId Specifies the identifier of the Edge Finder result buffer in which to put user-supplied data. NumEdgels Specifies the number of edgels to add to the Edge Finder result buffer. When using a standard vector (std::vector) overload function in C++, you can pass M_DEFAULT to this parameter and MIL will automatically determine the size based on the number of items in the vector passed to the PosXArrayPtr or PosYArrayPtr parameter. ChainIndexArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumEdgels) array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumEdgels) Specifies the address of the array containing the indices of the edgels' edges to add to the Edge Finder result buffer.

PosYArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumEdgels) array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumEdgels) Specifies the address of the array containing the Y-coordinate(s) of the edgel(s) to add to the Edge Finder result buffer. AngleArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumEdgels) array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumEdgels) Specifies the address of the array containing the orientation of the edgel(s) to add to the Edge Finder result buffer. If you do not want to provide this information, set this parameter to M_NULL. Angle values must be mapped in the range of 0 to 255. That is, 0 corresponds to 0, and 360 corresponds to 256. MagnitudeArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumEdgels) array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumEdgels) Specifies the address of the array containing the magnitude of the edgel(s) to add to the Edge Finder result buffer.

This function restores all the Edge Finder context's settings that were in effect when the Edge Finder context was saved. When the restored Edge Finder context is no longer required, release it using MedgeFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during allocation; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the restored Edge Finder context's lifetime and you must not manually free it. Parameters Parameters FileName Specifies the name and path of the file from which to restore the Edge Finder context. The function handles (internally) the opening and closing of the file. This parameter can be set to one of the following: For specifying the file name and path Value Description M_INTERACTIVE [This is only applicable to Windows] Opens the File Open dialog box from which you can interactively specify the drive, directory, and name of the file.

For retrieving the identifier or specifying how to return it Value Description M_NULL Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated Edge Finder context ; in this case, a standard MIL identifier of type MIL_ID is returned. M_UNIQUE_ID Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated Edge Finder context ; in this case, a MIL smart identifier of type MIL_UNIQUE_EDGE_ID is returned instead of a standard MIL identifier. This setting is only available when using C++11 (or later). A MIL smart identifier manages the lifespan of the MIL object it owns (similar to a std::unique_ptr). Note, you can use a MIL smart identifier as though it were a standard MIL identifier, except that you cannot use it to manually free the Edge Finder context (it is freed automatically). For more information, see the MIL smart identifiers subsection of the MIL custom data types, void pointers, extensions, and portability functions section of Chapter 2: Building an application. Address in which to write the contour Edge Finder context identifier Specifies the address of a MIL_ID in which to write the identifier of the restored contour Edge Finder context. If allocation fails, M_NULL is written as the identifier. Address in which to write the crest Edge Finder context identifier Specifies the address of a MIL_ID in which to write the identifier of the restored crest Edge Finder context.

This information can be reloaded, using MedgeRestore() or MedgeStream(). However, any associated camera calibration contexts are not saved. This function also saves calculated edges (edge chains and/or edge approximations) included in a previously calculated Edge Finder result buffer to disk, in a standard DXF format CAD file. Note that edge chains and edge approximations are saved in the DXF file in separate layers. Note that the Edge Finder context or the calculated edges are saved in real-world units if there is a camera calibration context associated with them. Otherwise, they are saved in pixel units. Parameters Parameters FileName Specifies the name and path of the file in which to save the Edge Finder context, or the destination CAD file.

These edges will be included in or excluded from future operations (calculations and result retrieval), or deleted entirely from the Edge Finder result buffer. To call this function, MedgeCalculate() must have been called at least once. If this function is not called at least once, all edges are included by default. If there is more than one call to this function, the effect of the calls is cumulative, unless M_INCLUDE_ONLY or M_EXCLUDE_ONLY is specified as the operation to perform. Once an edge has been excluded, it can typically be re-included by specifying M_INCLUDE or M_INCLUDE_ONLY in a future call to this function (with the correct criterion). However, if you use the result buffer with different images (in a call to MedgeCalculate()), all results in the result buffer are discarded and all new edges are re-included. Unlike most other MIL functions, if the edges were extracted from a calibrated source image, you must specify relevant values in world units, although you will have control over the units when retrieving results using MedgeGetResult(). You can use this function to select edges based on one of the following: A calculated edge feature (see MedgeControl()), where the edge selection depends on whether the specified edge feature meets the specified condition. The inter-relationship of edges, where the edge selection depends on whether edges meet the specified box or chain condition of the specified edge or group of edges. The current status of edges, where the edge selection depends on the status of a specific edge, all edges, all included edges, or all excluded edges. These will be included, included only, excluded, excluded only, or deleted. For example, you can include only (M_INCLUDE_ONLY) the excluded edges (M_EXCLUDED_EDGES), which will essentially swap the previously included and excluded edges. The proximity of an edge or edges to a specified point, where the edge selection depends on the specified radius, and the nearest neighbor condition. You can also use this function to crop and select a portion of a specified edge. For more information on the different uses of this function, see the Calculating and retrieving results section of Chapter 10: Edge Finder and the Advanced edge extraction section of Chapter 10: Edge Finder. Parameters Parameters EdgeResultId Specifies the identifier of the Edge Finder result buffer to be used in the edge selection process. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Operation Specifies the operation to perform on the specified edges. Set this parameter to one of the following values. For specifying the operation Value Description M_DELETE Deletes edges that meet the specified condition. M_DELETE affects only included edges, unless otherwise stated by the SelectionCriterion parameter. M_DELETE removes edges permanently from the Edge Finder result buffer and, consequently, prevents these edges from being re-included. M_EXCLUDE Excludes all edges that meet the specified condition. M_EXCLUDE affects only the status of currently included edges. M_EXCLUDE_ONLY Excludes only those edges that meet the specified condition and includes all others. The exclusion does not consider the present status of edges (whether they are excluded), except for edges that have been deleted (M_DELETE), unless otherwise stated by the SelectionCriterion parameter. M_INCLUDE Includes all edges that meet the specified condition. M_INCLUDE affects only the status of currently excluded edges. M_INCLUDE_ONLY Includes only those edges that meet the specified condition and excludes all others. The inclusion does not consider the present status of edges (whether they are included), except for edges that have been deleted (M_DELETE), unless otherwise stated by the SelectionCriterion parameter. SelectionCriterion Specifies on what the selection criterion will be based. Note that for an edge selection based on the proximity of the edges to a point, this parameter must be set to M_NULL. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Condition Specifies the condition for the edge selection. Note that for an edge selection based on the current status of edges, this parameter must be set to M_NULL. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Param1 Specifies a value that is dependent on the feature and condition chosen. If the edges have been calculated using a calibrated source image, you must specify the relevant values in the real world. If this parameter is unused, set it to M_NULL. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Param2 Specifies a value that is dependent on the feature and condition chosen. If the edges have been calculated using a calibrated source image, you must specify the relevant values in the real world. If this parameter is unused, set it to M_NULL. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified.

For specifying the edge selection method For specifying the edge selection method EdgeResultId Description SelectionCriterion Condition Param1 Param2 Edge Finder result buffer identifier for a chain cropping based edge selection Specifies an Edge Finder result buffer on which to perform a chain cropping edge selection. This type of selection essentially splits off a portion of a single specified edge, assigns the portion a new edge label, and selects the portion for inclusion, exclusion, or deletion from future operations on the result buffer. The other portion keeps its current edge label value and status. The two portions are considered two touching edges after the split. Therefore, all their calculated edge features are updated after the split. The specified edgel index value is the dividing point. SelectionCriterion Sets the selection criterion.

Syntax void MedgeStream( MIL_TEXT_PTR&nbsp;MemPtrOrFileName, //in-out MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Operation, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;StreamType, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Version, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*ContextOrResultEdgeIdPtr, //in-out MIL_INT&nbsp;*SizeByteVarPtr //out ) Description This function can load, restore, or save an Edge Finder context from/to a file or memory stream. Moreover, this function can save previously calculated edges (edge chains and/or edge approximations), stored in an Edge Finder result buffer, to a file or memory stream in a standard CAD DXF format. Edge chains and edge approximations are saved in the DXF file or memory stream in separate layers. Note that you cannot load or restore any CAD DXF file or memory stream using this function. To inquire the number of bytes necessary to save an Edge Finder context or calculated edges to memory stream, you should first call this function (MedgeStream()) with M_INQUIRE_SIZE_BYTE. The content saved to memory stream is equivalent to the content saved to file. This function is equivalent to a file saved using MedgeSave(). You can use this and other MIL stream functions, for example, to save all required MIL objects, as well as any other custom data, for your application to a memory stream. Once in a memory stream, you can write the stream to a single file or transfer it over a network. You are responsible for concatenating the streams and for saving the stream to file. Using MedgeStream(), you can choose to save a backwards-compatible version of the Edge Finder context, which will work using a version of MIL that is up to one major release older than the current version (depending on which version is specified). For example, if you allocate an Edge Finder context using MIL 10.0 and save it to version 9.0, you can restore this context on a computer where MIL 9.0 is installed. However, all settings and features unique to the higher version will be ignored when restored using the lower version. Besides saving backwards-compatible versions, you can also load or restore Edge Finder contexts saved using MIL version 7.5 or above. Settings that do not exist in the lower version will be filled with default values when the Edge Finder context is loaded or restored. Parameters Parameters MemPtrOrFileName Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): MIL_TEXT_PTR [optionally, in C++: a reference to a MIL_STRING] Optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector of type MIL_UINT8 Specifies the file or memory stream.

  "text": " Mstr functions Synopsis The functions prefixed with Mstr make up the String Reader module. The String Reader module performs character recognition using feature-based technology. The module is invariant to changes in scale, aspect ratio, and contrast. String Reader also offers considerable tolerance towards variations in perspective and angle. In addition, String Reader supports multiple user-defined grammar rules and multi-font definitions in a single context, and features a powerful Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy font definition. String Reader also offers an expert function, allowing you to quickly determine why your application is not reading the strings that you expect it to read. These features make the String Reader module the ideal tool for writing seemingly complex applications, such as Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) programs.

Syntax MIL_ID MstrAlloc( MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ContextType, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*ObjectIdPtr //out ) Description This function allocates a String Reader context on the specified system. A String Reader context contains the read parameters, the list of fonts, and the list of string models. Note that you cannot allocate a fontless context. You must restore one of the predefined fontless context that is distributed with MIL using MstrRestore(). When the String Reader context is no longer required, release it using MstrFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during allocation; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the String Reader context's lifetime and you must not manually free it. Parameters Parameters SysId Specifies the system on which to allocate the String Reader context. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the system identifier Value Description M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). ContextType Specifies the type of String Reader context. This parameter must be set to the value below. For specifying the context Value Description M_FONT_BASED Specifies a font-based context. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. ObjectIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the String Reader context identifier or specifies the data type that the function should use to return the String Reader context identifier. For retrieving the identifier or specifying how to return it Value Description M_NULL Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated String Reader context ; in this case, a standard MIL identifier of type MIL_ID is returned. M_UNIQUE_ID Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated String Reader context ; in this case, a MIL smart identifier of type MIL_UNIQUE_STR_ID is returned instead of a standard MIL identifier. This setting is only available when using C++11 (or later). A MIL smart identifier manages the lifespan of the MIL object it owns (similar to a std::unique_ptr). Note, you can use a MIL smart identifier as though it were a standard MIL identifier, except that you cannot use it to manually free the String Reader context (it is freed automatically). For more information, see the MIL smart identifiers subsection of the MIL custom data types, void pointers, extensions, and portability functions section of Chapter 2: Building an application. Address in which to write the identifier Specifies the address of a MIL_ID in which to write the identifier of the allocated String Reader context. If allocation fails, M_NULL is written as the identifier. Return value The returned value is the String Reader context identifier either as a standard identifier (MIL_ID) or a smart identifier (MIL_UNIQUE_STR_ID). If allocation fails, M_NULL is returned (or nullptr if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified). Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; milstr.lib. DLL Requires mil.dll; milstr.dll.

Syntax void MstrControl( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextOrResultId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;Index, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlType, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;ControlValue //in ) Description This function sets the specified control for a String Reader context, for one (or all) of the specified string models or fonts contained therein, or a result buffer. These settings control the execution of MstrRead() operations. All the control type settings can be inquired using MstrInquire(). Changing certain control type settings might require preprocessing the String Reader context again, using MstrPreprocess(). To know if the String Reader context needs to be preprocessed, call MstrInquire() with M_PREPROCESSED. Unless otherwise specified, the control type settings are applicable to both font-based and fontless contexts. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler) in 64-bit mode, MstrControl() internally calls the MIL_DOUBLE version of this function (MstrControlDouble()). If you need to pass large integer values (including pointers), call the MIL_INT64 version of this function (MstrControlInt64()). Parameters Parameters ContextOrResultId Specifies the String Reader context or result buffer whose settings to modify. The String Reader context must have been previously allocated on the system using MstrAlloc(). The String Reader result buffer must have been previously allocated on the system using MstrAllocResult(). Index Specifies that the String Reader context, a specific font, a specific string model, or a result buffer is controlled. Set this parameter to one of the following values. For a String Reader context, specific font, specific string model, or result buffer Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default. If a String Reader context is specified, same as M_CONTEXT. If a String Reader result buffer is specified, same as M_GENERAL. M_FONT_INDEX( MIL_INT FontIndex ) Specifies to apply the control settings to a font. Note that this value is only available for a font-based context. Parameters FontIndex This parameter specifies the index of the font. You can set this parameter to one of the following: M_ALL Specifies to apply the control settings to all fonts. 0 &lt;= Value &lt; M_NUMBER_OF_FONTS Specifies the index of the individual font to which to apply the control settings. User labels cannot be used as indices; to retrieve the index of a font from its user label, use MstrInquire() with M_FONT_INDEX_FROM_LABEL. M_STRING_INDEX( MIL_INT StringIndex ) Specifies to apply the control settings to a string. Parameters StringIndex This parameter specifies the index of the string. You can set this parameter to one of the following: M_ALL Specifies to apply the control settings to all strings. Note that to apply control settings to all strings, the ControlType and ControlValue parameters must be supported by all the string models. 0 &lt;= Value &lt; M_NUMBER_OF_STRING_MODELS Specifies the index of the individual string to which to apply the control settings. User labels cannot be used as indices; to retrieve the index of a string from its user label, use MstrInquire() with M_STRING_INDEX_FROM_LABEL. M_CONTEXT Specifies that a general setting of a String Reader context will be controlled. M_GENERAL Specifies that a general setting of a String Reader result buffer will be controlled, if one is specified. ControlType Specifies the setting to change. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ControlValue Specifies the setting's new value. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Parameter associations The tables below list possible values for the ControlType and ControlValue parameters. For the context or a specific string For the context For a specific string For a specific font For a font-based or a fontless context For the result buffer The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be specified for either the String Reader context (M_CONTEXT) or each specific string in the String Reader context (M_STRING_INDEX()). For the context or a specific string ControlType Description ControlValue M_STRING_NUMBER Sets either the maximum (total) number of all strings that can be read with a String Reader context (M_CONTEXT), or the maximum number of a specific string (M_STRING_INDEX()) that can be read with a String Reader context. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1. M_ALL Specifies that all strings will be read. Note that this setting can increase the read time; always set M_STRING_NUMBER to a specific number whenever possible. Value Specifies the maximum number of strings that can be read. For M_CONTEXT, this value specifies the maximum (total) number of strings that can be read. Any value greater than or equal to 1 can be set. For M_STRING_INDEX(), this value specifies the maximum number of a specific string model that can be read. Any value greater than or equal to 0 can be set. The possible ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings for the String Reader context (M_CONTEXT) are: For the context ControlType Description ControlValue M_DISABLE_CHAR Disables the specified character in the fontless context. Only uppercase characters and numbers can be disabled. The String Reader module will not try to match found characters with disabled characters. Note that this control type is only available for a fontless context. M_ALL Specifies that no characters will be read. ASCII value Specifies the ASCII value of the character to disable. M_ENABLE_CHAR Enables the specified character in the fontless context. Only uppercase characters and numbers can be enabled. The String Reader module will only try to identify enabled characters. Note that this control type is only available for a fontless context. M_ALL Specifies that all characters will be read. This is the default value. ASCII value Specifies the ASCII value of the character. M_ENCODING Sets the type of character encoding used by the String Reader context. All functions that accept or return a string of characters as a parameter use character encoding to determine the type of the pointer. The type of character encoding is also used as the default result type (MstrGetResult()) for a string of characters. The character encoding cannot be changed when there are characters in the context whose ASCII character values lie outside the range [0, 127]. This applies to characters which are in fonts and constraints. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ASCII. M_ASCII Specifies an 8-bit ASCII standard. This corresponds to the char data type. M_UNICODE Specifies a 16-bit Unicode standard. This corresponds to the short data type. M_FONT_ADD Adds an empty font to the String Reader context. The maximum number of fonts in a String Reader context is 255. Note that this control type is only available for a font-based context. M_DEFAULT Same as M_USER_DEFINED. M_USER_DEFINED Specifies a user-defined type of font. Initially, the font is empty. To add characters to the font, or to edit it, use MstrEditFont(). M_FONT_DELETE Deletes a font from the String Reader context. Note that this control type is only available for a font-based context. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ALL. M_ALL Specifies that all fonts will be deleted. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the index of the font to delete. M_MAX_CHAR_SIZE_X Sets the width (X-size) of the widest enabled character in the fontless context. Specify the width that the character has when it has a height of M_REF_CHAR_SIZE_Y. If the read algorithm encounters a character with a height other than M_REF_CHAR_SIZE_Y, the maximum width will be interpolated. Note that this control type is only available for a fontless context. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 65 pixels. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 65536 Specifies the maximum character width, in pixels. M_MIN_CHAR_SIZE_X Sets the width (X-size) of the narrowest enabled character in the fontless context. Specify the width that the character has when it has a height of M_REF_CHAR_SIZE_Y. If the read algorithm encounters a character with a height other than M_REF_CHAR_SIZE_Y, the minimum width will be interpolated. Note that this control type is only available for a fontless context. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 6 pixels. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 65536 Specifies the minimum character width, in pixels. M_MINIMUM_CONTRAST Sets the minimum contrast between a character in the target image and its background, in order for the character to be read by MstrRead(). Increasing the minimum contrast will typically speed up the read operation, particularly in presence of noise; however, if the minimum contrast is higher than the contrast of an actual character, that character will be lost. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 15. 1 &lt;= Value &lt;= 255 Specifies the minimum contrast. M_REF_CHAR_SIZE_Y Sets the height which will be the reference for M_MIN_CHAR_SIZE_X, M_MAX_CHAR_SIZE_X, and M_REF_CHAR_THICKNESS. The reference height is the height at which you specify the width of the narrowest and widest characters, as well as their thickness, with M_MIN_CHAR_SIZE_X, M_MAX_CHAR_SIZE_X, and M_REF_CHAR_THICKNESS, respectively. Note that this control type is only available for a fontless context. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 46 pixels. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 65536 Specifies the height, in pixels. M_REF_CHAR_THICKNESS Sets the thickness (stroke width) of enabled characters in the fontless context. Specify the thickness of characters when they have a height of M_REF_CHAR_SIZE_Y. If the read algorithm encounters a character with a height other than M_REF_CHAR_SIZE_Y, the maximum width will be interpolated. Note that this control type is only available for a fontless context. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 6 pixels. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 65536 Specifies the thickness, in pixels. M_SEARCH_CHAR_ANGLE Sets whether to perform calculations specific to angular-range search strategies, for characters. The read algorithm is naturally robust to variations in a character's angle. Therefore, a character might still be read correctly, even if M_SEARCH_CHAR_ANGLE is disabled. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies not to perform calculations specific to angular-range search strategies. M_ENABLE Specifies to perform calculations specific to angular-range search strategies. M_SEARCH_SKEW_ANGLE Sets whether to perform calculations specific to angular-range skew search strategies, for characters. The read algorithm is naturally robust to variations in a character's skew. Therefore, a character might still be read correctly, even if M_SEARCH_SKEW_ANGLE is disabled. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies not to perform calculations specific to angular-range skew search strategies. M_ENABLE Specifies to perform calculations specific to angular-range skew search strategies. M_SEARCH_STRING_ANGLE Sets whether to search for the string angle. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ENABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies not to search for the string angle. M_ENABLE Specifies to search for the string angle. M_SPACE_CHARACTER Sets the character value to use as a space character within the formatted string or text that will be read. M_SPACE_CHARACTER applies only when getting the formatted string (MstrGetResult() with M_FORMATTED_STRING) or the formatted text (MstrGetResult() with M_TEXT). A space character is inserted in the string each time the distance between two adjacent characters exceeds the space width, at the scale of the string. The space character must be set before the string is read. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is numerical ASCII code 32. M_NONE Specifies no space character. Value Specifies the space character, as its numerical code (ASCII or Unicode). For example, ASCII 10 results in a new line character, ASCII 32 results in a space character. Note that the character value must be cast to a MIL_DOUBLE. M_SPEED Sets the search and read speed of the MstrRead() operation. Note that increasing the speed can decrease the robustness of MstrRead(). M_DEFAULT Same as M_MEDIUM. M_HIGH Specifies a high speed. M_MEDIUM Specifies a medium speed. M_STOP_EXPERT Stops the current string expert operation. Note that you can only perform this operation from another thread of higher priority. M_DEFAULT Implements the default behavior. M_STOP_READ Stops the current string read operation. Note that you can only perform this operation from another thread of higher priority. M_DEFAULT Implements the default behavior. M_STRING_ADD Adds a string model to the String Reader context. The maximum number of string models in a String Reader context is 255. M_DEFAULT Same as M_USER_DEFINED. M_USER_DEFINED Specifies a user-defined type of string model. Initially, a user-defined string model does not have any constraints, does not use any checksum error detection, and all its parameters are set to their default value. M_STRING_DELETE Deletes a string from the String Reader context. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ALL. M_ALL Specifies that all strings will be deleted. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the index of the string to delete. M_STRING_SEPARATOR Sets the character value to use as a string separator within the formatted text that will be read. M_STRING_SEPARATOR applies only when getting the formatted text (MstrGetResult() with M_TEXT). A string separator is inserted between each string in the text; that is, each time the distance between two adjacent characters is greater than the space size. The space size depends on the space width (at the scale of the string) and the maximum number of consecutive spaces. The string separator character must be set before the string is read. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is numerical ASCII code 10. M_NONE Specifies no separator character. Value Specifies the separator character, as its numerical code (ASCII or Unicode). For example, ASCII 10 results in a new line character, ASCII 32 results in a space character. Note that the character value must be cast to a MIL_DOUBLE. M_THICKEN_CHAR Sets the number of character thickening iterations. Each iteration enlarges the thickness of the target character. This is useful for some types of fonts (for example, dotted characters). You should choose a value large enough for the intra character dots to connect but not too large to connect separate characters together. Note that the characters included in the font should not be dotted. Instead a thickened version should be included. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100 Specifies the number of character thickening iterations. M_THRESHOLD_MODE Sets the threshold method of the character blob extraction. M_DEFAULT Same as M_LOCAL_WITH_RESEGMENTATION. M_LOCAL Specifies a local thresholding that uses only one threshold step that is automatically computed by the module. This threshold method can be used in various contrast situations and can improve the read operation's speed, compared to M_LOCAL_WITH_RESEGMENTATION. M_LOCAL_WITH_RESEGMENTATION Specifies a local thresholding that uses multiple threshold steps and split and merge techniques. This threshold method allows the module to extract character blobs in low contrast and in complex situations such as merged or broken characters. M_USER_DEFINED Specifies a global thresholding that uses the threshold value set with M_THRESHOLD_VALUE. This threshold method improves the read operation's speed, compared to M_LOCAL_WITH_RESEGMENTATION and M_LOCAL. M_THRESHOLD_VALUE Sets the global threshold value when M_THRESHOLD_MODE is set to M_USER_DEFINED (otherwise it is ignored). Note that two different threshold values, which should segment the target image in exactly the same way, might produce different results, even when using a binarized target image. This is because during the read operation, the image is occasionally resized or rotated internally which can cause pixels to be interpolated. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO_COMPUTE. M_AUTO_COMPUTE Specifies to automatically compute the global threshold value. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 255 Specifies the threshold value. M_TIMEOUT Sets the maximum read time for MstrRead(), in msec. If the read operation times out, the strings read up to that point will be returned as a result. Note that the actual maximum read time might vary slightly from the time that you set. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 2000.0 msec. M_DISABLE Specifies an infinite amount of read time. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the maximum read time, in msec. The possible ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings for a specific string (M_STRING_INDEX()) are: For a specific string ControlType Description ControlValue M_CHAR_ACCEPTANCE Sets the acceptance level for the character score. The character's score quantifies the similarity between the character in the target and the character in the font; it also quantifies the similarity between the character in the target and the other characters of the string in the target. To be accepted as a string result, the character's score must be greater than or equal to M_CHAR_ACCEPTANCE. Scores can be retrieved with MstrGetResult(). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 50.0%. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies an acceptable score, as a percentage. M_CHAR_ASPECT_RATIO_MAX_FACTOR Sets the factor used to determine the maximum acceptable aspect ratio for the characters in the string. This value is relative to the found string aspect ratio. That is, UpperLimit = FoundStringAspectRatio x M_CHAR_ASPECT_RATIO_MAX_FACTOR. This value sets the maximum possible aspect ratio variation for the characters in the string. Characters with an aspect ratio outside the aspect ratio range will not be returned as results. Note that this control type is only available for a font-based context. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.1. 1.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 2.0 Specifies the factor that determines the maximum aspect ratio of the characters in the string. M_CHAR_ASPECT_RATIO_MIN_FACTOR Sets the factor used to determine the minimum acceptable aspect ratio for the characters in the string. This value is relative to the found string aspect ratio. That is, LowerLimit = FoundStringAspectRatio x M_CHAR_ASPECT_RATIO_MIN_FACTOR. This value sets the minimum possible aspect ratio variation for the characters in the string. Characters with an aspect ratio outside the aspect ratio range will not be returned as results. Note that this control type is only available for a font-based context. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.9. 0.5 &lt;= Value &lt;= 1.0 Specifies the factor that determines the minimum aspect ratio of the characters in the string. M_CHAR_HOMOGENEITY_ACCEPTANCE Sets the acceptance level for the character's homogeneity score. The character's homogeneity score quantifies the similarity between the character in the target and the other characters of the string in the target. To be accepted as a string result, the character's homogeneity score must be greater than or equal to M_CHAR_HOMOGENEITY_ACCEPTANCE. Scores can be retrieved with MstrGetResult(). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 50.0%. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies an acceptable score, as a percentage. M_CHAR_MAX_BASELINE_DEVIATION Sets the maximum baseline deviation that all characters defined in the font can have in the target image. A character's maximum baseline deviation is the maximum tolerable baseline deviation that a character in a string can have before it is rejected from the string. For more information on character baseline deviations, see the Character's maximum baseline deviation subsection of the Degrees of freedom section of Chapter 14: String Reader. Note that for non-punctuation characters, String Reader calculates the baseline deviation, as a percentage of each individual character's height (Y-size). For example, a baseline deviation of 10 means that a character's baseline deviates from the string's baseline by 10% of the character's height (Y-size). For punctuation characters (M_PUNCTUATION), String Reader calculates the baseline deviation as a percentage of the height of the character with the greatest Y-size in the font. For example, a baseline deviation of 10 means that the punctuation character's baseline deviates from the string's baseline by 10% of the height of the tallest character in the font. This is done because the Y-size of punctuation characters is typically too small to calculate the baseline deviation as a percentage of the character's height. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 10. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100 Specifies the character's maximum baseline deviation within the string model. M_CHAR_SCALE_MAX_FACTOR Sets the factor used to determine the upper limit (maximum permitted scale) of the scale range for the characters in the string. This value is relative to the found string scale. That is, UpperLimit = FoundStringScale x M_CHAR_SCALE_MAX_FACTOR. This value sets the possible increasing scale variation for the characters in the string. Characters with a scale outside the scale range will not be returned as results. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.1. 1.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 2.0 Specifies the factor that determines the maximum scale of the characters in the string. M_CHAR_SCALE_MIN_FACTOR Sets the factor used to determine the lower limit (minimum permitted scale) of the scale range for the characters in the string. This value is relative to the found string scale. That is, LowerLimit = FoundStringScale x M_CHAR_SCALE_MIN_FACTOR. This value sets the possible decreasing scale variation for the characters in the string. Characters with a scale outside the scale range will not be returned as results. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.9. 0.5 &lt;= Value &lt;= 1.0 Specifies the factor that determines the minimum scale of the characters in the string. M_CHAR_SIMILARITY_ACCEPTANCE Sets the acceptance level for the character's similarity score. The character's similarity score quantifies the similarity between the character in the target and the character in the font. To be accepted as a string result, the character's similarity score must be greater than or equal to M_CHAR_SIMILARITY_ACCEPTANCE. Scores can be retrieved with MstrGetResult(). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 50.0%. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies an acceptable score, as a percentage. M_FOREGROUND_VALUE Sets the foreground color of the string. M_DEFAULT Same as M_FOREGROUND_BLACK. M_FOREGROUND_BLACK Specifies that black is the foreground color of the string. M_FOREGROUND_BLACK_OR_WHITE Specifies that the foreground color of the string can be either black or white. M_FOREGROUND_WHITE Specifies that white is the foreground color of the string. M_SPACE_MAX_CONSECUTIVE Sets the maximum number of consecutive space characters allowed in the string. Together with the space width (MstrControl() with M_SPACE_WIDTH), M_SPACE_MAX_CONSECUTIVE determines the maximum distance between 2 adjacent characters of the same string. If the distance between two characters is greater than the maximum distance, then they are considered to be part of 2 different strings. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 3. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the maximum number of consecutive space characters. M_STRING_ACCEPTANCE Sets the acceptance level for the string score. To be accepted as a string result, both the string's score and the string target score must be greater than or equal to their respective acceptance levels. The string score is the average score of the characters in the string. Scores can be retrieved with MstrGetResult(). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 50.0%. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies an acceptable score, as a percentage. M_STRING_ANGLE Sets the nominal angle of the string. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ACCORDING_TO_REGION. M_ACCORDING_TO_REGION Specifies to set the nominal angle to the angle of the rectangular ROI (set using MbufSetRegion()) in the image. If no region of interest has been defined, the default value is 0.0°. This implies that to read a string at an angle, the target image must have a rectangular ROI defined around the string to be read, and that ROI should be at an angle. M_STRING_ANGLE_DELTA_NEG Sets the lower limit of the string's angular range, relative to the nominal angle (MstrControl() with M_STRING_ANGLE). That is, LowerLimit = M_STRING_ANGLE - M_STRING_ANGLE_DELTA_NEG. This value sets the possible clockwise angular variation of the string. Strings with angles outside the angular range will not be returned as results. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 10.0°. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 10.0 Specifies the lower limit of the angular range, in degrees. M_STRING_ANGLE_DELTA_POS Sets the upper limit of the angular range, relative to the nominal angle (MstrControl() with M_STRING_ANGLE). That is, UpperLimit = M_STRING_ANGLE + M_STRING_ANGLE_DELTA_POS. This value sets the possible counter-clockwise angular variation of the string. Strings with angles outside the angular range will not be returned as results. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 10.0°. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 10.0 Specifies the upper limit of the angular range, in degrees. M_STRING_ASPECT_RATIO Sets the nominal aspect ratio of the string. The aspect ratio of the string is the median aspect ratio of all the characters in the string, while the aspect ratio of a character is the ratio of its scale in X by its scale in Y. This indicates how the width and the height of the characters in the string vary relative to the characters in the font. Note that this control type is only available for a font-based context. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. 0.5 &lt;= Value &lt;= 2.0 Specifies the ratio of pixel width to pixel height of the target. M_STRING_ASPECT_RATIO_MAX_FACTOR Sets the factor used to determine the upper limit of the string's aspect ratio. This value is relative to the nominal aspect ratio (MstrControl() with M_STRING_ASPECT_RATIO). That is, UpperLimit = M_STRING_ASPECT_RATIO x M_STRING_ASPECT_RATIO_MAX_FACTOR. This value sets the possible increasing aspect ratio variation for the string. Strings with an aspect ratio outside the aspect ratio range will not be returned as results. Note that this control type is only available for a font-based context. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.25. 1.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 2.0 Specifies the factor that determines the maximum aspect ratio of the string. M_STRING_ASPECT_RATIO_MIN_FACTOR Sets the factor used to determine the lower limit of the string's aspect ratio. This value is relative to the nominal aspect ratio (MstrControl() with M_STRING_ASPECT_RATIO). That is, LowerLimit = M_STRING_ASPECT_RATIO x M_STRING_ASPECT_RATIO_MIN_FACTOR. This value sets the possible decreasing aspect ratio variation for the string. Strings with an aspect ratio outside the aspect ratio range will not be returned as results. Note that this control type is only available for a font-based context. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.8. 0.5 &lt;= Value &lt;= 1.0 Specifies the factor that determines the minimum aspect ratio of the string. M_STRING_CERTAINTY Sets the certainty level for the string score. If both the string score and the string target score of a string candidate are above their respective certainty levels, the candidate is immediately considered a string result, without reading the rest of the target image for a string with higher scores (provided the specified number of strings to read has been read). Scores can be retrieved with MstrGetResult(). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 70.0%. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the certainty level for the string score, as a percentage. M_STRING_SCALE Sets the nominal scale of the string. The scale of the string is the median scale in the X-direction of all the characters in the string. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. 0.25 &lt;= Value &lt;= 4.0 Specifies the value of the scale. M_STRING_SCALE_MAX_FACTOR Sets the factor used to determine the upper limit (maximum permitted scale) of the string's scale range. This value is relative to the nominal scale (MstrControl() with M_STRING_SCALE). That is, UpperLimit = M_STRING_SCALE x M_STRING_SCALE_MAX_FACTOR. This value sets the possible increasing scale variation for the string. Strings with a scale outside the scale range will not be returned as results. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 2.0. 1.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 2.0 Specifies the factor that determines the minimum scale of the string. M_STRING_SCALE_MIN_FACTOR Sets the factor used to determine the lower limit (minimum permitted scale) of the string's scale range. This value is relative to the nominal scale (MstrControl() with M_STRING_SCALE). That is, LowerLimit = M_STRING_SCALE x M_STRING_SCALE_MIN_FACTOR. This value sets the possible decreasing scale variation for the string. Strings with a scale outside the scale range will not be returned as results. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.5. 0.5 &lt;= Value &lt;= 1.0 Specifies the factor that determines the minimum scale of the string. M_STRING_SIZE_MAX Sets the maximum string size (number of characters) of the string model. The space characters are not counted in the string size. The maximum string size must be greater than or equal to the minimum string size (MstrControl() with M_STRING_SIZE_MIN). M_DEFAULT Same as M_INFINITE. M_INFINITE Specifies no maximum string size. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the maximum string size. M_STRING_SIZE_MIN Sets the minimum string size (number of characters) of the string model. The space characters are not counted in the string size. The minimum string size must be lower than or equal to the maximum string size (MstrControl() with M_STRING_SIZE_MAX). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the minimum string size. M_STRING_TARGET_ACCEPTANCE Sets the acceptance level for the string target score. To be accepted as a string result, both the string's score and the string target score must be greater than or equal to their respective acceptance levels. The string target score is computed from the unread characters that are in the region of the string in the target image. These otherwise readable characters remain unread due to user-specified constraints, such as scale and grammar restrictions. The more unread characters there are, the lower the target score will be. Scores can be retrieved with MstrGetResult(). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 50.0%. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies an acceptable string target score, as a percentage. M_STRING_TARGET_CERTAINTY Sets the certainty level for the string target score. If both the string score and the string target score of a string candidate are above their respective certainty levels, the candidate is immediately considered a string result, without reading the rest of the target image for a string with higher scores (provided the specified number of strings to read has been read). Scores can be retrieved with MstrGetResult(). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 70.0%. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the certainty level for the string target score, as a percentage. M_STRING_USER_LABEL Sets a unique user-defined label for the specified string model. This label can be used as a means of identifying your string model, independently from its index, in the String Reader context. M_DEFAULT Same as M_NO_LABEL. M_NO_LABEL Specifies that no user label is associated with the string model. Value Specifies the user label of the string model. The value must be an integer that is not associated as a label with any other string model in the String Reader context. Since the same label cannot be associated with multiple string models, you cannot pass a user label if you use MstrControl() with M_STRING_INDEX() set to M_ALL. The possible ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings for a specific font (M_FONT_INDEX()) are: For a specific font ControlType Description ControlValue M_DRAW_BOX_MARGIN_X Sets the margin in the X-direction, between the character box and the drawing box. The character box is the bounding box of the character. The drawing box is the box used for drawing purposes. For more information, see MstrDraw(). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 3. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the horizontal margin, in pixels. M_DRAW_BOX_MARGIN_Y Sets the margin in the Y-direction, between the character box and the drawing box. The character box is the bounding box of the character. The drawing box is the box used for drawing purposes. For more information, see MstrDraw(). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 3. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the vertical margin, in pixels. M_FONT_USER_LABEL Sets a unique user-defined label for the specified font. This label can be used as a means of identifying your font, independently from its index, in the String Reader context. M_DEFAULT Same as M_NO_LABEL. M_NO_LABEL Specifies that no user label is associated with the font. Value Specifies the user label of the font. The value must be an integer that is not associated as a label with any other font in the String Reader context. Since the same label cannot be associated with multiple fonts, you cannot pass a user label if you use MstrControl() with M_FONT_INDEX() set to M_ALL. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be specified for either a font-based context or for a fontless context. Note that the Index parameter must be set to M_FONT_INDEX() for a font-based context or to M_CONTEXT for a fontless context. For a font-based or a fontless context ControlType Description ControlValue M_SPACE_WIDTH Sets the width of the space character of the font. Note that the space character is not like other characters in the font. For example, you cannot set it as a constraint (MstrSetConstraint()), and it is not counted in the string size (MstrControl() with M_STRING_SIZE_MIN and M_STRING_SIZE_MAX). For more information, see MstrGetResult() with M_STRING_SIZE, M_STRING, and M_FORMATTED_STRING. Together with the maximum number of consecutive space characters allowed in the string (MstrControl() with M_SPACE_MAX_CONSECUTIVE), M_SPACE_WIDTH determines the maximum distance between 2 adjacent characters of the same string. If the distance between two characters is greater than the maximum distance, then they are considered to be part of 2 different strings. M_SPACE_WIDTH also determines how to convert the distance into space characters, when getting formatted string results (MstrGetResult() with M_FORMATTED_STRING). M_DEFAULT Same as M_MEAN_CHAR_WIDTH. M_INFINITE Specifies that the width of the space character is infinite. In this case, all characters on the same line are always part of the same string. Also, there will never be a space character in the read string since the distance can never be large enough to constitute a space character. M_MAX_CHAR_WIDTH Specifies that the width of the space character is equal to the maximum character X-size of the font. M_MEAN_CHAR_WIDTH Specifies that the width of the space character is equal to the average character X-size of the font. M_MIN_CHAR_WIDTH Specifies that the width of the space character is equal to the minimum character X-size of the font. M_QUARTER_MAX_CHAR_WIDTH Specifies that the width of the space character is equal to a quarter of the maximum character width of the font. M_QUARTER_MAX_CHAR_WIDTH is the closest to the typical space width of a standard font. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the width of the space character, in pixels. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to control settings of the result buffer. Note that the Index parameter must be set to M_GENERAL. For the result buffer ControlType Description ControlValue M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS Sets whether to return results in pixels or world units. This essentially sets the output coordinate system to use. The setting of this control type will only affect functions within this module which return positional results. This control type can be changed at any time to return results in the required output units. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ACCORDING_TO_CALIBRATION. M_ACCORDING_TO_CALIBRATION Specifies that results are returned in world units if the result was calculated on an image associated with a camera calibration context; otherwise, specifies that results are returned in pixel units. M_PIXEL Specifies that results are returned in pixel units, with respect to the pixel coordinate system. M_WORLD Specifies that results are returned in world units, with respect to the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, calling MstrGetResult() generates an error if the result was not calculated on a calibrated image.

Syntax void MstrDraw( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextGraId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextOrResultStrId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufOrListGraId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Operation, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;Index, //in const void&nbsp;*CharListPtr, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function draws specific features of the String Reader context or String Reader results in the destination image buffer or specified 2D graphics list. After each drawing operation, the optimal image size that was needed for that operation is recorded in the String Reader context or result buffer (depending on what is passed) and can be inquired using MstrInquire with M_DRAW_LAST_SIZE_X and M_DRAW_LAST_SIZE_Y. When M_NULL is passed as the destination image (DstImageBufOrListGraId parameter), this function only records the optional image size for the specified drawing operation; that is, the drawing operation is not performed. This can be used to get the optimal image buffer size for the drawing operation. Parameters Parameters ContextGraId Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics context to use when drawing. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For specifying the 2D graphics context Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the default 2D graphics context of the current MIL application is used. Note that there is a different default 2D graphics context for each thread. MIL 2D graphics context identifier Specifies a valid 2D graphics context identifier, which you have allocated using MgraAlloc(). ContextOrResultStrId Specifies the String Reader context or String Reader result buffer from which to extract the features to draw. The String Reader context or result buffer must have been previously allocated on the system using MstrAlloc() or MstrAllocResult(), respectively. DstImageBufOrListGraId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer or 2D graphics list in which to draw. The buffer can be any valid MIL image buffer allocated using MbufAlloc...(). The 2D graphics list must be previously allocated using MgraAllocList(). By drawing into a display's overlay buffer or associating the 2D graphics list with the display, you can also annotate an image non-destructively. When ContextOrResultStrId is set to the identifier of a String Reader context and the Operation parameter is set to M_DRAW_CHAR, this parameter can be set to any valid MIL image buffer, a 2D graphics list, or M_NULL. In any other case, this parameter can be set to the identifier of an image buffer or a 2D graphics list. If specifying an image buffer, it must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. When this parameter is set to M_NULL, this function only records the optional image size for the specified drawing operation; that is, the drawing operation is not performed. Use MstrInquire() with M_DRAW_LAST_... to retrieve the size. Operation Specifies the type of operation to perform. The following Operation parameter value can only be set for a String Reader context. For a font-based context Value Description M_DRAW_CHAR Draws a character representation of the font in the destination image. Characters are drawn from left to right, and from top to bottom. Characters that fall outside the destination image are clipped. The characters are drawn according to their draw box margin, set using MstrControl() with M_DRAW_BOX_MARGIN_X and M_DRAW_BOX_MARGIN_Y. This margin will determine the amount of white space between each character that is drawn. Note that this operation is only available if using a font-based context. The 2D graphics context cannot have its input units set to world units (MgraControl() with M_INPUT_UNITS set to M_WORLD) when drawing with this operation in either an image buffer or a 2D graphics list. If drawing in a zoomed and offset region, only integer values must be used (MgraControl() with M_DRAW_OFFSET_X, M_DRAW_OFFSET_Y, M_DRAW_ZOOM_X, and M_DRAW_ZOOM_Y set to integer values). The following Operation parameter values can only be set for a String Reader result buffer. Note that these values can be added together to draw multiple features at once. Unless otherwise specified, you can use these operations if results were obtained using either a font-based or a fontless context. When applicable, features are always drawn at the location read in the target with the correct angle, scale, and aspect ratio. For a result buffer Value Description M_DRAW_MIL_FONT_STRING Draws all the characters of the String Reader result(s) under the bottom-left corner of the string bounding box (M_DRAW_STRING_BOX). The font associated with the 2D graphics context is used to draw the characters. M_DRAW_STRING Draws all the characters of String Reader result(s). Note that this operation is only available if the results were obtained using a font-based context. The 2D graphics context cannot have its input units set to world units (MgraControl() with M_INPUT_UNITS set to M_WORLD) when drawing with this operation in either an image buffer or a 2D graphics list. If drawing in a zoomed and offset region, only integer values must be used (MgraControl() with M_DRAW_OFFSET_X, M_DRAW_OFFSET_Y, M_DRAW_ZOOM_X, and M_DRAW_ZOOM_Y set to integer values). M_DRAW_STRING_BOX Draws a box around the string that is read in the target. Note that the bounding box of the string is the bounding box of all the string's characters, including the draw margin (set with M_DRAW_BOX_MARGIN_X and M_DRAW_BOX_MARGIN_Y in MstrControl()). M_DRAW_STRING_CHAR_BOX Draws all the character boxes of the String Reader result(s). The character box drawn is the bounding box of the character plus the draw margin (set with M_DRAW_BOX_MARGIN_X and M_DRAW_BOX_MARGIN_Y in MstrControl()). M_DRAW_STRING_CHAR_POSITION Draws a cross at the center of the bounding box of each string's character. The character's angle, scale, and aspect ratio are taken into account. M_DRAW_STRING_CONTOUR Draws the contour of all the characters of the result(s) of the string(s) read. Note that this operation is only available if the results were obtained using a font-based context. The 2D graphics context cannot have its input units set to world units (MgraControl() with M_INPUT_UNITS set to M_WORLD) when drawing with this operation in either an image buffer or a 2D graphics list. If drawing in a zoomed and offset region, only integer values must be used (MgraControl() with M_DRAW_OFFSET_X, M_DRAW_OFFSET_Y, M_DRAW_ZOOM_X, and M_DRAW_ZOOM_Y set to integer values). Index Specifies the index of the font feature or result feature to draw. Set this parameter to one of the following values: For specifying the font or result Value Description M_DEFAULT Draws the default features for either fonts or results. For a String Reader context, the default value is the same as M_FONT_INDEX(). For a String Reader result, the default value is the same as M_ALL. M_FONT_INDEX( MIL_INT FontIndex ) Draws the features of a specific font. Note that this operation is only available if using a font-based context. Parameters FontIndex This parameter specifies the index of the font. Set this parameter to the following: M_ALL Specifies all fonts. 0 &lt;= Value &lt; M_NUMBER_OF_FONTS Specifies a specific font. M_ALL Draws the features of all results. Value &gt;= 0 Draws the features of a specific result. CharListPtr Accepts the following address: Data type: array of type char [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;char&gt; ] Required array size:() Data type: array of type short [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;short&gt; ] Required array size:() Data type: Set this parameter to M_NULL Specifies an explicit list of valid characters to draw, at the specified position. This is an optional, null-terminated string. This parameter is not needed when drawing results and should be set to M_NULL. Characters will be drawn in the order given in the CharListPtr parameter. To draw the characters on multiple lines, a space character must be inserted to separate the strings included in the null-terminated terminated string. The array of strings must be of the right type for the encoding scheme selected (MstrControl() with M_ENCODING). At preprocessing time, each character in an explicit character list must exist in at least one of the fonts of the constraint. ControlFlag Specifies where in the destination image buffer to draw. For a String Reader result, this parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. For a String Reader context, set this parameter to one of the following values: For specifying where to draw Value Description M_DEFAULT Draws characters from the center of the top-left pixel of the destination image buffer; or, if drawing in a 2D graphics list, from the center of the top-left pixel of the image used at the time of annotation. M_ORIGINAL Draws characters at the same offset as their original position in the definition image, for user-defined characters (set using MstrEditFont() with M_USER_DEFINED). Note that characters that are not user-defined (for example, TrueType) will be drawn at an offset of 0. To ascertain where user-defined characters are located in the definition image, you must draw the user-defined characters in an overlay on top of the definition image. That is to say, you must draw the characters on top of their original location. For more information, refer to M_DEFINITION_OFFSET_X and M_DEFINITION_OFFSET_Y in MstrInquire().

Param3Ptr Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): M_NULL MIL_CONST_TEXT_PTR [optionally, in C++: a reference to a MIL_STRING] Specifies the address of the value that will be used to edit the font. The value is dependent on the operation and mode chosen. Set this parameter to M_NULL if not used. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Parameter associations The table below lists possible values for the Operation, OperationMode, Param1, Param2Ptr, and Param3Ptr parameters. For performing the operation To specify the operation to perform, set the Operation, OperationMode, Param1, Param2Ptr, and Param3Ptr parameters to the following values: For performing the operation Operation Description OperationMode Param1 Param2Ptr Param3Ptr M_CHAR_ADD Adds character(s) to the font. M_SYSTEM_FONT Specifies that characters from a given system font (for example, TrueType and Postscript) will be added. Param1 Specifies the size of the characters to add. Value &gt; 6 Specifies the size, in points. Param2Ptr Data type info: Data type: array of type char [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;char&gt; ] &nbsp;|&nbsp; array of type short [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;short&gt; ] MORE Data type: array of type char [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;char&gt; ] Required array size: MstrInquire ( M_NUMBER_OF_CHARS ) Note: Applies when MstrControl() with M_ENCODING is set to M_ASCII. Data type: array of type short [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;short&gt; ] Required array size: MstrInquire ( M_NUMBER_OF_CHARS ) Note: Applies when MstrControl() with M_ENCODING is set to M_UNICODE. Specifies an optional string containing all of the characters to add. Two characters in one font cannot have the same value. If you try to add a character with a value that already exists in a font, the existing character will be replaced by the newly added one, unless you use M_NO_OVERWRITE. For more information, see the combination constants tables below. M_NULL Specifies that the standard characters of the font will be added. That is, A to Z, a to z, and 0 to 9. \"String\" Specifies the string. This must be a null-terminated string. Param3Ptr Data type info: Data type: address of a MIL_CONST_TEXT_PTR [optionally, in C++: MIL_STRING ] Data type: address of a MIL_CONST_TEXT_PTR [optionally, in C++: MIL_STRING ] Note: When using C++, you can pass a reference to a MIL_STRING instead. Specifies the following. MIL_TEXT(\"System font file name\") 1 Specifies the string containing the font's file name (for example, \"TrueType\" and \"Postscript\"). This must be a null-terminated string. M_USER_DEFINED Specifies that user-defined characters will be added from a given image to the specified font. Param1 Specifies the identifier of the image containing the characters to add. Image identifier Specifies the image identifier. The characters to add in the image must all be approximately the same size. You cannot add a character that is smaller than 6x6 pixels. Note that the size of the characters is automatically determined from the image. The characters in the image are taken from left to right and from top to bottom and are associated with the corresponding characters given in the character list. Each character in the image must be entirely connected (except for the accentuated characters) and should not be merged with other characters or other image objects. It is best to provide a character definition image that is of good quality, and that ideally contains only the characters that you want to add to the font (though this is not mandatory). If all the characters in the string you want to add cannot be found in the image, an error is returned. Even if the operation succeeds, you should draw the characters of the font to ensure that every character is defined as expected, using MstrDraw(). The image must be of type 1-band, 8-bit, unsigned. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Param2Ptr Data type info: Data type: array of type char [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;char&gt; ] &nbsp;|&nbsp; array of type short [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;short&gt; ] MORE Data type: array of type char [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;char&gt; ] Required array size: MstrInquire ( M_NUMBER_OF_CHARS ) Note: Applies when MstrControl() with M_ENCODING is set to M_ASCII. Data type: array of type short [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;short&gt; ] Required array size: MstrInquire ( M_NUMBER_OF_CHARS ) Note: Applies when MstrControl() with M_ENCODING is set to M_UNICODE. Specifies a string that identifies the character values to associate with the character representations in the image specified in the Param1 parameter. Unlike M_SYSTEM_FONT, this setting is not optional. \"String\" Specifies the string. This must be a null-terminated string. Two characters in one font cannot have the same value. If you try to add a character with a value that already exists in a font, the existing character will be replaced by the newly added one, unless you use M_NO_OVERWRITE. For more information, see the combination constants tables below. For a multi-string definition image, the space character (ASCII 32) must be inserted to separate the strings included in this null-terminated string. You should separate the string when one (or more) of the following situations is encountered: the characters are not all on the same line, the contrast is clearly different between characters, there is clearly a horizontal space between the characters (for example, ABC DEF). Param3Ptr Data type info: Data type: Set this parameter to M_NULL Data type: Set this parameter to M_NULL This parameter must be set to M_NULL. M_USER_DEFINED + M_SINGLE Specifies that the whole image will be used to define a single user-defined character in the specified font. This allows you to define special characters, which are not necessarily connected. The image is associated with the character specified by the Param2Ptr parameter. It is best to provide a character definition image that is of good quality. Note that if the character you want to add already exists in the font, the new character will replace the old one. You cannot add a character that is smaller than 6x6 pixels. By default, user-defined characters have no baseline. Param1 Specifies the identifier of the image containing the characters to add. The image must be of type 1-band, 8-bit, unsigned. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Param2Ptr Data type info: Data type: address of a char &nbsp;|&nbsp; address of a short MORE Data type: address of a char Note: Applies when MstrControl() with M_ENCODING is set to M_ASCII. Data type: address of a short Note: Applies when MstrControl() with M_ENCODING is set to M_UNICODE. Specifies the pointer of the character to add. Param3Ptr Data type info: Data type: Set this parameter to M_NULL Data type: Set this parameter to M_NULL This parameter must be set to M_NULL. M_CHAR_BASELINE Sets the baseline of the characters in the font. M_DEFAULT Implements the default behavior. By default, for system fonts (M_SYSTEM_FONT), the baseline will be taken from that font's file. By default, for user-defined fonts (M_USER_DEFINED), the baseline will be set to M_AUTO_COMPUTE, which automatically computes the baseline to an appropriate value. When using a font to read a string model, the baseline of all characters in the string model are expected to be aligned together within a certain degree of tolerance (set using MstrControl() with M_CHAR_MAX_BASELINE_DEVIATION), otherwise the string will not be read. Param1 Specifies the baseline. M_AUTO_COMPUTE Specifies that the baseline will be automatically computed to an appropriate value. M_NONE Specifies no baseline. -1000 &lt;= Value &lt;= 1000 Specifies the baseline value, as a percentage of the character's height. The position of the baseline in a character is defined as a percentage of the height of the character. That is, 0 refers to the bottom of character, 100 refers to the top of the character, and 50 refers to the middle of character. For example, in \"ABCD\", you would typically set the baseline to 0 for all characters, while in \"pobq\", you would typically set the baseline to 0 for \"ob\" and approximately 25 for \"pq\". Note that you can set a baseline value that falls outside the limits of the character's height (Y-size).

Retrieve results using MstrGetResult(); this function returns error and/or warning codes for problems found. Use MstrInquire() to retrieve the meaning associated with these codes. When the diagnosis of the String Reader context does not cause a general error (see MstrGetResult() with M_GENERAL), the context is ready to be used to read the image provided to MstrExpert(). You can call MstrExpert() multiple times to find and correct problems in the context. You can limit the verify operation to a region of the image buffer, using a rectangular ROI set with MbufSetRegion(). Note that this function is only available for a font-based context. Parameters Parameters ContextId Specifies the identifier of the String Reader context. The String Reader context must have been previously allocated on the required system using MstrAlloc(). ImageArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type char [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;char&gt; ] array of type MIL_ID [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_ID&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NbImages) array of type short [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;short&gt; ] Specifies the identifier of the image to analyze. Note that you cannot provide more than one image. This image buffer can only have a rectangular region of interest (ROI) defined using MbufSetRegion() (with or without rotation). In addition, the region must be defined in vector format from a 2D graphics list (M_VECTOR or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error will be generated if the ROI is only in raster format (M_RASTER) or a non-rectangular shape.

Results are only available after calling MstrRead(). When retrieving results, you will need to know the required type and size of the array in which to store the results. Typically, the default data type is MIL_DOUBLE. For certain results (such as, M_TEXT, M_FORMATTED_STRING, and M_STRING), the default type of the required array depends on the selected encoding scheme (MstrControl() with M_ENCODING). You can specify any data type by explicitly adding it to the result. The size of the array depends on the result type. Unless otherwise specified, the value settings are applicable to both font based and fontless contexts. If your target image (MstrRead()) was associated with a camera calibration context, positional and dimensional results are, by default, returned with respect to the relative coordinate system of the image. Otherwise, these results are returned in pixels, relative to the center of top-left pixel in the target image. If your target image was associated with a camera calibration context but you want to retrieve positional and dimensional results in pixel units, use MstrControl() with the M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS control type set to M_PIXEL. However, if you set M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS to M_WORLD without specifying a calibrated image in which to calculate the results, MstrGetResult() generates an error. Parameters Parameters ResultId Specifies the identifier of the String Reader result buffer from which to retrieve results. Index Specifies where to get results. This parameter can be set to one of the following: For specifying where to get results Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_ALL. M_ALL Specifies that the results of all strings will be retrieved.

This includes all string characters, the inserted space characters, the string separators, and the terminating null character (\"\\0\"). Strings are ordered in the natural Latin-based reading order. A space character is inserted in the text each time the distance between two adjacent characters exceeds the space width, at the scale of the string. The inserted space character can be set using MstrControl() with M_SPACE_CHARACTER. By default, the inserted space character is a space (ASCII code 32). Note that a string separator is inserted between different strings when getting all strings simultaneously. The string separator can be set using MstrControl() with M_STRING_SEPARATOR. By default, the string separator is a new line (ASCII code 10). Refer to M_STRING to retrieve the strings without separators. Refer to M_FORMATTED_STRING to retrieve the formatted string.

When retrieving transformation coefficient results for individual characters of a string, the ResultType parameter can be set to one of the following values. Transformation coefficients allow you to transform any point from the character's source image (the image from which the characters were defined) to its corresponding position in the target image (forward), or from the read position in the target image to its corresponding position in the character's source image (reverse). This is done using the following equations: x d = A x s + B y s + C y d = D x s + E y s + F where A, B, C, D, E, and F are the transformation coefficients (forward or reverse); x s and y s specify the source coordinates (character image for forward transformation or target image for reverse transformation); and, x d and y d specify the destination coordinates (target image for forward transformation or character image for reverse transformation).

Syntax void MstrPreprocess( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function prepares the specified String Reader context, font, and string model to be read. This function must be called before the first call to MstrRead(). Changes to control settings, the String Reader context, one of its font or string models often require you to re-preprocess the context. To inquire if you need to preprocess or re-preprocess the context, use MstrInquire() with M_PREPROCESSED. In a typical application, MstrPreprocess() is called once. To preprocess a String Reader context without error, the context must have at least one font, one character, and one string model. When you save a String Reader context, the preprocessing changes are not saved. Upon restoration, you must preprocess the context again. Parameters Parameters ContextId Specifies the String Reader context to preprocess. The String Reader context must have been previously allocated on the system using MstrAlloc(). ControlFlag Specifies whether to preprocess the String Reader context. Set this parameter to one of the following values: For specifying whether to preprocess the context Value Description M_DEFAULT Preprocesses the String Reader context.

Syntax void MstrRead( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;TargetImageId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;ResultId //in ) Description This function reads one or more strings from the specified target image using the specified String Reader context. All specifications, such as the number of strings to read in the target image, the speed and/or robustness settings, the constraints on the characters in the string, and the font used, depend on the settings of the String Reader context, which can be set using MstrControl(), MstrSetConstraint() and MstrEditFont(). All settings are taken into account by MstrRead(), and results are stored in the specified result buffer. Results can be read from the result buffer using the MstrGetResult() function. For a string to be read, it must not only meet all of the restrictions placed on it by the String Reader context, but it must also obey the basic rules of a string. That is, it must be a linear sequence of regular characters. The string read will be ordered in the natural Latin-based reading order. The position of a string is the position of the center of the bounding box of its first character. You can limit the read operation to a region of the image buffer, using a rectangular ROI set with MbufSetRegion(). The target image must be 1-band 8-bit unsigned, and cannot exceed a maximum size of 65536x65536 pixels. Note that before performing a read operation, the String Reader context must have at least one font, one character, and one string; it must also be preprocessed (MstrPreprocess()). If your target image was associated with a camera calibration context, positional and dimensional results are, by default, returned with respect to the relative coordinate system of the image. Otherwise, these results are returned in pixels, relative to the center of top-left pixel in the target image. If your target image was associated with a camera calibration context but you want to retrieve positional and dimensional results in pixel units, use MstrControl() with the M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS control type set to M_PIXEL. However, if you set M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS to M_WORLD without specifying a calibrated image in which to calculate the results, MstrGetResult() generates an error. In the presence of distortion, some results are meaningless when converted from real-world to pixel units (such as angle and scale). For example, if a string appears warped in the target image, but the camera calibration context compensates for this, the resulting angle is meaningful in the real-world coordinate system, and meaningless in the pixel coordinate system. If complex distortions exist, correct the image before using it with MstrRead(). Parameters Parameters ContextId Specifies the String Reader context to use for the read operation. The String Reader context must have been previously allocated on the required system using MstrAlloc(), and preprocessed using MstrPreprocess(). TargetImageId Specifies the target image in which to read the strings. This image buffer can only have a rectangular region of interest (ROI) defined using MbufSetRegion() (with or without rotation). In addition, the region must be defined in vector format from a 2D graphics list (M_VECTOR or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error will be generated if the ROI is only in raster format (M_RASTER) or a non-rectangular shape. ResultId Specifies the result buffer in which to write the results of the read operation.

Syntax MIL_ID MstrRestore( MIL_CONST_TEXT_PTR&nbsp;FileName, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*ContextIdPtr //out ) Description This function restores a String Reader context that was previously saved to a file, using MstrSave() or MstrStream(). This function restores all of the String Reader context's settings (including font and string model settings) that were in effect when the String Reader context was saved. A restored String Reader context is not preprocessed; therefore, you must call MstrPreprocess() before performing a read with MstrRead(). To use a fontless context, you must restore one of the predefined context files distributed with MIL (such as, \"C:\\Program Files\\Matrox Imaging\\contexts\\FONTLESS_ANPR.msr\"). When the restored String Reader context is no longer required, release it using MstrFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during restoration; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the restored String Reader context's lifetime and you must not manually free it. Parameters Parameters FileName Specifies the path and name of the file from which to restore the String Reader context (for example, \"C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). The function handles (internally) the opening and closing of the file. The predefined context files, distributed with MIL, are in the \"C:\\Program Files\\Matrox Imaging\\contexts\\FONTLESS_ANPR.msr\" folder. To open the file on the remote computer (under Distributed MIL), prefix the specified file name string with \"remote:///\" (for example, \"remote:///C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). This parameter can be set to one of the following: For specifying the file name and path Value Description M_INTERACTIVE [This is only applicable to Windows] Opens the File Open dialog box from which you can interactively specify the drive, directory, and name of the file. MIL_TEXT(\"FONTLESS_ANPR.msr\") 1 Specifies to restore a generic String Reader context useful to read license plates. MIL_TEXT(\"FONTLESS_EUROPEAN_ANPR.msr\") 1 Specifies to restore a String Reader context useful to read European license plates. MIL_TEXT(\"FONTLESS_MACHINE_PRINT.msr\") 1 Specifies to restore a special String Reader context that reads machine printed characters in Arial, OCR-B, or other sans-serif fonts. 1 If you are passing the value in a variable, don't enclose it in MIL_TEXT(). SysId Specifies the system on which to restore the String Reader context. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the system identifier Value Description M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. ContextIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the String Reader context identifier or specifies the data type that the function should use to return the String Reader context identifier. For retrieving the identifier or specifying how to return it Value Description M_NULL Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated String Reader context ; in this case, a standard MIL identifier of type MIL_ID is returned. M_UNIQUE_ID Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated String Reader context ; in this case, a MIL smart identifier of type MIL_UNIQUE_STR_ID is returned instead of a standard MIL identifier. This setting is only available when using C++11 (or later). A MIL smart identifier manages the lifespan of the MIL object it owns (similar to a std::unique_ptr). Note, you can use a MIL smart identifier as though it were a standard MIL identifier, except that you cannot use it to manually free the String Reader context (it is freed automatically). For more information, see the MIL smart identifiers subsection of the MIL custom data types, void pointers, extensions, and portability functions section of Chapter 2: Building an application. Address in which to write the identifier Specifies the address of a MIL_ID in which to write the identifier of the restored String Reader context. If restoration fails, M_NULL is written as the identifier. Return value The returned value is the String Reader context identifier either as a standard identifier (MIL_ID) or a smart identifier (MIL_UNIQUE_STR_ID).

CharPos Specifies the character position in the string for which to set the constraint. A constraint can be set for any position, even a position greater than the maximum number of characters in the string. Constraints set at a position greater than the minimum number of characters in the string are ignored (when the string read does not contain a character at that position). This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the character position Value Description M_DEFAULT Sets the default constraint of the string model. The default constraint of the string model is used when no specific constraint is set to a given position. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 255 Sets the character position in the string to which to apply the constraint. ConstraintType Specifies the type of constraint to set. By default, all constraints apply to any font in the context. For example, M_LETTER + M_DIGIT means any letter and any digit of any font is acceptable. To restrict the constraint to a specific font, see the combination value below. For specifying the constraint Value Description M_DEFAULT Sets the constraint to the default constraint. For a specific character position (the CharPos parameter is set to an individual value), the default is the same as the default constraint of the string model. For the default character position (the CharPos parameter is set to M_DEFAULT), the default is the same as M_ANY. M_ANY Sets the constraint to any character. M_DIGIT Sets the constraint to any digit (0 to 9). M_DIGIT + M_LETTER Sets the constraint to any digit (0 to 9) and any letter (a to z and A to Z). M_LETTER Sets the constraint to any letter (a to z and A to Z). Note that M_LETTER does not differentiate between upper and lower cases. Combination values for M_DIGIT + M_LETTER , M_LETTER.

To inquire the number of bytes necessary to save a String Reader context to memory stream, you should first call this function (MstrStream()) with M_INQUIRE_SIZE_BYTE. The content saved to memory stream is equivalent to the content saved to file. This function is equivalent to a file saved using MstrSave(). You can use this and other MIL stream functions, for example, to save all required MIL objects, as well as any other custom data, for your application to a memory stream. Once in a memory stream, you can write the stream to a single file or transfer it over a network. You are responsible for concatenating the streams and for saving the stream to file. All information about the previously allocated String Reader context is saved, including all of the individual font and string settings. However, preprocessing changes are not saved. All of the String Reader context settings that were in effect when the String Reader context was saved will be restored. A loaded or restored String Reader context is not preprocessed, therefore you must call MstrPreprocess() before performing a read with MstrRead(). Using MstrStream(), you can choose to save a backwards-compatible version of the String Reader context, which will work using a version of MIL that is up to one major release older than the current version (depending on which version is specified). For example, if you allocate a String Reader context using MIL 10.0 and save it to version 9.0, you can restore this context on a computer where MIL 9.0 is installed. However, all settings and features unique to the higher version will be ignored when restored using the lower version. Besides saving backwards-compatible versions, you can also load or restore String Reader contexts saved using MIL version 8.0 or above. Settings that do not exist in the lower version will be filled with default values when the String Reader context is loaded or restored. Parameters Parameters MemPtrOrFileName Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): MIL_TEXT_PTR [optionally, in C++: a reference to a MIL_STRING] Optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector of type MIL_UINT8 Specifies the file or memory stream.

M_PROC_VERSION_100_PP3 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0 Processing Pack 3. M_PROC_VERSION_100_SP4 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0 Service Pack 4. M_PROC_VERSION_100_SP5 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0 Service Pack 5. M_PROC_VERSION_100_SP6 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0 Service Pack 6. M_PROC_VERSION_100_SP7 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0 Service Pack 7. ContextStrIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable containing the identifier of the String Reader context. M_LOAD Loads the content of a specified file or memory stream into a previously allocated String Reader context. MemPtrOrFileName Specifies the file or memory stream from which to load the context. M_INTERACTIVE [This is only applicable to Windows] Opens a dialog box from which you can interactively specify the drive, directory, and name of the file, when the StreamType parameter is set to M_FILE. MIL_TEXT(\"FileName\") 1 Specifies the drive, directory, and name of the file (for example, \"C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"), when the StreamType parameter is set to M_FILE. String Reader contexts typically have an MSR file extension. The function handles (internally) the opening and closing of the file. To specify a file on a remote computer (under Distributed MIL), prefix the specified file name string with \"remote:///\" (for example, \"remote:///C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). MemPtr Specifies the address of the block of memory, when the StreamType parameter is set to M_MEMORY. The block of memory should be of type MIL_UINT8. The specified address must correspond to the first memory address in which the object is located, and the block of memory must contain the entire object. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler), you must cast the MIL_UINT8 pointer to a MIL_TEXT_PTR. SysId This parameter must be set to M_NULL. Version This parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. ContextStrIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable containing the identifier of the String Reader context. All previous settings are overwritten with those of the loaded context, or are set to the default value if the settings didn't exist in the version of MIL from which the context is being loaded. M_RESTORE Restores a String Reader context from a file or memory stream and assigns it a MIL identifier. MemPtrOrFileName Specifies the file or memory stream from which to restore the context. M_INTERACTIVE [This is only applicable to Windows] Opens a dialog box from which you can interactively specify the drive, directory, and name of the file, when the StreamType parameter is set to M_FILE. MIL_TEXT(\"FileName\") 1 Specifies the drive, directory, and name of the file (for example, \"C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"), when the StreamType parameter is set to M_FILE. String Reader contexts typically have an MSR file extension. The function handles (internally) the opening and closing of the file. To specify a file on a remote computer (under Distributed MIL), prefix the specified file name string with \"remote:///\" (for example, \"remote:///C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). MemPtr Specifies the address of the block of memory, when the StreamType parameter is set to M_MEMORY. The block of memory should be of type MIL_UINT8. The specified address must correspond to the first memory address in which the object is located, and the block of memory must contain the entire object. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler), you must cast the MIL_UINT8 pointer to a MIL_TEXT_PTR. SysId Specifies the system on which to allocate the String Reader context. M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). Version This parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. ContextStrIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the identifier of the String Reader context. If the operation is not successful, M_NULL is returned. M_SAVE Saves a String Reader context to a specified file or memory stream. MemPtrOrFileName Specifies the file or memory stream. M_INTERACTIVE [This is only applicable to Windows] Opens a dialog box from which you can interactively specify the drive, directory, and name of the file, when the StreamType parameter is set to M_FILE. MIL_TEXT(\"FileName\") 1 Specifies the drive, directory, and name of the file (for example, \"C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"), when the StreamType parameter is set to M_FILE. For easier use with other Matrox Imaging software products, when saving a string reader context to a file, use the MSR file extension. The function handles (internally) the opening and closing of the file. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. To specify a file on a remote computer (under Distributed MIL), prefix the specified file name string with \"remote:///\" (for example, \"remote:///C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). MemPtr Specifies the address of the block of memory, when the StreamType parameter is set to M_MEMORY. The block of memory should be of type MIL_UINT8. The specified address must correspond to the first memory address in which to write, and the block of memory must be large enough to stream the entire object. To determine the required size, call this function with M_INQUIRE_SIZE_BYTE. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler), you must cast the MIL_UINT8 pointer to a MIL_TEXT_PTR. SysId This parameter must be set to M_NULL. Version Specifies the MIL version with which the String Reader context must be compatible when saved. Note that the String Reader context can only be up to one major release older (MIL 9.0) than the current version. M_DEFAULT Specifies the current version of MIL. M_PROC_VERSION_90 Specifies the version as being MIL 9.0. M_PROC_VERSION_90_PP1 Specifies the version as being MIL 9.0 Processing Pack 1. M_PROC_VERSION_90_PP2 Specifies the version as being MIL 9.0 Processing Pack 2. M_PROC_VERSION_100 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0. M_PROC_VERSION_100_PP1 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0 Processing Pack 1. M_PROC_VERSION_100_PP2 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0 Processing Pack 2. M_PROC_VERSION_100_PP3 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0 Processing Pack 3. M_PROC_VERSION_100_SP4 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0 Service Pack 4. M_PROC_VERSION_100_SP5 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0 Service Pack 5. M_PROC_VERSION_100_SP6 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0 Service Pack 6. M_PROC_VERSION_100_SP7 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0 Service Pack 7. ContextStrIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable containing the identifier of the String Reader context to save. 1 If you are passing the value in a variable, don't enclose it in MIL_TEXT().

      "text": " Using Matrox Radient eV with MIL To use Matrox Radient eV, you must allocate it as a MIL Radient eV system (using MsysAlloc() with M_SYSTEM_RADIENTEVCL or M_SYSTEM_RADIENTCXP, depending on the version of the board). This allocation opens communications with your Matrox Radient eV and allows MIL to use its resources. For Matrox Radient eV-CL, you can allocate a MIL Radient eV-CL system for your board in multiple processes (executables). If more than one process allocates a digitizer for the same acquisition path, grabs from the different processes will be queued in the order that they arrive (first in, first out). For Matrox Radient eV-CXP, you can allocate a MIL Radient eV system for your board in multiple processes (executables). However, multiple processes cannot allocate a digitizer for the same acquisition path. Matrox Radient eV features at least one quadrature decoder that can decode input from a linear or rotary encoder with quadrature output. For more information on this feature, refer to the Using quadrature input from a rotary encoder section of Chapter 56: I/O signals and communicating with external devices. This chapter also provides information on how to configure and use the I/O signals. Matrox Radient eV provides a GenICam CLProtocol driver to communicate with your Camera Link camera using the GenICam SFNC standard. For information regarding using MIL to access the GenICam SFNC-compatible features of your camera, see the Using MIL with GenICam section of Chapter 27: Grabbing with your digitizer. Refer to the Matrox Radient eV release notes for any additions/modifications to the MIL Hardware-specific Notes in this chapter or in the MIL Reference. Grabbing and the MIL buffer formats to use for each camera pixel format on Matrox Radient eV-CXP For Matrox Radient eV-CXP, the following table outlines which MIL buffer format to use with each supported camera pixel format. Note that these are the officially supported camera pixel formats for Matrox Radient eV-CXP. Camera pixel format 1 MIL buffer format (type and attribute) Operation Mono8, Mono10, Mono12, Mono14, Mono16, Mono32 1-band 8-bit, 1-band 16-bit, 1-band 32-bit, 3-band 8-bit 2 , 3-band 16-bit 3 Data will automatically be bit-shifted to have most-significant bits (MSB) in destination buffer BayerXX8, BayerXX10, BayerXX12, BayerXX14, BayerXX16 where XX = GR, GB, BG or RG 1-band 8-bit, 1-band 16-bit Demosaicing followed by RGB to Y (bit shift for MSB) 3-band 8-bit, 3-band 16-bit Demosaicing (bit shift for MSB) 3-band YUV16 + M_PACKED Demosaicing followed by RGB to YUV RGB8, RGBA8, 1-band 8-bit RGB to Y 3-band 8-bit Direct copy 3-band YUV16 + M_PACKED RGB to YUV RGB10, RGBA10, RGB12, RGBA12, RGB14, RGBA14, RGB16, RGBA16 1-band 8-bit RGB to Y (bit shift for MSB) 1-band 16-bit RGB to Y 3-band 16-bit M_PLANAR Packed destination buffers are not supported YUV422_8, YCbCr601_422_8, YCbCr709_422_8 1-band 8-bit Only Y component 3-band YUV16 + M_PACKED Direct copy 1 All of the values available for RGB are also available in BGR format. 2 3-band 8-bit buffers can be in any of the following formats: M_RGB24 + M_PLANAR, M_RGB24 + M_PACKED, M_BGR24 + M_PACKED, or M_BGR32 + M_PACKED. 3 3-band 16-bit buffers can be in either an M_RGB48 + M_PLANAR or M_RGB48 + M_PACKED format. Using the CoaXPress trigger signal on Matrox Radient eV-CXP The CoaXPress trigger signal is an embedded bidirectional signal transmitted along the physical transport layer connection of your camera. Typically, the CoaXPress trigger signal is reserved for trigger information and is sent with other control and data signals along the same cable. To use this signal as the source of a trigger to grab an image, use MdigControl() with M_GRAB_TRIGGER_SOURCE set to M_TL_TRIGGER. Then, program your triggered grab according to your requirements. The grab will now be triggered based on the CoaXPress trigger signal being sent to your digitizer. To use this signal to trigger the camera, use MdigControl() with M_IO_SOURCE + M_TL_TRIGGER set to the appropriate auxiliary input signals (for example, M_AUX_IO4). Note that when you set the camera to capture an image only upon a trigger, you should disable grab triggered mode on the frame grabber (M_GRAB_TRIGGER_STATE set to M_DISABLE). For more information on performing a triggered grab, see the Grabbing with triggers section of Chapter 27: Grabbing with your digitizer. Performing Bayer color conversion in hardware When Matrox Radient eV boards grab color images from a video source with a Bayer color filter (as specified by the DCF), it performs Bayer color conversion in hardware, as it transfers the images to the Host. If the images require white balancing, Matrox Radient eV boards can perform this automatically if white balancing is enabled using MdigControl() with M_WHITE_BALANCE set to M_ENABLE. If performing white balancing, you can use the default white balance coefficients, automatically have them calculated (using MdigControl() with M_WHITE_BALANCE set to M_CALCULATE), or set explicit coefficients (M_BAYER_COEFFICIENTS_ID). For information on Bayer color conversion, refer to the Using images acquired with a Bayer color filter section of Chapter 23: Data buffers. If you don't want to perform Bayer color conversion in hardware, disable it using MdigControl() with M_BAYER_CONVERSION set to M_DISABLE. The M_BAYER... control types of MdigControl() can only be used when grabbing from a camera that has a Bayer color filter (as specified by the DCF); otherwise, an error will be generated. Using frame burst with a multi-frame buffer All version of Matrox Radient eV-CL and Matrox Radient eV-CXP support frame burst technology. This technology allows you to grab a group of sequential frames into a multi-frame buffer with one grab command (MdigGrab(), or one grab of MdigProcess()); the defined number of frames are stored contiguously in the same buffer. The end-of-grab event only occurs once the entire group of frames has been grabbed, reducing the number of events that need to be handled. This is useful in cases where you have a high frame rate and need to ensure that no frames are missed. Note that a user-defined function hooked to the end-of-grab event (MdigProcess(), or MdigHookFunction() with M_GRAB_END) is executed only once the entire group of frames has been grabbed. For information on creating a multi-frame image buffer to store sequential frames, see the Specifying the dimensions of a multi-frame image buffer subsection of the Specifying the dimensions of a data buffer section of Chapter 23: Data buffers. Using on-board flat-field correction Matrox Radient eV-CL and Matrox Radient eV-CXP Quad CXP-6 for 3D profiling support flat-field correction on-board without Host intervention. Images taken in environments with uneven lighting can affect the quality of your processing. To correct this, an on-board flat-field correction can be applied to images so that the intensity across the image is even before processing begins. To use flat-field correction, you need to specify an on-board buffer that contains the gain values, and optionally another that contains the offset values, using MdigControl() with M_SHADING_CORRECTION_GAIN_ID and M_SHADING_CORRECTION_OFFSET_ID, respectively. The buffers should be the same size as the grabbed image, and the gain values should be in the specified fixed point format (M_SHADING_CORRECTION_GAIN_FIXED_POINT). The aggregate bandwidth to read the gain buffer and offset buffer from on-board memory cannot be bigger than the internal maximum bandwidth of the DMA port. There is a line limitation of 64 K pixels per line and 1 M lines per frame. Once you have set the buffers, enable the correction using MdigControl() with M_SHADING_CORRECTION. Note that for Matrox Radient eV-CL, flat-field correction is not supported on Matrox Radient eV-CL SB. Note that for Matrox Radient eV-CXP, flat-field correction is only available on Matrox Radient eV-CXP Quad CXP-6 for 3D profiling with the appropriate firmware installed. Extracting peaks from an on-board multi-frame image buffer Matrox Radeint eV-CXP Quad CXP for 3D profiling can perform MimLocatePeak1d() on-board without Host intervention if the specified buffer is an on-board buffer. This functionality is only available on this version of Matrox Radient eV-CXP. Supporting this function on-board allows the board to perform sheet of light (laser line) extraction. The sheet of light must appear horizontally in the image. The board can extract more than one peak per lane (up to 3). In addition, the board can operate on a single frame or multi-frame on-board image buffer. For more information on how to use MimLocatePeak1d() for peak extraction from a multi-frame image buffer, see the Extraction of peaks from a multi-frame buffer subsection of the Peak intensity detection and depth maps section of Chapter 5: Specialized image processing.

      "text": " Allocating independent MIL digitizers on Matrox Radient eV boards You can allocate up to 4 independent MIL digitizers on your Matrox Radient eV-CL and Matrox Radient eV-CXP (depending on the version), using MdigAlloc(). Independent digitizers have different device numbers and use different acquisition paths. Matrox Radient eV-CL The number of independent digitizers that you can allocate on Matrox Radient ev-CL is dependent on the version in use: Matrox Radient eV-CL DB has 2 acquisition paths (M_DEV0 and M_DEV1). Matrox Radient eV-CL QB has 4 acquisition paths (M_DEV0 to M_DEV3). With both Matrox Radient eV-CL DB and QB, each acquisition path supports a video source in the Camera Link Base configuration. Matrox Radient ev-CL SF has only 1 acquisition path (M_DEV0). Matrox Radient eV-CL DF has 2 acquisition paths (M_DEV0 to M_DEV1). With both Matrox Radient eV-CL SF and DF, each acquisition path supports a video source in the Camera Link Medium, Full, or 80-bit configuration. Matrox Radient eV-CXP You must allocate a digitizer for each CoaXPress link (CXP link). A CXP link contains all the connections and components to capture from 1 video source. Matrox Radient eV-CXP Dual supports 2 links, whereas Matrox Radient eV-CXP Quad supports 4 links. When connecting a video source with multiple connections to Matrox Radient eV-CXP, the master connection determines which device number should be used when allocating your digitizer. For example, if the master connector is plugged into CXP 0, use M_DEV0 to allocate the digitizer. If, however, the master connector is plugged into CXP 3, use M_DEV3 to allocate the digitizer. The other connectors for the same video source (called extension connectors) combine with the master connection to form a CXP link. Both of the following configurations depict two CXP links, each with a master connection and an extension connection. In configuration 1, you should allocate a digitizer for video source 1 using M_DEV0; whereas, you should allocate a digitizer for video source 2 using M_DEV2. In configuration 2, you should allocate a digitizer for video source 1 using M_DEV0; whereas, you should allocate a digitizer for video source 2 using M_DEV1. Configuration 2 has a slight speed advantage to configuration 1 when the digitizer initializes, since the available devices will be scanned for initialization from 0 to 3.

      "text": " Minimum latency and grabbing all frames When grabbing with either MdigGrab() or MdigProcess(), Matrox Radient eV is optimized to have the smallest latency possible between the last pixel sent from the camera to the last pixel written into the buffer. This allows the buffer to be available for processing with a minimum amount of delay. By default, Matrox Radient eV grabs into buffers in Host memory. On-board memory is used to protect against PCIe latency. To perform real-time grabs, your rate of acquisition (grabbing bandwidth) must be lower than the PCIe maximum transfer rate (PCIe bandwidth). If the acquisition rate is higher than the transfer rate across the PCIe bus, frames will be skipped rather than allowing a grab over-run to occur. To determine the image transfer speed from Matrox Radient eV to the Host, use the Matrox Radient eV Bench utility. Detecting missed frames To be certain that no frames were missed when MdigProcess() was last used, use MdigInquire() with M_PROCESS_FRAME_MISSED. This value reads the number of frames that were transmitted by the camera when no buffer was available to receive the frame; for example, if a grab is triggered and the associated hooked function is slow, then a frame can be missed. Efficiently copying an on-board buffer to a destination buffer in Host memory When copying an on-board buffer into a destination buffer in Host memory, the copy operation is performed by your Matrox Radient eV using the board's DMA write engine, rather than the Host. Your Matrox Radient eV will perform the operation faster than the Host. To ensure that Matrox Radient eV performs the operation, use the following: To copy an on-board buffer into a destination buffer in Host memory, use MbufCopy(). To resize an on-board buffer while copying it to a destination buffer in Host memory, use MimResize() with a factor of 1/n, where n is a value between 1 to 16, and with an interpolation mode of M_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR. Alternatively, you can use MbufTransfer() to perform the same operation. To flip an on-board buffer while copying it to a destination buffer in Host memory, use MimFlip(). Note that for your Matrox Radient eV to perform these operations, the destination buffer must be allocated in non-paged memory (that is, using MbufAlloc...() with + M_IMAGE + M_NON_PAGED). Efficiently converting buffer formats while copying When copying an on-board buffer into a destination buffer in Host memory, the color space converter and image formatter can automatically convert the bit-depth and color format of the source buffer to the bit-depth and color format of the destination buffer. For on-board conversion of buffers to take place, the following on-board buffer and destination buffer depth and color formats are supported. On-board buffer depth and color format (specified in the DCF) Destination buffer depth and color format 8-bit monochrome 16-bit monochrome M_PACKED + M_BGR24 M_PACKED + M_BGR32 M_YUV16_YUYV / M_YUV16 M_PLANAR + M_RGB24 M_PLANAR + M_RGB48 8-bit monochrome Yes No Yes Yes Yes Yes No 16-bit monochrome Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes M_PACKED + M_BGR24 Yes No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes M_RGB48 + M_PACKED Yes Yes No No No Yes Yes For information about YUV or RGB/BGR buffers, refer to Chapter 23: Data buffers.

      "text": " Using Matrox Radient eV data latches All version of Matrox Radient eV-CL and Matrox Radient eV-CXP have data latches to store signal state information, the quadrature decoder's counter value, or a timestamp at a specific point during a grab. Data latches are reset at every end of grabbed frame event. Data latches do not suffer the delays typical to hooking a hook-handler function to these specific points during the grab and inquiring and storing related information using software. Data latches are only available when using a MIL digitizer allocated using MdigAlloc() with M_DEV0 or M_DEV1. Matrox Radient eV has 16 data latches for use with a digitizer allocated with M_DEV0 and 16 data latches for use with a digitizer allocated with M_DEV1. You can specify the data latch trigger source and the data to record upon the trigger using MdigControl() with the M_DATA_LATCH... control types. To retrieve data from a data latch, use MdigGetHookInfo() with M_DATA_LATCH.... Steps to configure and retrieve data from a data latch The following steps provide a basic methodology for configuring and retrieving data from a data latch: Specify what triggers storing the specified information to the specified data latch, using MdigControl() with M_DATA_LATCH_TRIGGER_SOURCE + M_LATCHn. The trigger can be a specific auxiliary signal, a quadrature decoder's counter value, a timer active event, or one of a limited number of grab events (such as a start of frame event). If necessary, specify the trigger signal transition upon which to store the information, using M_DATA_LATCH_TRIGGER_ACTIVATION + M_LATCHn. Note that this is only useful when M_DATA_LATCH_TRIGGER_SOURCE + M_LATCHn is set to M_AUX_IOn or M_TIMER_ACTIVE. Specify the type of information to store, using M_DATA_LATCH_TYPE + M_LATCHn. Note that a data latch can store only 1 type of information, and each type of information can only be associated with 1 data latch, except for timestamp, which can be associated with up to 4 data latches. MIL returns an error when this limitation is not respected. To latch data before the start of the first grabbed frame, set M_DATA_LATCH_MODE + M_LATCHn to M_PREFETCH. Otherwise, if the data latch is triggered before the start of the first grabbed frame, no information is stored. To latch data only once the grab has started (that is, as of the start of the first grabbed frame), set M_DATA_LATCH_MODE to M_DEFAULT; this is the default value. Enable the data latch using M_DATA_LATCH_STATE set to M_ENABLE. If necessary, repeat steps 1 to 5 for each data latch used. Perform the grab. You can use MdigProcess() to grab an image; in the hook-handler function, retrieve and make use of the information stored in the data latch, using MdigGetHookInfo() with M_DATA_LATCH_VALUE. Alternatively, hook a hook-handler function to the end of grab frame event (M_GRAB_FRAME_END) using MdigHookFunction(), and call MdigGrab() to grab an image; then, to retrieve and make use of the information stored in the data latch, call MdigGetHookInfo() with M_DATA_LATCH_VALUE. When done, disable the data latches using MdigControl() with M_DATA_LATCH_STATE + M_LATCHn set to M_DISABLE. Triggering the data latch Data latches can store data at several different points during a grab. Below are a few events that can trigger a data latch. Callout # MdigControl() with M_DATA_LATCH_TRIGGER_SOURCE MdigControl() with M_DATA_LATCH_TRIGGER_ACTIVATION 1, 4, and 8 M_AUX_IOn M_EDGE_RISING 2, 5, and 9 M_TIMER_ACTIVE M_EDGE_RISING or M_EDGE_FALLING 3 and 7 M_GRAB_FRAME_START 6 and 10 M_GRAB_FRAME_END Events that occur before the start of the first grabbed frame of queued grabs or a grab sequence (such as, any auxiliary I/O change event, rotary decoder position change, or timer active event) can only trigger a data latch if the data latch has its mode set to prefetch (using MdigControl() with M_DATA_LATCH_MODE set to M_PREFETCH). In the above image, if the data latch mode is set to prefetch (using M_DATA_LATCH_MODE set to M_PREFETCH), reading the data latch at the end of frame 1 could return the information latched at captions 1 through 6, depending on which event triggers the data latch. However, if the data latch mode is set to default (M_DATA_LATCH_MODE to M_DEFAULT), reading the data latch at the end of frame 1 could only return captions 3 through 6. In both cases, reading the data latch at the end of frame 2 could return captions 7 though 10. Captions 5 and 6 are returned at the end of frame 1, even though they relate to frame 2 because the data of all enabled data latches is returned at the end of every grabbed frame end event (that is, at the end of each grabbed frame). If calls to MdigGrab() occur while no other grab is currently being performed and M_DATA_LATCH_MODE is set to M_PREFETCH, events that occur from the moment the grab command is issued until the start of the grabbed frame can also trigger a data latch and be retrieved at the end of the grabbed frame, for each MdigGrab() call. Callout # MdigControl() with M_DATA_LATCH_TRIGGER_SOURCE MdigControl() with M_DATA_LATCH_TRIGGER_ACTIVATION A and F M_AUX_IOn M_EDGE_RISING B and G M_TIMER_ACTIVE M_EDGE_RISING or M_EDGE_FALLING C and H M_GRAB_FRAME_START D and I M_GRAB_FRAME_END E No data can be latched during this period In the above image, if the data latch mode is set to M_PREFETCH, reading the data latch at the end of frame 1 could return the information latched at captions A through D, depending on which event triggers the data latch. In this example, no data latch can return information relating to events during caption E. Frame 2 could return the information latched at captions F through I. Note that, when using MdigProcess() or when queuing grabs using MdigGrab() in asynchronous mode, there is no dead zone. Data latch limitations To set the type of data that a data latch should store, use M_DATA_LATCH_TYPE. In most cases, you can set up only one data latch to record a specific type of data (for example, only one data latch can store the status of all I/O signals). The exceptions to this are data latches that store timestamps; you can set up four data latches to store timestamps. MIL returns an error when this limitation is not respected. Retrieving data latch information MIL allows each data latch to store multiple instances of the same type of data. You can retrieve a specific instance using the combination value M_VALUE_INDEX(). For example, when latching the timestamp at the end of each grabbed line of a frame with 1024 lines, to retrieve the 1024th timestamp, use MdigGetHookInfo() with M_DATA_LATCH_VALUE + M_LATCHn + M_VALUE_INDEX(1023), where n is the number associated with the data latch. To retrieve all the stored information associated with a specific data latch, use M_DATA_LATCH_VALUE_ALL + M_LATCHn. Using our previous example, this would return 1024 timestamps. To inquire how many pieces of information are stored inside a data latch, use M_DATA_LATCH_VALUE_COUNT. To convert a timestamp from clock ticks to seconds, use the following equation: Timestamp * ( TimestampFrequencyInHz). To inquire the clock frequency, use MdigInquire() with M_DATA_LATCH_CLOCK_FREQUENCY. Data latch example For an example of how to use data latches, refer to the DataLatch.cpp example.

      "text": " Matrox Radient eV utilities and tools There are three Matrox Radient eV external applications (utilities) available (Matrox Usage Meter, Matrox Performance Monitor, and Matrox Radient eV Bench) and a series of tools integrated in the MILConfig utility (such as, the PCIe Information tool and the System Monitor tool). To access these utilities and tools, launch the MILConfig utility. Then, expand the Boards item in the tree structure, click on the Radient eV-series subitem in the tree structure, and then select your board (eV-CL or eV-CXP). The utilities are located in the Launch external applications and Matrox Radient eV System Monitor pages, respectively. There is a version of each of these utilities and tools for each board-type, unless otherwise specified in the text below. Matrox Usage Meter utility The Matrox Usage Meter utility calculates how much of the grab section and the transfer section of each DMA engine is being used. This rate of utilization is expressed as a percentage. This utility also shows the usage of on-board memory. Matrox Radient eV Performance Monitor utility The Matrox Radient eV Performance Monitor utility is integrated in the Windows Performance Monitor utility and is used to monitor information about Matrox Radient eV, such as: Grab usage. Transfer usage of each DMA write engine. Memory size of the memory bank. Current and maximum temperatures of the FPGA. Matrox Radient eV Bench utility The Matrox Radient eV Bench utility calculates the real-time transfer speed of the PCIe slot (in Mbytes/sec) from: Matrox Radient eV to Host. Host to Matrox Radient eV. Matrox Radient eV PCIe Information tool The Matrox Radient eV PCIe Information tool returns information about the board's PCIe connector. Use the acquisition (device) selector to set the acquisition path about which to inquire (M_DEVn). Note that this selector is shared with the Matrox Radient eV System Monitor tool. This tool presents the following information inside the MILConfig utility: Current number of PCIe lanes. Current speed of the PCIe lanes. Maximum number of PCIe lanes. Maximum speed of the PCIe lanes. Matrox Radient eV System Monitor tool The Matrox Radient eV System Monitor tool displays board properties of the specified digitizer (M_DEVn). Use the acquisition (device) selector to set the acquisition path about which to inquire (M_DEVn). Note that this selector is shared with the Matrox Radient eV PCIe Information tool. This tool presents the following information inside the MILConfig utility: The grab FPGA's current temperature, shown on a sliding scale from 0 to 85 degrees Celsius. The speed of the fan on the board, in RPM. Whether a power source is detected on the internal auxiliary 12 V power connection, if available on the Matrox Radient eV board. If your Matrox Radient eV is operating in the normal range of temperatures, a check mark is presented at the bottom of the Matrox Radient eV System Monitor tool. If your Matrox Radient eV is operating above or below the normal range of temperatures, an X is presented. Matrox Radient eV-CL Deserializer setup tool The Matrox Radient eV-CL Deserializer setup tool finds the initial values needed for the deserializer alignment process when grabbing data. The values are determined for each Camera Link connection that is in-use. The resulting values are saved in the DCF, and help compensate for signal degradation. Note that we recommend using this tool only when using cables longer than 7 m and when acquired images are corrupted. For more information on using the Matrox Radient eV-CL Deserializer setup tool, refer to the Matrox Radient eV installation and hardware reference manual.

      "text": " Matrox Radient eV-CL SF/DF connectors and signal names This section serves as a reference to match Matrox Radient eV-CL SF and eV-CL DF's connectors and auxiliary signals with MIL information, such as MIL auxiliary/camera control signal numbers. To set/inquire all the settings for this board's auxiliary signals (for example, signal routing and timer settings), use MdigControl() / MdigInquire(), respectively. Matrox Radient eV-CL family members have a different number of acquisition paths and auxiliary/camera control signals. For each Matrox Radient eV-CL family member, only the auxiliary/camera control signals associated with the following digitizer device numbers are supported: Matrox Radient eV type Digitizer device # Matrox Radient eV-CL SF M_DEV0. Matrox Radient eV CL DF M_DEV0, M_DEV1. The following table lists the connectors of the auxiliary/control signals that can be used for each digitizer device number: Digitizer device # Matrox Radient eV-CL SF Matrox Radient eV-CL DF M_DEV0 Auxiliary I/O connector A and C Auxiliary I/O connector A and C M_DEV1 Auxiliary I/O connector B and D Auxiliary I/O signals can have one or more functionalities (for example, trigger input, timer output, or user output, depending on the signal). Their possible functionalities are described in their description in the pinout table below. Note that, unlike some other Matrox frame grabbers, there is no limit to the number of events that can be triggered simultaneously using the auxiliary input signals, nor is there a restriction on which auxiliary signal can be used to trigger the event. Only those auxiliary signals that have matching MIL information are included in this section. For information on internal connectors and a comprehensive list of all available input and output signals, refer to the board's installation and hardware reference manual. Board connectors The Matrox Radient eV-CL SF and eV-CL DF boards and cable adapter brackets provide several interface connectors. On the bracket of Matrox Radient eVCL SF, there are two Camera Link video input connectors and an auxiliary I/O connector. On the double bracket of Matrox Radient eV-CL DF, there are two pairs of Camera Link video input connectors and two auxiliary I/O connectors. On the cable adapter bracket, there are two external auxiliary I/O connectors. Only the following connectors have auxiliary signals with matching MIL information. Connector Name Connector Abbreviation Image Description Camera Link video input connectors SDR (0, 1, 2, and 3) The Camera Link video input connectors are 26-pin high-density female mini Camera Link connectors. They are used to receive video input, timing, synchronization signals and transmit/receive communication signals between the video source and the frame grabber. There are two Camera Link video input connectors (SDR 0 and 1) on Matrox Radient eV-CL SF. There are four Camera Link video input connectors (SDR 0, 1, 2 and 3) on Matrox Radient eV-CL DF. External auxiliary I/O connector HD-15 1 (A, B, C, and D) The external auxiliary I/O connectors are high-density D-subminiature 15-pin male connectors. They are used to transmit/receive auxiliary signals. External auxiliary I/O connectors A and (if present) B are located on Matrox Radient eV-CL, and external auxiliary I/O connectors C and D are located on the cable adapter bracket. 1 Previously referred to as DBHD-15, but more accurately known as DE-15.

      "text": " Matrox Radient eV-CXP connectors and signal names This section serves as a reference to match Matrox Radient eV-CXP's connectors and auxiliary signals with MIL information, such as MIL auxiliary signal numbers. To set/inquire all the settings for this board's auxiliary signals (for example, signal routing and timer settings), use MdigControl() / MdigInquire(), respectively. On Matrox Radient eV-CXP, the auxiliary signals are acquisition path independent. Any digitizer allocated on the board (M_DEV0 through M_DEV3) can access any of the auxiliary signals. Auxiliary I/O signals can have one or more functionalities (for example, trigger input, timer output, or user output, depending on the signal). Their possible functionalities are described in their description in the pinout table below. Note that, unlike some other Matrox frame grabbers, there is no limit to the number of events that can be triggered simultaneously using the auxiliary input signals, nor is there a restriction on which auxiliary signal can be used to trigger the event. Only those auxiliary signals that have matching MIL information are included in this section. For information on internal connectors and a comprehensive list of all available input and output signals, refer to the board's installation and hardware reference manual. Board connectors The Matrox Radient eV-CXP board and cable adapter brackets provide several interface connectors. On the main bracket there are four CXP connectors. On the mDP-to-HD15 adapter cable (previously referred to as MiniDP-to-DBHD-15), which connects to the main bracket, there is one external auxiliary I/O connector. On the cable adapter brackets there are four external auxiliary I/O connectors, one of which is unused. Only the following connectors have auxiliary signals with matching MIL information. Connector Name Connector Abbreviation Image Description External auxiliary I/O connector HD-15 1 (0, 1, 2 and 3) The external auxiliary I/O connectors are high-density D-subminiature 15-pin male connectors. They are used to transmit/receive auxiliary signals. External auxiliary I/O connector 0 is located on the mDP-to-HD15 adapter cable, and external auxiliary I/O connectors 1, 2 and 3 are located on the cable adapter brackets. 1 Previously referred to as DBHD-15, but more accurately known as DE-15.

If used by one digitizer, they can be simultaneously used by the other that shares this auxiliary signal. The value of n can be a number from 0 to 3, because those signals can be shared among the four different acquisition paths. Note that you must ensure that only one digitizer is driving an output signal. Matrox Radient eV-CXP connectors and signal names Board connectors Signal names and their matching MIL constants ",

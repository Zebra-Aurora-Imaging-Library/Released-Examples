  "text": " Mcode functions Synopsis The functions prefixed with Mcode make up the Code module. The Code module allows you to read, write, and grade symbols (codes) from most popular one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) symbologies (code types). The supported 1D code types include 4-state, BC412, Codeabar, Code 39, Code 93, Code 128, EAN 8, EAN 13, EAN 14, GS1-128, GS1 Databar, Industrial 2 of 5 (ITF-14), Interleaved 2 of 5 (ITF-14), Pharmacode, Planet, Postnet, UPC-A, and UPC-E. The supported 2D code types are Aztec, Data Matrix, Maxicode, QR code, Micro QR code, PDF417, MicroPDF417, and Truncated PDF417. Composite codes, which are combinations of 1D and 2D code types, are also supported. The module easily handles rotated, scaled, and degraded code occurrences, even in complex scenes. To help setup for reading or grading, the Code module can detect the type of most 1D code occurrences in an image. In addition, the module can optimize the read or grading operation settings by training them using a set of sample images.

      "text": " McodeAlloc Synopsis Allocate a code context. Syntax MIL_ID McodeAlloc( MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ContextType, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*ContextCodeIdPtr //out ) Description This function allocates a code context. A code context is a MIL object that stores one or more code models. The code model is used by the McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), McodeTrain(), and McodeWrite() operations. To add code models to the context, use McodeModel(). A code context can contain multiple code models of 1D code types (excluding GS1 databar, Planet, Postnet, and 4-state); for other code types, a code context can contain at most one code model. To identify the types of code occurrences in an image, you can perform a McodeDetect() operation; note that a code context is not required for a McodeDetect() operation. To adjust code model settings, use McodeControl(). When allocating a code context, specify whether the context should be initialized for a robust or a typical McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), or McodeTrain() operation. The initial configuration of the code context establishes the default values for some code context and code model settings. To change the initial configuration at a later date, use McodeControl() with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE. The explicit restrictions are indicated within the description of each code model setting; see McodeControl() for details. To read and grade code occurrences in an image, use McodeRead() and McodeGrade(), respectively. The module only supports searching for multiple occurrences of 1D codes (excluding 4-State, GS1 Databar, Planet, and Postnet code types) and 2D Data Matrix codes. For other types of code occurrences, the module only supports searching for a single occurrence. When reading or grading multiple code occurrences, all results can be retrieved using McodeGetResult() with M_ALL. Each occurrence has a set of results. To establish the best possible control type settings given your images, use McodeTrain(). When the code context is no longer required, release it using McodeFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during allocation; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the code context's lifetime and you must not manually free it. Parameters Parameters SysId Specifies the system on which to allocate the context. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the system Value Description M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). ContextType Specifies the context type. Reserved for future expansion. This parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. ControlFlag Specifies the initial configuration for the code context. The restrictions are indicated within each control, see McodeControl() for details. For specifying the initial configuration of the code context Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_TYPICAL_RECOGNITION. M_IMPROVED_RECOGNITION Specifies a code context that might provide a more robust McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), or McodeTrain() operation. This initialization mode is recommended if your target images lack similarity (for example, some but not all include complex or noisy backgrounds), contain distorted code occurrences, or contain code occurrences that are at an angle or even flipped. It is also recommended when searching for 2D matrix codes that are composed of dots. Note that when selecting this mode, the default of the affected code context and code model settings might change between MIL releases to improve robustness, given new features or standard recommendations. This initialization mode is not recommended with M_PHARMACODE code types. M_TYPICAL_RECOGNITION Specifies a code context that might provide a quicker McodeRead() or McodeGrade() operation, but might potentially produce less robust results. ContextCodeIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the code context identifier or specifies the data type that the function should use to return the code context identifier. For retrieving the identifier or specifying how to return it Value Description M_NULL Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated code context ; in this case, a standard MIL identifier of type MIL_ID is returned. M_UNIQUE_ID Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated code context ; in this case, a MIL smart identifier of type MIL_UNIQUE_CODE_ID is returned instead of a standard MIL identifier. This setting is only available when using C++11 (or later). A MIL smart identifier manages the lifespan of the MIL object it owns (similar to a std::unique_ptr). Note, you can use a MIL smart identifier as though it were a standard MIL identifier, except that you cannot use it to manually free the code context (it is freed automatically). For more information, see the MIL smart identifiers subsection of the MIL custom data types, void pointers, extensions, and portability functions section of Chapter 2: Building an application. Address in which to write the identifier Specifies the address of a MIL_ID in which to write the identifier of the allocated code context. If allocation fails, M_NULL is written as the identifier. Return value The returned value is the code context identifier either as a standard identifier (MIL_ID) or a smart identifier (MIL_UNIQUE_CODE_ID). If allocation fails, M_NULL is returned (or nullptr if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified). Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; milcode.lib. DLL Requires mil.dll; milcode.dll.

Syntax void McodeControl( MIL_ID&nbsp;CodeId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlType, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;ControlValue //in ) Description This function changes the setting of a specified code context, code model, or code result buffer. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler) in 64-bit mode, McodeControl() internally calls the MIL_DOUBLE version of this function (McodeControlDouble()). If you need to pass large integer values (including pointers), call the MIL_INT64 version of this function (McodeControlInt64()). Parameters Parameters CodeId Specifies the identifier of the code context, code model, or code result buffer. ControlType Specifies the setting to change. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ControlValue Specifies the setting's new value. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Parameter associations The tables below list possible values for the ControlType and ControlValue parameters. Code context settings for an McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), or McodeTrain() operation Code context settings for an McodeGrade() operation Code context settings for an McodeTrain() operation Code model settings for an McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), or McodeTrain() operation Code model settings for an McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), McodeTrain(), or McodeWrite() operation Code model settings for an McodeGrade() operation Code model settings for an McodeWrite() operation Result buffer settings dealing with an McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), McodeDetect(), McodeTrain(), or McodeWrite() operation Result buffer settings dealing with an McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), McodeTrain(), or McodeWrite() operation Result buffer settings dealing with McodeDetect() operation The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be specified for a code context, to control an McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), or McodeTrain() operation. In this case, a code context must be passed to the CodeId parameter. Note that besides code type restrictions listed explicitly in the values below, McodeGrade() does not support M_4_STATE, M_PHARMACODE, M_POSTNET, and M_PLANET code types. Although all these control types affect the results of McodeTrain(), see the description of the control types to determine if they can be activated for training; you can also use filters to limit the control types in the table to those that can be trained. Code context settings for an McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), or McodeTrain() operation ControlType Description ControlValue M_INITIALIZATION_MODE Changes the initialization mode of the context; this changes the default of several code context and code model settings. The default value of the setting in each mode is indicated within the description of the control type. When you change the initialization mode, control types that have already been set to some value (other than default) are not changed. Instead, the initialization mode only changes those control values that are set to their default value (M_DEFAULT). M_DEFAULT Same as M_TYPICAL_RECOGNITION. M_IMPROVED_RECOGNITION Specifies a code context that might provide a more robust McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), or McodeTrain() operation. This initialization mode is recommended if your target images lack similarity (for example, some but not all include complex or noisy backgrounds), contain distorted code occurrences, or contain code occurrences that are at an angle or even flipped. It is also recommended when searching for 2D matrix codes that are composed of dots. Note that when selecting this mode, the default of the affected code context and code model settings might change between MIL releases to improve robustness, given new features or standard recommendations. This initialization mode is not recommended with M_PHARMACODE code types. M_TYPICAL_RECOGNITION Specifies a code context that might provide a quicker McodeRead() or McodeGrade() operation, but might potentially produce less robust results. M_MINIMUM_CONTRAST Sets the minimum possible contrast between the foreground and background in the target image for 1D code types (excluding M_PLANET and M_POSTNET), the M_DOTCODE code type, and the M_MICROPDF417 code type when using the M_ADAPTIVE threshold mode. For 1D code types (except for M_GS1_DATABAR, M_PLANET, and M_POSTNET) and 2D cross-row code types, regardless of the threshold mode, M_MINIMUM_CONTRAST is also used to help the localization. When using the M_ADAPTIVE threshold mode for 1D code types, the M_DOTCODE code type, and the M_MICROPDF417 code type, increasing the minimum contrast will typically improve McodeRead() operations, particularly in the presence of noise and non-uniform lighting. However, if the minimum contrast is higher than the contrast of a code, the code will not be read correctly. For 2D code types (excluding M_DOTCODE and M_MICROPDF417), the minimum contrast is determined automatically, so the adaptive threshold mode does not use the M_MINIMUM_CONTRAST setting. For 1D code types (excluding M_PLANET and M_POSTNET) and 2D cross-row code types, regardless of threshold mode, you should set this control type if the contrast is less than 50 and there are difficulties decoding the code. Note that this control type can be trained using McodeTrain(); activate it for training with the combination constant M_TRAIN or with M_SET_TRAINING_STATE_ALL. Note that training this control type (M_TRAIN) is only supported for the M_DOTCODE code type. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 50. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 255 Specifies the minimum contrast. Only integer values are accepted. For the M_DOTCODE code type, this setting should be set to a value greater than or equal to 10. Only integer values are accepted. M_SCANLINE_HEIGHT Sets the height (or thickness) of the scanlines. A scanline is a line along which the code occurrence is read. When locating a code occurrence, a scanline is usually first taken across the middle of the image or the image's region of interest (ROI), if one is associated. If a code occurrence is not found, a scanline is taken either higher or lower in the image or its ROI. Usually, setting this control type to a higher value increases the robustness of McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), and McodeTrain() operations. This is especially true in noisy images. However, defects in the code can cause the need for a lower value. Using the default value is recommended. Note that during an McodeGrade() operation, after locating the code, when taking scanlines within the inspection band, MIL uses a scanline height of a single pixel regardless of the value of M_SCANLINE_HEIGHT, as per the ISO standard. This control type is only available for 1D code types (excluding M_4_STATE, M_PLANET, and M_POSTNET), 2D cross-row code types, and M_COMPOSITECODE code types. M_DEFAULT Specifies a default scanline height that is based on the code type. The table below shows the default value for some code types. Code type Default value (in pixel units) Linear bar codes (excluding M_4_STATE, M_PLANET, and M_POSTNET) 5 MicroPDF 417 1 PDF 417/Truncated PDF417 3 Composite codes 1 Value Specifies the scanline height, relative to the input coordinate system specified using M_SCANLINE_INPUT_UNITS. When entering a value in pixel units, this value must be between 1 and 256, inclusive. The value entered is rounded to the nearest integer. The recommended range of values for linear bar codes is: 1 &lt; Value &lt;= (BarcodeHeight / 2). For M_MICROPDF417 and M_COMPOSITECODE, the recommended range of values is: 1 &lt;= Value &lt;= (RowHeight / 2). When entering a value in world units, the number that results from the internal transformation of world units to pixel units must still respect the value's pixel unit constraint. To find the range of allowed values in world units, according to your associated camera calibration, use McalTransformResult(). M_SCANLINE_INPUT_UNITS Sets the units with which to interpret the M_SCANLINE_HEIGHT and M_SCANLINE_STEP control types. This essentially sets the input coordinate system to use. This control type is only available for 1D code types (excluding M_4_STATE, M_PLANET, and M_POSTNET), 2D cross-row code types, and M_COMPOSITECODE code types. M_DEFAULT Same as M_PIXEL. M_PIXEL Specifies to interpret the values in pixel units, with respect to the pixel coordinate system. M_WORLD Specifies to interpret the values in world units, with respect to the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, calling McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), or McodeTrain() generates an error if the operation is not performed on a calibrated image. M_SCANLINE_STEP Sets the scanline step. The scanline step is the distance, or gap, between scanlines taken in the image or the image's region of interest (ROI), if one is associated. In general, the higher the value for this control type, the faster the code is read, but the greater the chance of missing a readable line of code. Using the default value is recommended; the default value is dependent upon the search speed. Note that during an McodeGrade() operation, after locating the code, when taking scanlines within the inspection band, MIL uses a scanline step distance based on the height of the inspection band and the required number of scanlines, regardless of the value of M_SCANLINE_STEP, as per the ISO standard; the ISO standard requires ten evenly spaced scanlines within the inspection band. This control type is only available for 1D code types (excluding M_4_STATE, M_PLANET, and M_POSTNET), 2D cross-row code types, and M_COMPOSITECODE code types. M_DEFAULT Specifies a default scanline step that is based on the value of M_SPEED. When dealing with 1D code types (excluding M_4_STATE, M_PLANET, and M_POSTNET) and M_COMPOSITECODE code types, the following values are associated with M_DEFAULT. M_SPEED value Default value M_LOW 5 M_VERY_LOW 5 M_MEDIUM 10 M_HIGH 15 M_VERY_HIGH 25 When dealing with 2D cross-row code types, the default value is 2, regardless of the value of M_SPEED. Value Specifies the scanline step, relative to the input coordinate system specified using M_SCANLINE_INPUT_UNITS. When entering a value in pixel units, this value must be greater than or equal to 1. The value entered is rounded to the nearest integer. When entering a value in world units, the number that results from the internal transformation of world units to pixel units must still respect the value's pixel unit constraint. To find the range of allowed values in world units, according to your associated camera calibration, use McalTransformResult(). M_SEARCH_ANGLE_MODE Sets whether to enable the search angular range algorithm for the code context. When enabled, codes are sought at the angular range defined by M_SEARCH_ANGLE - M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_NEG to M_SEARCH_ANGLE + M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_POS. For 1D codes, the Code module will not use the search angular range algorithm if M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_NEG and M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_POS both have a value of less than 5°, regardless of M_SEARCH_ANGLE_MODE. For linear code types, if you expect that the codes sought are close to their nominal angle, you can try disabling the search angular range algorithm to see if the Code module can still find the required code occurrences. Disabling this algorithm might speed up the search depending on the code type and the target image. For the M_AZTEC, M_DATAMATRIX, M_DOTCODE, M_QRCODE, M_MICROQRCODE, M_MAXICODE, M_PDF417, and M_TRUNCATED_PDF417 code types, the angular range does not affect the speed of the operation. For M_PDF417 and M_TRUNCATED_PDF417, you can set M_DECODE_ALGORITHM to M_SCANLINE_AT_ANGLE if you are having issues reading your code at an angle. Note that although this improves robustness, this might affect the speed of the operation. You can try disabling M_SEARCH_ANGLE_MODE to see if the Code module can still find the required code occurrences; this might improve the speed. Note that M_SEARCH_ANGLE_MODE is automatically activated for training if you activate M_SEARCH_ANGLE for training. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ENABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that the search angular range algorithm is not used. M_ENABLE Specifies that the search angular range algorithm is used. M_SPEED Sets the search speed. The faster the search speed, the less robust the operation. For 1D code types, consider reducing the search speed when the pixel height of the bar code is small. For 2D code types, consider reducing the search speed when the cell size is small relative to the image size. This control type is available for all code types except M_DOTCODE. For 1D code types, M_COMPOSITECODE, and M_MICROPDF417, you can also affect the search speed by adjusting the value for M_SCANLINE_STEP. Note that this control type can be trained using McodeTrain(); activate it for training with the combination constant M_TRAIN or with M_SET_TRAINING_STATE_ALL. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value, which is dependent on the initialization mode. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_IMPROVED_RECOGNITION, the default value is M_VERY_LOW. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_TYPICAL_RECOGNITION, the default value is M_MEDIUM. M_HIGH Specifies a high search speed. M_LOW Specifies a low search speed. M_MEDIUM Specifies a medium search speed. M_VERY_HIGH Specifies a very high search speed. M_VERY_LOW Specifies a very low search speed. M_STOP_READ Stops the current McodeRead() or McodeGrade() operation being performed on the code context passed to CodeId. You must call McodeControl() with M_STOP_READ from another thread, typically of higher priority. After making this call, the results returned to the result buffer of the McodeRead() or McodeGrade() operation are invalid and discarded. M_DEFAULT Implements the default behavior. M_THRESHOLD_MODE Sets the threshold mode used to internally binarize the source image. If the lighting is non-uniform across the code, use M_ADAPTIVE mode or process the image before performing the McodeRead() or McodeGrade() operation so that the background is strictly darker or strictly lighter than the code. Note that this control type can be trained using McodeTrain(); activate it for training with the combination constant M_TRAIN or with M_SET_TRAINING_STATE_ALL. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value, which is dependent on the code type and the initialization mode. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_IMPROVED_RECOGNITION, the default value for M_MICROPDF417 and linear (1D) code types (except M_PHARMACODE) is M_GLOBAL_SEGMENTATION, and the default value for the remaining code types is M_ADAPTIVE. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_TYPICAL_RECOGNITION, the default value for M_DOTCODE is M_ADAPTIVE, and the default value for the remaining code types is M_GLOBAL_SEGMENTATION. M_ADAPTIVE Specifies to use a fast dynamic local threshold. This mode selects an individual threshold for each pixel based on the range of intensity values in its local neighborhood. For linear (1D) code types (excluding M_PLANET and M_POSTNET), the M_DOTCODE code type, and the M_MICROPDF417 code type, you must specify the minimum contrast (McodeControl() with M_MINIMUM_CONTRAST) between the foreground and background in the target image when using the M_ADAPTIVE mode. It is highly recommended that M_CELL_SIZE_MIN is set to a valid value that is not M_DEFAULT; if your code is not decoded properly, increase the value of M_CELL_SIZE_MIN. For 2D code types (excluding M_DOTCODE and M_MICROPDF417), the minimum contrast is determined automatically, so the adaptive threshold mode does not use the M_MINIMUM_CONTRAST setting. 2D and 1D code types (excluding M_PLANET and M_POSTNET) are the code types that support M_ADAPTIVE. M_GLOBAL_SEGMENTATION Specifies to use a global threshold value. Specify the value using M_THRESHOLD_VALUE. M_GLOBAL_WITH_LOCAL_RESEGMENTATION Specifies that the source image will be globally thresholded and then the edges in the binarized image are resegmented according to the intensities of the surrounding bars and spaces in the original source image. These individual local thresholds, calculated per region, help enhance the edge positions in the code. Specify the global threshold value using M_THRESHOLD_VALUE. This binarization method is compatible with the methods described in the various ISO code grading standards. For more information, refer to the Technical code information subsection of the Basic concepts for the MIL Code module section of Chapter 17: Codes. This control value is available for all 1D code types (except M_4_STATE, M_POSTNET, and M_PLANET) and the M_MICROPDF417 code type. M_THRESHOLD_VALUE Sets the threshold value used to internally binarize the source image, depending on the specified threshold mode. Note that if M_THRESHOLD_MODE is set to M_ADAPTIVE, this control type is ignored. Note that this control type is automatically activated for training if you activate M_THRESHOLD_MODE for training. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO_COMPUTE. M_AUTO_COMPUTE Specifies the threshold value automatically. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 255 Specifies the threshold value. Only integer values are accepted. M_TIMEOUT Specifies the maximum decoding time for an McodeRead() or McodeGrade() operation, in msec. Note that this control type can still affect McodeTrain(). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 2000 msec. M_DISABLE Specifies that there is no maximum decoding time. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the maximum decoding time, in msec. M_TOTAL_NUMBER Sets the maximum number of code occurrences to read or grade in one source image. Note that this number is limited by the maximum number of occurrences of each code model to read or grade (M_NUMBER). To avoid obtaining false positives when searching for a specific number of occurrences, set M_CODE_SEARCH_MODE to M_BEST. Note that M_BEST is not supported for 2D code types other than the M_DOTCODE code type. The following table lists the code types that support searching for multiple occurrences: Code type Multiple occurrences Linear bar codes (excluding M_GS1_DATABAR, M_4_STATE, M_PLANET, and M_POSTNET) Yes M_DATAMATRIX Yes M_DOTCODE Yes Only the code types in the table above support this control type. When dealing with all other code types, M_TOTAL_NUMBER must be set to M_DEFAULT. Note that for M_DATAMATRIX and M_DOTCODE code types, M_TOTAL_NUMBER should be set to the same value as M_NUMBER or to M_DEFAULT because a code context can only contain multiple code models of the above-mentioned 1D code types. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ALL. M_ALL Specifies to read/grade all code occurrences in the source image, up to the maximum number of occurrences to read/grade of each code model (M_NUMBER). Value &gt; 0 Specifies the maximum number of codes to read/grade in one source image. Only integer values are accepted. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be specified for a code context, to control an McodeGrade() operation. In this case, a code context must be passed to the CodeId parameter. Note that besides code type restrictions listed explicitly in the values below, McodeGrade() does not support M_4_STATE, M_PHARMACODE, M_POSTNET, and M_PLANET code types. Code context settings for an McodeGrade() operation ControlType Description ControlValue M_ABSOLUTE_APERTURE_SIZE Sets the absolute size (diameter) of the aperture. Use this control type when using an absolute aperture mode (using M_APERTURE_MODE set to M_ABSOLUTE). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the absolute aperture size, relative to the input coordinate system specified using M_ABSOLUTE_APERTURE_SIZE_INPUT_UNITS. M_ABSOLUTE_APERTURE_SIZE_INPUT_UNITS Sets the units with which to interpret the M_ABSOLUTE_APERTURE_SIZE control type. This essentially sets the input coordinate system to use. M_DEFAULT Same as M_PIXEL. M_PIXEL Specifies to interpret the value in pixel units, with respect to the pixel coordinate system. M_WORLD Specifies to interpret the value in world units, with respect to the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, calling McodeGrade() generates an error if the operation is not performed on a calibrated image. M_APERTURE_MODE Sets the way in which the aperture size is determined. M_DEFAULT Same as M_RELATIVE. M_ABSOLUTE Specifies to use the absolute aperture size, set using M_ABSOLUTE_APERTURE_SIZE. M_DISABLE Specifies to disable the aperture. Note that this is provided for backwards compatibility with older code. In this case, the McodeGrade() operation's returned results will more closely resemble the results of an McodeRead() operation. M_RELATIVE Specifies to use a relative aperture size, based on the cell size (using M_CELL_SIZE...) and the relative aperture factor (using M_RELATIVE_APERTURE_FACTOR). M_DPM_CALIBRATION_RESULTS Sets the expected reflectance and mean light values derived during the reflectance calibration phase. This control type is an alternative to separately obtaining the reflectance and mean light values from the result buffer used during the reflectance calibration phase, and setting M_REFLECTANCE_CALIBRATION and M_MEAN_LIGHT_CALIBRATION to these two values, respectively, in the code context associated with the target code. This control type is available for M_AZTEC, M_DATAMATRIX, M_QRCODE, and M_MICROQRCODE code types. Result buffer identifier Specifies the result buffer used during the reflectance calibration phase. M_EXTENDED_AREA_REFLECTANCE_CHECK Sets whether the grading must perform an additional reflectance check over an area containing the code occurrence and its extended area (that is, 20 times the cell size beyond the quiet zone on all sides). This control type is only available for M_AZTEC, M_DATAMATRIX, M_DOTCODE, M_QRCODE, and M_MICROQRCODE code types. Note that this control type must be set before an McodeRead() operation if you intend to use the result for an McodeGrade() operation. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to disable the additional reflectance check. M_ENABLE Specifies to enable the additional reflectance check. Note that you can only enable this control type when performing an ISO grading (that is, when M_GRADING_STANDARD is set to M_ISO_GRADING). M_GRADE_QUIET_ZONE Sets whether to include the quiet zone when performing an McodeGrade() operation. This control type is available for M_DATAMATRIX, M_DOTCODE, M_QRCODE, and M_MICROQRCODE code types. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ENABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to exclude the quiet zone. M_ENABLE Specifies to include the quiet zone. M_GRADING_STANDARD Sets the grading standard to use when performing an McodeGrade() operation. To specify a particular grading standard edition, use M_GRADING_STANDARD_EDITION. The results of the McodeGrade() operation are dependent on the standard used; some control types have a different implementation or meaning depending on the standard used. These differences are outlined in the control types' description. Note that this control type must be set before an McodeRead() operation if you intend to use the result for an McodeGrade() operation. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ISO_GRADING. M_ISO_DPM_GRADING Specifies to use an ISO/IEC 29158 specification. Note that this is the replacement for the AIM DPM-1-2006 standard. This control value must be used at the beginning of the target grading phase, and should not be used during the reflectance calibration phase. This control value is available for M_AZTEC, M_DATAMATRIX, M_QRCODE, and M_MICROQRCODE code types. M_ISO_GRADING Specifies to use an ISO/IEC 15416 or ISO/IEC 15415 specification. M_SEMI_T10_GRADING Specifies to use a Semi T10 specification. This control value is available for the M_DATAMATRIX code type. This control type requires that M_APERTURE_MODE, M_MAXIMUM_CALIBRATED_REFLECTANCE, and M_MINIMUM_CALIBRATED_REFLECTANCE are set to M_DEFAULT. M_INSPECTION_BAND_RATIO Sets the height of the inspection band as a percentage of the average bar height. The inspection band is the area of the code occurrence from which the scanlines to grade the code occurrence are taken, after it has been located. This control type is only available for 1D code types, 2D cross-row code types, and M_COMPOSITECODE code types. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default percentage. The default value is 80% of average bar height. 0.0 &lt; Value &lt; 100.0 Specifies the percentage of the average bar height to set as the height of the inspection band. M_LIGHTING_CONFIGURATION Sets the tilted coaxial lighting and camera angle position (TCL) relative to the marked object. There is a tolerance of +/- 3 degrees between the angle of the light and the angle of the camera. See the ISO/IEC 29518:2020 specifications for further details. This control type is only available for M_AZTEC, M_DATAMATRIX, M_QRCODE, and M_MICROQRCODE code types. M_DEFAULT Same as M_UNSPECIFIED. M_90_DEGREE Specifies the TCL is 90 degrees relative to the marked object. If M_GRADING_STANDARD_EDITION is set to M_ISO_29158_2020, this will cause M_MINIMUM_REFLECTANCE and M_MINIMUM_REFLECTANCE_GRADE to return M_CODE_GRADE_NOT_AVAILABLE. If M_GRADING_STANDARD_EDITION is set to M_ISO_29158_2011, this setting will have no effect. M_UNSPECIFIED Specifies that the TCL is none of the other values. M_MAXIMUM_CALIBRATED_REFLECTANCE Sets the maximum possible grayscale value in the target image. This control type is used in the scan reflectance profile analysis. If this control type does not accurately represent the actual maximum grayscale value from the target image, the resulting values from the scan reflectance profile are invalid. Note that this value must be higher than the value of M_MINIMUM_CALIBRATED_REFLECTANCE. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 255. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 255 Specifies the maximum calibrated reflectance. Only integer values are accepted. M_MEAN_LIGHT_CALIBRATION Sets the expected mean light (MLcal). This corresponds to the expected mean intensity of the centers of the white elements of the code occurrence. This control type is used during the target grading phase of the ISO/IEC 29158 specification. Note that the value of this control type can also be set using M_DPM_CALIBRATION_RESULTS. This control type is available for M_AZTEC, M_DATAMATRIX, M_QRCODE, and M_MICROQRCODE code types. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is equal to the setting of M_MAXIMUM_CALIBRATED_REFLECTANCE. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 255 Specifies the mean intensity. This value is typically derived during the reflectance calibration phase. M_MINIMUM_CALIBRATED_REFLECTANCE Sets the minimum possible grayscale value in the target image. This control type is used in the scan reflectance profile analysis. If this control type does not accurately represent the actual minimum grayscale value from the target image, the resulting values from the scan reflectance profile are invalid. Note that this value must be lower than the value of M_MAXIMUM_CALIBRATED_REFLECTANCE. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 255 Specifies the minimum calibrated reflectance. Only integer values are accepted. M_NUMBER_OF_SCANLINES Sets the number of scanlines inside the inspection band to inspect during the McodeGrade() operation, after the code occurrence has been located. Set the height of the inspection band using M_INSPECTION_BAND_RATIO. This control type is only available for 1D code types, 2D cross-row code types, and M_COMPOSITECODE code types. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value. The default value is 10 scanlines. M_ALL Specifies to use all possible scanlines inside the inspection band. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the number of scanlines to inspect. This value is equivalent to M_ALL if it exceeds the inspection band height. Only integer values are accepted. M_PIXEL_SIZE_IN_MM Sets the scale between a pixel and its physical measurement in mm. To simplify the computation of this value, measure the length of the entire code and divide it by its pixel length; this yields a good approximation. Alternatively, calculate the scale using the following formula: (size of the object) / (number of pixels in object). For more information, see point 3 in the Relative aperture setting subsection of the Settings for a code grade operation section of Chapter 18: More on grading codes. Code specifications generally specify constraints in mm units. To compare values known in MIL (for example, the cell size in pixels) to the values in the code specifications, this control type is used. Note that this control type can impact other control types, for example, the aperture size selection, and the M_SCAN_INTERCHARACTER_GAP_GRADE result (retrieved using McodeGetResult()). Note that this value is needed even when operating on calibrated images because MIL does not know the relationship between mm and the world units of the calibrated context. M_DEFAULT Same as M_UNKNOWN. M_UNKNOWN Specifies that the scale between a pixel and its physical measurement is not known, in mm per pixel units. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the scale between a pixel and its physical measurement, in mm per pixel units. M_REFLECTANCE_CALIBRATION Sets the expected reflectance value (Rcal). This control type is used during the target grading phase of the ISO/IEC 29158 specification. Note that the value of this control type can also be set using M_DPM_CALIBRATION_RESULTS. This control type is available for M_AZTEC, M_DATAMATRIX, M_QRCODE, and M_MICROQRCODE code types. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is equal to the setting of M_MAXIMUM_CALIBRATED_REFLECTANCE. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 255 Specifies the reflectance value. This value is typically derived during the reflectance calibration phase. Only integer values are accepted. M_RELATIVE_APERTURE_FACTOR Sets the aperture factor to use when M_APERTURE_MODE is set to M_RELATIVE. The aperture factor is multiplied by the M_CELL_SIZE_MIN to determine the aperture's diameter. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_AUTO Specifies that the aperture factor is chosen according to the ISO/IEC 15416 specification for all supported code types except 2D matrix code types; for the latter, the aperture factor is chosen according to the ISO/IEC 15415 or ISO/IEC 29158 specification (depends on M_GRADING_STANDARD). Note that if the nominal bar width is less than 0.1 mm, the aperture factor is 0.5. When dealing with EAN/UPC code types, the aperture factor is 0.15. When dealing with 2D matrix code types, the aperture factor is 0.8. Note that the recommended aperture size in the ISO/IEC 15415 specification has changed. The 2004 specification states that the aperture size should be 0.8 times the diameter. The 2011 specification recommends an aperture size between 50% and 80% of the smallest X-dimension encountered. M_AUTO complies with the 2004 version of the specification. Since the new specification now permits alternative aperture sizes, using an aperture factor of 0.5 with 2D matrix code types can often lead to better results. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 2 Specifies the aperture factor. M_SYSTEM_RESPONSE_CALIBRATION Sets the System Response value derived during the reflectance calibration phase (SRcal) of the ISO/IEC 29158 specification. The System Response value is a user-defined aggregate of the settings of environmental factors, such as exposure time and/or gain factor, that create the conditions for an acceptable image of the code. For example, you could define the System Response value as: ( Exposure time * Gain factor ). During the reflectance calibration phase, adjust the exposure time and/or gain factor until you obtain an acceptable image of the code, and then multiply the two values together. At the beginning of the target grading phase, set this result as the System Response value of the reflectance calibration phase. Note that you should use the same formula to calculate the System Response value, in both the reflectance calibration phase and the target grading phase. This control type is only available for M_AZTEC, M_DATAMATRIX, M_QRCODE, and M_MICROQRCODE code types. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the System Response value for the reference code. M_SYSTEM_RESPONSE_TARGET Sets the System Response value derived during the target grading phase (SRtarget) of the ISO/IEC 29158 specification. To set this control type, use the same aggregate of environmental factors that was used to calculate M_SYSTEM_RESPONSE_CALIBRATION. For example, if you set the System Response value of the reflectance calibration phase to the multiplication of the exposure time by the gain factor, set the System Response value of the target grading phase to the multiplication of the exposure time by the gain factor used to create the conditions for an acceptable image of the target code. During the target grading phase, you should not alter any environmental factors other than those used to calculate the System Response value. This control type is only available for M_AZTEC, M_DATAMATRIX, M_QRCODE, and M_MICROQRCODE code types. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the System Response value for the target code. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be specified when dealing with an McodeTrain() operation. In this case, a code context must be passed to the CodeId parameter. Code context settings for an McodeTrain() operation ControlType Description ControlValue M_RESET_FROM_TRAINED_RESULTS Resets the code context using the results in the code train result buffer. Existing code models are discarded and code models used for training are added to the context. If a control type was not trained, it is set to its value used during training; if a control type was trained, it is set to its trained value. The results in the code train result buffer can be applied to any code context. To reconfigure the code context that was used during training, you might find it useful to selectively change some control types to their recommended setting, established during training. To do so, you can use McodeGetResult() to retrieve their recommended setting, and then use McodeControl() to set them explicitly. Note that some control types are inter-dependent. Changing the setting of one control type to its trained value might not be optimal if the settings of other control types are not also changed. This is especially true for control types that are automatically activated for training if another control type is activated (for example, M_CELL_NUMBER_...). CodeTrainResultBufId Specifies the identifier of the code train result buffer to use to reset the code context. The result buffer must have been previously allocated using McodeAllocResult() with M_CODE_TRAIN_RESULT and must contain results from a successful McodeTrain(). Use McodeGetResult() with M_STATUS to ensure that the result buffer contains results from a successful operation (M_STATUS_TRAIN_OK). M_SET_TRAINING_STATE_ALL Resets whether all trainable control types will be trained when McodeTrain() is called. Using this control type is equivalent to using the M_TRAIN combination value with every trainable control type. After activating or deactivating all trainable control types using M_SET_TRAINING_STATE_ALL, you can then activate or deactivate the training of specific control types using M_TRAIN, if necessary. M_SET_TRAINING_STATE_ALL modifies the training status of M_CELL_NUMBER_X, M_CELL_NUMBER_Y, M_CELL_SIZE_MAX, M_CELL_SIZE_MIN, M_CODE_FLIP, M_DATAMATRIX_SHAPE, M_DECODE_ALGORITHM, M_DOT_SPACING_MAX, M_DOT_SPACING_MIN, M_ENCODING, M_ERROR_CORRECTION, M_FOREGROUND_VALUE, M_SEARCH_ANGLE, M_SPEED, M_THRESHOLD_MODE, and M_USE_PRESEARCH. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default activation; the default activation depends on the control type and code model type. For a given trainable control type, if an unsupported code model is included in the training, the default value will be M_DISABLE, otherwise it will be M_ENABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to not train any of the trainable control types. M_ENABLE Specifies to train all trainable control types. M_STOP_TRAIN Stops the current McodeTrain() operation being performed on the code context passed to CodeId. This must be called from another thread, typically of higher priority. After making this call, the results returned to the result buffer of the McodeTrain() operation are invalid and discarded. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default behavior. M_TRAIN_TIMEOUT Sets the maximum training time for an McodeTrain() operation. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to disable the timeout. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the timeout limit, in msec. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be specified for a code model to control an McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), or McodeTrain() operation. If you pass a code context to the CodeId parameter, the specified control type setting is applied to all the code models in the context. If none of the code models support the specified control type, an error will occur. If only some code models do not support the specified control type, the control type setting is ignored for these code models. Note that besides code type restrictions listed explicitly in the values below, McodeGrade() does not support M_4_STATE, M_PHARMACODE, M_POSTNET, and M_PLANET code types. Although all these control types affect the results of McodeTrain(), see the description of the control types to determine if they can be activated for training; you can also use filters to limit the control types in the table to those that can be trained. Code model settings for an McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), or McodeTrain() operation ControlType Description ControlValue M_BEARER_BAR Sets whether bearer bars run along the top and bottom of the code occurrences to read (such as, the edge of a sticker). Note that this control type is only taken into account when the search angle is not specified. This value is available only for 1D code types. In situations where bearer bars don't run along both the top and the bottom of the code occurrence to read, setting M_SPEED to M_VERY_LOW will provide more robust results. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ABSENT. M_ABSENT Specifies that no bearer bars are above and below the code. M_PRESENT Specifies that there are bearer bars above and below the code. M_CELL_NUMBER_X_MAX Sets the maximum number of cells for which to search, in the X-direction of a 2D code. Note that McodeControl() generates an error if you set both a range of cells for which to search (using M_CELL_NUMBER_X_MAX, M_CELL_NUMBER_X_MIN, M_CELL_NUMBER_Y_MAX, and/or M_CELL_NUMBER_Y_MIN) and an explicit number of cells for which to search (using M_CELL_NUMBER_X and/or M_CELL_NUMBER_Y). This control type is only available for 2D code types. Note that this control type is automatically activated for training if you activate M_CELL_NUMBER_X for training. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ANY. M_ANY Specifies to search for code occurrences with any number of cells. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the maximum number of cells for which to search. If a value is specified, it must be larger than M_CELL_NUMBER_X_MIN, otherwise an error occurs. For the M_DOTCODE code type, this setting should be set to a value greater than 4. Only integer values are accepted. M_CELL_NUMBER_X_MIN Sets the minimum number of cells for which to search, in the X-direction of a 2D code. Note that McodeControl() generates an error if you set both a range of cells for which to search (using M_CELL_NUMBER_X_MAX, M_CELL_NUMBER_X_MIN, M_CELL_NUMBER_Y_MAX, and/or M_CELL_NUMBER_Y_MIN) and an explicit number of cells for which to search (using M_CELL_NUMBER_X and/or M_CELL_NUMBER_Y). This control type is only available for 2D code types. Note that this control type is automatically activated for training if you activate M_CELL_NUMBER_X for training. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ANY. M_ANY Specifies to search for code occurrences with any number of cells. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the minimum number of cells for which to search. If a value is specified, it must be smaller than M_CELL_NUMBER_X_MAX, otherwise an error occurs. For the M_DOTCODE code type, this setting should be set to a value greater than 4. Only integer values are accepted. M_CELL_NUMBER_Y_MAX Sets the maximum number of cells for which to search, in the Y-direction of a 2D code. Note that McodeControl() generates an error if you set both a range of cells for which to search (using M_CELL_NUMBER_X_MAX, M_CELL_NUMBER_X_MIN, M_CELL_NUMBER_Y_MAX, and/or M_CELL_NUMBER_Y_MIN) and an explicit number of cells for which to search (using M_CELL_NUMBER_X and/or M_CELL_NUMBER_Y). This control type is only available for 2D code types. Note that this control type is automatically activated for training if you activate M_CELL_NUMBER_Y for training. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ANY. M_ANY Specifies to search for code occurrences with any number of cells. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the maximum number of cells for which to search. If a value is specified, it must be larger than M_CELL_NUMBER_Y_MIN, otherwise an error occurs. For the M_DOTCODE code type, this setting should be set to a value greater than 4. Only integer values are accepted. M_CELL_NUMBER_Y_MIN Sets the minimum number of cells for which to search, in the Y-direction of a 2D code. Note that McodeControl() generates an error if you set both a range of cells for which to search (using M_CELL_NUMBER_X_MAX, M_CELL_NUMBER_X_MIN, M_CELL_NUMBER_Y_MAX, and/or M_CELL_NUMBER_Y_MIN) and an explicit number of cells for which to search (using M_CELL_NUMBER_X and/or M_CELL_NUMBER_Y). This control type is only available for 2D code types. Note that this control type is automatically activated for training if you activate M_CELL_NUMBER_Y for training. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ANY. M_ANY Specifies to search for code occurrences with any number of cells. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the minimum number of cells for which to search. If a value is specified, it must be smaller than M_CELL_NUMBER_Y_MAX, otherwise an error occurs. For the M_DOTCODE code type, this setting should be set to a value greater than 4. Only integer values are accepted. M_CELL_SIZE_MAX Sets the maximum cell size. Note that setting the maximum and minimum cell size increases both the speed and robustness of the operation. Note that this control type can be trained using McodeTrain(); activate it for training with the combination constant M_TRAIN or with M_SET_TRAINING_STATE_ALL. M_DEFAULT Specifies to automatically select an appropriate size, which is dependent on the code type and the initialization mode. For a M_DOTCODE code type, the default is always 255 when M_INITIALIZATION_MODE is set to M_IMPROVED_RECOGNITION. For all code types, the default is always 24 when M_INITIALIZATION_MODE is set to M_TYPICAL_RECOGNITION. Value Specifies the maximum cell size, relative to the input coordinate system specified using M_CELL_SIZE_INPUT_UNITS. When entering a value in pixel units, this value must be between 1 and 256, inclusive. When entering a value in world units, the number that results from the internal transformation of world units to pixel units must still respect the value's pixel unit constraint. To find the range of allowed values in world units, according to your associated camera calibration, use McalTransformResult(). M_CELL_SIZE_MIN Sets the minimum cell size. Note that setting the maximum and minimum cell size increases both the speed and robustness of the operation. Note that this control type can be trained using McodeTrain(); activate it for training with the combination constant M_TRAIN or with M_SET_TRAINING_STATE_ALL. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default cell size, in pixels, which is dependent on the operation and code type. Setting the default ignores the input unit type chosen with M_CELL_SIZE_INPUT_UNITS. For an McodeRead() operation, M_DEFAULT is equivalent to 1, except for M_AZTEC, M_DATAMATRIX, M_QRCODE, and M_MICROQRCODE (which have a default of 3). For a M_DOTCODE code type regardless of the operation, the default is always 2. Value Specifies the minimum cell size, relative to the input coordinate system specified using M_CELL_SIZE_INPUT_UNITS. When entering a value in pixel units, this value must be between 1 and 256, inclusive. When entering a value in world units, the number that results from the internal transformation of world units to pixel units must still respect the value's pixel unit constraint. To find the range of allowed values in world units, according to your associated camera calibration, use McalTransformResult(). M_CHECK_FINDER_PATTERN Sets whether checking for a false Data Matrix pattern is enabled. If this control type is enabled, McodeRead() and McodeGrade() operations are more robust, and false Data Matrix code types are not read. This control type should only be enabled if it is possible that parts of your image could be falsely interpreted as a Data Matrix code types. This control type is only available for the M_DATAMATRIX code type. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that the Code module will not check for false M_DATAMATRIX code types. M_ENABLE Specifies that the Code module will check for false M_DATAMATRIX code types. M_CHECK_QUIET_ZONE Sets whether the presence of the quiet zone is necessary for a successful McodeRead() or McodeGrade() operation of this code type. Note that the specifications of a code's quiet zone are dependent upon the code type. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value, which is dependent on the code type. The default value for M_DOTCODE is M_DISABLE. For all other code types, the default is M_ENABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that a quiet zone is not necessary. When set to M_DISABLE, the McodeRead() or McodeGrade() operation can be less robust, especially for 1D code types. M_ENABLE Specifies that a quiet zone is necessary. M_CODE_FLIP Sets whether code occurrences need to be flipped or read in the opposite direction to be read properly. Note that this control type can be trained using McodeTrain(); activate it for training with the combination constant M_TRAIN or with M_SET_TRAINING_STATE_ALL. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value, which is dependent on the initialization mode. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_IMPROVED_RECOGNITION, the default value is M_ANY. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_TYPICAL_RECOGNITION, the default value is M_NO_FLIP. M_ANY Allows MIL to decide whether a code occurrence needs to be flipped or read in the opposite direction to be read properly. M_FLIP Specifies that code occurrences need to be flipped or read in the opposite direction to be read properly. When dealing with 1D code types, a code occurrence will be read from left-to-right and from right-to-left. When dealing with 2D code types, a code occurrence will be flipped before being read. M_NO_FLIP Specifies that code occurrences don't need to be flipped or read in the opposite direction. When dealing with 1D code types, a code occurrence will be read from left-to-right. When dealing with 2D code types, a code occurrence will not be flipped. M_CODE_SEARCH_MODE Sets the behavior of the decoding algorithm. Note that the default setting is M_FAST in the majority of cases. To avoid obtaining false positives when searching for a specific number of occurrences (M_NUMBER and M_TOTAL_NUMBER), set M_CODE_SEARCH_MODE to M_BEST. This control type is available for 1D code types (excluding M_4_STATE, M_PLANET, and M_POSTNET), the M_DOTCODE code type, and M_COMPOSITECODE code types. Note that this control type can be trained using McodeTrain(); activate it for training with the combination constant M_TRAIN or with M_SET_TRAINING_STATE_ALL. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value, which is dependent on the code type. The default value is M_FAST for all code types except M_PHARMACODE, in which case, the default value is M_BEST. M_BEST Specifies to search and return the best quality code occurrences. M_FAST Specifies to search and return the first code occurrences decoded. M_DATAMATRIX_SHAPE Sets the shape of the Data Matrix code type. This control type is only available for the M_DATAMATRIX code type. Note that this control type can be trained using McodeTrain(); activate it for training with the combination constant M_TRAIN or with M_SET_TRAINING_STATE_ALL. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ANY. M_ANY Specifies that the M_DATAMATRIX code type can be any shape. M_RECTANGLE Specifies that the M_DATAMATRIX code has a rectangular shape. This shape can only use the M_ECC_200 error correction scheme. M_SQUARE Specifies that the M_DATAMATRIX code has a square shape. The number of cells in X and Y must be equal, and the aspect ratio of cell sizes in the X and Y direction must be near 1:1. M_DECODE_ALGORITHM Sets the decoding algorithm to use to read the code occurrences. This control type is available for M_AZTEC, M_DATAMATRIX, M_DOTCODE, M_QRCODE, M_PDF417, and M_TRUNCATED_PDF417 code types. Note that this control type can be trained using McodeTrain(); activate it for training with the combination constant M_TRAIN or with M_SET_TRAINING_STATE_ALL. Note that training this control type (M_TRAIN) is not supported for the M_DOTCODE code type. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value, which is dependent on the code type and the initialization mode. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_IMPROVED_RECOGNITION, the default value for M_PDF417 and M_TRUNCATED_PDF417 is M_CODE_NOT_DEFORMED, and the default value for the remaining code types is M_CODE_DEFORMED. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_TYPICAL_RECOGNITION, the default value is M_CODE_NOT_DEFORMED for all code types except M_DOTCODE, in which case, the default value is M_CODE_DEFORMED. M_CODE_DEFORMED Specifies to use the algorithm to decode deformed code occurrences. This algorithm is only available for M_AZTEC, M_DATAMATRIX, M_QRCODE, and M_DOTCODE code types. Note that selecting this algorithm might lead to longer processing times. M_CODE_NOT_DEFORMED Specifies to use the algorithm to decode non-deformed code occurrences. M_SCANLINE_AT_ANGLE Specifies to use the algorithm to decode M_PDF417 or M_TRUNCATED_PDF417 code occurrences using rotated scanlines, without any localization. The angle of the scanlines is determined using M_SEARCH_ANGLE. Select this algorithm if you have codes that do not completely respect their specification (for example, they are missing their quiet zone). To get the best performance, specify a precise M_SEARCH_ANGLE or use M_SEARCH_ANGLE_STEP; also, ensure M_SCANLINE_HEIGHT is not set to a value higher than the row height. This algorithm is only available for M_PDF417 and M_TRUNCATED_PDF417 code types. M_DOT_SIZE_INPUT_UNITS Sets the units with which to interpret the M_DOT_SIZE_MIN and M_DOT_SIZE_MAX control types. This essentially sets the input coordinate system to use. This control type is only available for the M_DOTCODE code type. M_DEFAULT Same as M_PIXEL. M_PIXEL Specifies to interpret the values in pixel units, with respect to the pixel coordinate system. M_WORLD Specifies to interpret the values in world units, with respect to the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, calling McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), McodeTrain(), or McodeWrite() generates an error if the operation is not performed on a calibrated image. M_DOT_SIZE_MAX Sets the maximum diameter of the dots for which to search. This control type is only available for the M_DOTCODE code type. Note that setting the maximum and minimum dot size increases both the speed and robustness of the operation. Note that this control type can be trained using McodeTrain(); activate it for training with the combination constant M_TRAIN or with M_SET_TRAINING_STATE_ALL. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value, which is dependent on the initialization mode. The default is always 255 when M_INITIALIZATION_MODE is set to M_IMPROVED_RECOGNITION. Whereas the default is always 24 when M_INITIALIZATION_MODE is set to M_TYPICAL_RECOGNITION. M_AUTO Specifies to select an appropriate size, automatically. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the maximum dot size, relative to the input coordinate system specified using M_DOT_SIZE_INPUT_UNITS. When entering a value in world units, the number that results from the internal transformation of world units to pixel units must still respect the value's pixel unit constraint. To find the range of allowed values in world units, according to your associated camera calibration, use McalTransformResult(). M_DOT_SIZE_MIN Sets the minimum diameter of the dots for which to search. This control type is only available for the M_DOTCODE code type. Note that setting the maximum and minimum dot size increases both the speed and robustness of the operation. Note that this control type can be trained using McodeTrain(); activate it for training with the combination constant M_TRAIN or with M_SET_TRAINING_STATE_ALL. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 2. M_AUTO Specifies to select an appropriate size, automatically. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the minimum dot size, relative to the input coordinate system specified using M_DOT_SIZE_INPUT_UNITS. When entering a value in world units, the number that results from the internal transformation of world units to pixel units must still respect the value's pixel unit constraint. To find the range of allowed values in world units, according to your associated camera calibration, use McalTransformResult(). M_DOT_SPACING_INPUT_UNITS Sets the units with which to interpret the M_DOT_SPACING_MIN and M_DOT_SPACING_MAX control types. This essentially sets the input coordinate system to use. This control type is only available for M_AZTEC, M_DATAMATRIX, M_MAXICODE, M_QRCODE, and M_MICROQRCODE code types. M_DEFAULT Specifies what convention is used, automatically. Same as M_PIXEL. M_PIXEL Specifies to interpret the value in pixel units, with respect to the pixel coordinate system. M_WORLD Specifies to interpret the value in world units, with respect to the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, calling McodeRead() or McodeGrade() generates an error if the operation is not performed on a calibrated image. M_DOT_SPACING_MAX Sets the maximum distance between 2 dots in a matrix code type composed of dots. Note that the value entered represents half the distance between two dark cells (dots). To set the minimum distance between 2 dots, use M_DOT_SPACING_MIN. When the dark cells in a printed code are oversized (for example, due to printing artifacts) and overlap, set M_DOT_SPACING_MAX to a negative value equal to half the width of the overlap. The image below illustrates dark cells overlapping, the gray circle represents the actual cell size, while the black dot represents the expected cell size. By contrast, when the dots are too far apart, specify a positive dot spacing equal to half the distance between the two dots. This control type is only available for M_AZTEC, M_DATAMATRIX, M_MAXICODE, M_QRCODE, and M_MICROQRCODE code types. Note that overestimating this value will severely impair reading results. Note that this control type can be trained using McodeTrain(); activate it for training with the combination constant M_TRAIN or with M_SET_TRAINING_STATE_ALL. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value, which is dependent on the initialization mode. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_IMPROVED_RECOGNITION, the default value is 2. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_TYPICAL_RECOGNITION, the default value is the same as M_DOT_SPACING_MIN. Note that if M_DOT_SPACING_MIN is also set to M_DEFAULT, the result is no spacing. -256 &lt;= Value &lt;= 256 Specifies the distance, relative to the input coordinate system specified using M_DOT_SPACING_INPUT_UNITS. Specifying a positive value means that you are specifying half the distance between the edges of the dots. Specifying a negative value means you are specifying the half-depth of the overlap. If M_DOT_SPACING_INPUT_UNITS is set to M_WORLD, the distance is specified in world units. MIL transforms the value to pixel units according to the camera calibration of the target image that is specified when reading the code occurrence. Whether to use a negative or positive dot spacing is a situation best determined by testing. For more information, refer to the Dot spacing subsection of the Customizing read and grade operation settings section of Chapter 17: Codes. When entering a value in world units, the number that results from the internal transformation of world units to pixel units must still respect the value's pixel unit constraint. To find the range of allowed values in world units, according to your associated camera calibration, use McalTransformResult(). M_DOT_SPACING_MIN Sets the minimum distance between 2 dots in a matrix code type composed of dots. Note that the value entered represents half the distance between two dark cells (dots). For more information, refer to M_DOT_SPACING_MAX. This control type is only available for M_AZTEC, M_DATAMATRIX, M_MAXICODE, M_QRCODE, and M_MICROQRCODE code types. Note that overestimating this value will severely impair reading results. Note that this control type can be trained using McodeTrain(); activate it for training with the combination constant M_TRAIN or with M_SET_TRAINING_STATE_ALL. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value, which is dependent on the initialization mode. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_IMPROVED_RECOGNITION, the default value is the same as -1. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_TYPICAL_RECOGNITION, the default value is the same as M_DOT_SPACING_MAX. Note that if M_DOT_SPACING_MAX is also set to M_DEFAULT, the result is no spacing. -256 &lt;= Value &lt;= 256 Specifies the distance, relative to the input coordinate system specified using M_DOT_SPACING_INPUT_UNITS. Specifying a positive value means that you are specifying half the distance between the edges of the dots. Specifying a negative value means you are specifying the half-depth of the overlap. If M_DOT_SPACING_INPUT_UNITS is set to M_WORLD, the distance is specified in world units. MIL transforms the value to pixel units according to the camera calibration of the target image that is specified when reading the code occurrence. Whether to use a negative or positive dot spacing is a situation best determined by testing. For more information, refer to the Dot spacing subsection of the Customizing read and grade operation settings section of Chapter 17: Codes. When entering a value in pixel units, this value must be between -256 and 256, inclusive. When entering a value in world units, the number that results from the internal transformation of world units to pixel units must still respect the value's pixel unit constraint. To find the range of allowed values in world units, according to your associated camera calibration, use McalTransformResult(). M_ECC_CORRECTED_NUMBER Sets whether McodeRead() or McodeGrade() are forced to perform a more robust operation to minimize the number of errors to correct. Enabling M_ECC_CORRECTED_NUMBER decreases performance, particularly in good quality images or in images where the error count is not important. This control type is only available for M_PDF417 and M_TRUNCATED_PDF417 code types. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies not to perform a more robust operation. M_ENABLE Specifies to perform a more robust operation. M_FINDER_PATTERN_EXHAUSTIVE_SEARCH Sets whether to search for the L-shaped finder pattern (the gray boxed area in the following image) to help localize the Data Matrix code. Note that enabling this control type increases the operation time, but is more reliable when a Data Matrix code has little contrast between foreground and background colors or when dealing with complex images. This control type is only available when M_DECODE_ALGORITHM is set to M_CODE_DEFORMED or when M_USE_PRESEARCH is set to M_FINDER_PATTERN_BASE. In addition, this control type is only available for the M_DATAMATRIX code type. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to not perform an exhaustive search. M_ENABLE Specifies to perform an exhaustive search. M_FINDER_PATTERN_INPUT_UNITS Sets the units with which to interpret the M_FINDER_PATTERN_MAX_GAP and M_FINDER_PATTERN_MINIMUM_LENGTH control types. This essentially sets the input coordinate system to use. This control type is only available when M_DECODE_ALGORITHM is set to M_CODE_DEFORMED or when M_USE_PRESEARCH is set to M_FINDER_PATTERN_BASE. In addition, this control type is only available for the M_DATAMATRIX code type. M_DEFAULT Same as M_PIXEL. M_PIXEL Specifies to interpret the values in pixel units, with respect to the pixel coordinate system. M_WORLD Specifies to interpret the values in world units, with respect to the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, calling McodeRead() or McodeGrade() generates an error if the operation is not performed on a calibrated image. M_FINDER_PATTERN_MAX_GAP Sets the maximum tolerable gap in the finder pattern of a Data Matrix code. A gap is an unintentional space (area of background color), in the solid foreground color area of a M_DATAMATRIX code's finder pattern. A code occurrence that has a finder pattern with a gap larger than the specified value is not read. This control type is only available when M_DECODE_ALGORITHM is set to M_CODE_DEFORMED or when M_USE_PRESEARCH is set to M_FINDER_PATTERN_BASE. In addition, this control type is only available for the M_DATAMATRIX code type. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_AUTO Specifies that the maximum tolerable gap in the finder pattern is 6 times the minimum cell size specified using M_CELL_SIZE_MIN. Value Specifies the maximum gap allowed, in input units specified using M_FINDER_PATTERN_INPUT_UNITS. M_FINDER_PATTERN_MINIMUM_LENGTH Sets the shortest acceptable length of either \"arm\" of the finder pattern of a M_DATAMATRIX code occurrence. If either \"arm\" is shorter than the minimum, the code occurrence is not read. This control type is only available when M_DECODE_ALGORITHM is set to M_CODE_DEFORMED or when M_USE_PRESEARCH is set to M_FINDER_PATTERN_BASE. In addition, this control type is only available for the M_DATAMATRIX code type. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_AUTO Specifies that the minimum acceptable finder pattern \"arm\" length is 6 times the minimum cell size specified using M_CELL_SIZE_MIN. Value The minimum acceptable finder pattern \"arm\" length, in input units specified using M_FINDER_PATTERN_INPUT_UNITS. M_NUMBER Sets the maximum number of code occurrences of the specified code model to read, grade, or train. Note that this number is limited by the specified maximum total number of code occurrences in the image to read, grade, or train (McodeControl() with M_TOTAL_NUMBER). To avoid obtaining false positives when searching for a specific number of occurrences, set M_CODE_SEARCH_MODE to M_BEST. Note that M_BEST is not supported for 2D code types other than the M_DOTCODE code type. The following table lists the code types that support searching for multiple occurrences: Code type Multiple occurrences Linear bar codes (excluding M_GS1_DATABAR, M_4_STATE, M_PLANET, and M_POSTNET) Yes M_DATAMATRIX Yes M_DOTCODE Yes Only the code types in the table above support this control type. When dealing with all other code types, M_NUMBER must be set to 0 or 1 (or M_DEFAULT). Note that this control type can be trained using McodeTrain(); activate it for training with the combination constant M_TRAIN or with M_SET_TRAINING_STATE_ALL. Note that training this control type (M_TRAIN) is only supported for the M_DOTCODE code type. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value, which is dependent on the code type and the initialization mode. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_IMPROVED_RECOGNITION, the default value is 1 for all code types except M_DOTCODE, in which case, the default value is M_ALL. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_TYPICAL_RECOGNITION, the default value is 1. Specifies the default value; the default value is 1. M_ALL Specifies that all code model occurrences are read/graded up to the maximum number limited by M_TOTAL_NUMBER. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the maximum number of code occurrences of the specified code model to read or grade. Only integer values are accepted. Only 1D code types (excluding M_GS1_DATABAR, M_4_STATE, M_PLANET, and M_POSTNET code types), the M_DOTCODE code type, and the M_DATAMATRIX code type support specifying a value greater than 1. M_POSITION_ACCURACY Sets the accuracy of positional results. Accuracy depends on the settings of the code context and its models. It is always recommended to set this control type to M_HIGH when performing an McodeGrade() operation; for higher accuracy, this is also recommended when performing an McodeRead() on multiple code occurrences. Note that this can result in longer read times. This control type must be set to M_HIGH before an McodeRead() operation if you want to use its result for an McodeGrade() operation. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value, which is dependent on the code type and the initialization mode. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_IMPROVED_RECOGNITION, the default value is M_HIGH for all code types except M_DOTCODE, in which case, the default value is M_LOW. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_TYPICAL_RECOGNITION, the default value is M_LOW. M_HIGH Specifies to report the positional results of the code operation with high accuracy. M_LOW Specifies to report the positional results of the code operation with low accuracy. M_SEARCH_ANGLE Sets the nominal search angle. The search is performed between the range of angles defined by: (M_SEARCH_ANGLE - M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_NEG) to (M_SEARCH_ANGLE + M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_POS), inclusively, starting with an angle closest to that of M_SEARCH_ANGLE. For the M_AZTEC, M_DATAMATRIX, M_DOTCODE, M_QRCODE, M_MICROQRCODE, M_MAXICODE, M_PDF417, and M_TRUNCATED_PDF417 code types, the angular range does not affect the speed of the operation. Note that M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_NEG and M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_POS must be set to M_DEFAULT when dealing with the following code types: M_PHARMACODE, M_COMPOSITECODE, and M_MICROPDF417. Their default angular search range will be used. When the search speed M_SPEED is set to M_VERY_LOW, a more exhaustive search algorithm is enabled that can exceed the specified angle range. In this case, the specified angle range is used as a starting reference for the search instead of as a search restriction. Note that this control type can be trained using McodeTrain(); activate it for training with the combination constant M_TRAIN or with M_SET_TRAINING_STATE_ALL. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0 degrees. M_ACCORDING_TO_REGION Specifies that the nominal angle is set to the angle of the target image's ROI (MbufSetRegion()); recall that for McodeGrade() and McodeRead(), the ROI must be rectangular. If this value is chosen but no ROI has been defined, the angle is set to 0.0°. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 360.0 Specifies the nominal angle, in degrees, relative to the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_ANGLE_INPUT_UNITS. An angle interpreted with respect to the pixel coordinate system is always measured counter-clockwise. For information on the angle's direction of rotation when interpreting the angle with respect to the relative coordinate system, see the Angle convention in MIL subsection of the Working with real-world units section of Chapter 28: Calibrating your camera setup. M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_NEG Sets the negative angular range of the search. When M_SEARCH_ANGLE_MODE is enabled, codes are sought at the angular range defined by M_SEARCH_ANGLE - M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_NEG to M_SEARCH_ANGLE + M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_POS. When M_SEARCH_ANGLE_MODE is disabled, this setting has no effect. Note that M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_NEG and M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_POS must be set to M_DEFAULT when dealing with the following code types: M_PHARMACODE and M_COMPOSITECODE. Their default angular search range will be used: Code type Maximum search angle M_PHARMACODE ±5° M_COMPOSITECODE ±5° When the search speed M_SPEED is set to M_VERY_LOW, a more exhaustive search algorithm is enabled that can exceed the specified angle range. In this case, the specified angle range is used as a starting reference for the search instead of as a search restriction. Note that this control type is automatically activated for training if you activate M_SEARCH_ANGLE for training. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value, which is dependent on the code type and the initialization mode. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_IMPROVED_RECOGNITION, the default value is 180.0°. Note that if your code type is M_PHARMACODE or M_COMPOSITECODE, the default value is 5.0°. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_TYPICAL_RECOGNITION, the default value is 5.0°. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 180.0 Specifies a negative angular range, in degrees, relative to the nominal angle set by M_SEARCH_ANGLE. Note that while the nominal angle is relative to the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_ANGLE_INPUT_UNITS, M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_NEG is not affected by the coordinate system used. For 1D codes, the Code module will not use the search angular range algorithm if M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_NEG and M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_POS both have a value of less than 5°, regardless of M_SEARCH_ANGLE_MODE. M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_POS Sets the positive angular range of the search. When M_SEARCH_ANGLE_MODE is enabled, codes are sought at the angular range defined by M_SEARCH_ANGLE - M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_NEG to M_SEARCH_ANGLE + M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_POS. When M_SEARCH_ANGLE_MODE is disabled, this setting has no effect. Note that M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_NEG and M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_POS must be set to M_DEFAULT when dealing with the following code types: M_PHARMACODE and M_COMPOSITECODE. Their default angular search range will be used: Code type Maximum search angle M_PHARMACODE ±5° M_COMPOSITECODE ±5° When the search speed M_SPEED is set to M_VERY_LOW, a more exhaustive search algorithm is enabled that can exceed the specified angle range. In this case, the specified angle range is used as a starting reference for the search instead of as a search restriction. Note that this control type is automatically activated for training if you activate M_SEARCH_ANGLE for training. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value, which is dependent on the code type and the initialization mode. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_IMPROVED_RECOGNITION, the default value is 180.0°. Note that if your code type is M_PHARMACODE or M_COMPOSITECODE, the default value is 5.0°. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_TYPICAL_RECOGNITION, the default value is 5.0°. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 180.0 Specifies a positive angular range, in degrees, relative to the nominal angle set by M_SEARCH_ANGLE. Note that while the nominal angle is relative to the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_ANGLE_INPUT_UNITS, M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_POS is not affected by the coordinate system used. For 1D codes, the Code module will not use the search angular range algorithm if M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_NEG and M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_POS both have a value of less than 5°, regardless of M_SEARCH_ANGLE_MODE. M_SEARCH_ANGLE_INPUT_UNITS Sets the units with which to interpret the M_SEARCH_ANGLE control type. This essentially sets the input coordinate system to use. M_DEFAULT Same as M_PIXEL. M_PIXEL Specifies to interpret the value in pixel units, with respect to the pixel coordinate system. M_WORLD Specifies to interpret the value in world units, with respect to the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, calling McodeRead() or McodeGrade() generates an error if the operation is not performed on a calibrated image. If there is distortion in the target image, you should correct the image before performing an McodeRead() or McodeGrade() operation. M_SEARCH_ANGLE_STEP Sets the angle increment/decrement used when searching for codes through an angular range. When M_SEARCH_ANGLE_STEP is enabled, the search angular range algorithm will first search at the specified nominal angle. It will then toggle between incrementing and decrementing from the nominal angle, with each iteration moving further away from the initial search angle by the value of M_SEARCH_ANGLE_STEP. The process will continue either until the code is found, or the search falls outside of the range defined by M_SEARCH_ANGLE - M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_NEG and M_SEARCH_ANGLE + M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_POS. Note that setting the M_SEARCH_ANGLE_STEP will affect both the speed and robustness of the search. Note that this control type is ignored if M_SPEED is set to M_VERY_LOW, or M_SEARCH_ANGLE_MODE is set to M_DISABLE. This control type is available for 1D code types (excluding M_4_STATE, M_PLANET, and M_POSTNET). It is also available for M_PDF417 and M_TRUNCATED_PDF417 code types when M_DECODE_ALGORITHM is set to M_SCANLINE_AT_ANGLE. Note that for M_PDF417 and M_TRUNCATED_PDF417 code types, this control type is automatically activated for training if you activate M_SEARCH_ANGLE for training. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that no explicit increment/decrement is used. The actual increment/decrement used during the search is determined by the search angular range algorithm. 0.1 &lt;= Value &lt;= 180.0 Specifies the explicit angle increment/decrement, in degrees. M_STRING_SIZE_MAX Sets the maximum size (number of characters) of the string encoded in a code occurrence. For M_QRCODE, M_MICROQRCODE, M_COMPOSITECODE, and M_GS1_DATABAR code types, the maximum string size is ignored when performing McodeRead() and McodeGrade() operations. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value, which is dependent on the code type. For the M_IATA25 code type, the default value is 15. For all other code types, the default value is M_ANY. M_ANY Specifies that there is no maximum string size. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 65535 Specifies the maximum string size. For a 1D code (except M_POSTNET, M_PLANET and M_CODABAR codes), the range of possible values starts at 1. For a M_POSTNET code, the value must be either 5, 9, or 11. For a M_PLANET code, the value must be 11 or 13. For a M_CODABAR code, the value must be at least 3. For all 2D codes and cross-row codes (except M_AZTEC with M_ENCODING set to M_ENC_AZTEC_RUNE and M_MAXICODE with M_ENCODING set to either M_ENC_MODE2 or M_ENC_MODE3) the value can start at 0. Only integer values are accepted. M_STRING_SIZE_MIN Sets the minimum size (number of characters) of the string encoded in a code occurrence. For M_QRCODE, M_MICROQRCODE, M_COMPOSITECODE, and M_GS1_DATABAR code types, the minimum string size is ignored when performing McodeRead() and McodeGrade() operations. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value, which is dependent on the code type. For the M_IATA25 code type, the default value is 15. For all other code types, the default value is M_ANY. M_ANY Specifies that there is no minimum string size. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 65535 Specifies the minimum string size. For a 1D code (except M_POSTNET, M_PLANET and M_CODABAR codes), the range of possible values starts at 1. For a M_POSTNET code, the value must be either 5, 9, or 11. For a M_PLANET code, the value must be 11 or 13. For a M_CODABAR code, the value must be at least 3. For all 2D codes and cross-row codes (except M_AZTEC with M_ENCODING set to M_ENC_AZTEC_RUNE and M_MAXICODE with M_ENCODING set to either M_ENC_MODE2 or M_ENC_MODE3) the value can start at 0. Only integer values are accepted. M_SUB_TYPE Sets the particular code sub-types for which to search. Enabling fewer sub-types will help increase the speed of the operation. Some versions of M_GS1_DATABAR codes only differ by their bar height and not their structure. In these cases, the operation is successful even if only one of the sub-types is enabled. For example, GS1 Databar Omnidirectional and GS1 Databar Truncated can be decoded if either M_GS1_DATABAR_OMNI or M_GS1_DATABAR_TRUNCATED is enabled. The sub-types are additive. If you set the sub-type to M_UPC_A + M_GS1_DATABAR_OMNI, you can search for M_UPC_A and M_GS1_DATABAR codes. If you enabled other sub-types previously, they are no longer enabled. This value is available only for M_GS1_DATABAR and M_COMPOSITECODE code types. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ANY. M_ANY Specifies to search for all of the code sub-types that can be specified for M_SUB_TYPE. M_EAN8 Specifies that the EAN 8 code sub-type is enabled. M_COMPOSITECODE is the only code type that supports this setting. M_EAN13 Specifies that the EAN 13 code sub-type is enabled. M_COMPOSITECODE is the only code type that supports this setting. M_GS1_128 Specifies that the GS1-128 code sub-type is enabled. M_COMPOSITECODE is the only code type that supports this setting. M_GS1_DATABAR_EXPANDED Specifies that the GS1 Databar Expanded code sub-type is enabled. M_GS1_DATABAR_EXPANDED_STACKED Specifies that the GS1 Databar Expanded Stacked code sub-type is enabled. M_GS1_DATABAR_LIMITED Specifies that the GS1 Databar Limited code sub-type is enabled. M_GS1_DATABAR_OMNI Specifies that the GS1 Databar Omnidirectional code sub-type is enabled. M_GS1_DATABAR_STACKED Specifies that the GS1 Databar Stacked code sub-type is enabled. M_GS1_DATABAR_STACKED_OMNI Specifies that the GS1 Databar Stacked Omnidirectional code sub-type is enabled. M_GS1_DATABAR_TRUNCATED Specifies that the GS1 Databar Truncated code sub-type is enabled. M_UPC_A Specifies that the UPC-A code sub-type is enabled. M_COMPOSITECODE is the only code type that supports this setting. M_UPC_E Specifies that the UPC-E code sub-type is enabled. M_COMPOSITECODE is the only code type that supports this setting. M_USE_PRESEARCH Sets whether the localization operation is performed prior to the decoding step of an operation. Note that, when reading multiple occurrences of M_DATAMATRIX codes, the setting of this control type is ignored. This control type is available for 2D code types, excluding the M_DOTCODE code type. Note that this control type can be trained using McodeTrain(); activate it for training with the combination constant M_TRAIN or with M_SET_TRAINING_STATE_ALL. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value, which is dependent on the code type and the initialization mode. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_IMPROVED_RECOGNITION and the code type is M_DATAMATRIX, the default value is M_FINDER_PATTERN_BASE. For supported 2D code types other than M_DATAMATRIX, the default value is M_STAT_BASE. When using a code context with M_INITIALIZATION_MODE set to M_TYPICAL_RECOGNITION, the default value is M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that the operation is not performed. M_FINDER_PATTERN_BASE Specifies that the localization operation is only performed on the base pattern of the M_DATAMATRIX code (an \"L\" starting at the top-most left corner, and ending on the bottom-most right corner of the code). This localization operation is more robust than an M_STAT_BASE localization operation. Note that if the surrounding image is very complex, better results might be obtained by setting M_FINDER_PATTERN_EXHAUSTIVE_SEARCH to M_ENABLE. M_DATAMATRIX is the only code type that supports this setting. M_STAT_BASE Specifies to localize the code within the image with the statistical characteristics of a 2D bar code (for example, local variance and the presence of a lot of edges). This localization operation is performed faster than an M_FINDER_PATTERN_BASE localization operation. Note that this localization operation might be less efficient when a code occurrence's cell size is greater than a particular value, depending on the code type. To obtain the best results from this operation, you should specify the cell size as a range, using M_CELL_SIZE_MIN and M_CELL_SIZE_MAX, when the cell sizes of the codes in your images are greater than the cell sizes listed in the table below. If they are less than or equal to these values, you can leave M_CELL_SIZE_MIN and M_CELL_SIZE_MAX to their default values. Code type Cell size Aztec 9 MicroPDF417 4 PDF417/Truncated PDF417 7 QR code 8 Note that unlisted code types have no known cell size limitations. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be specified for a code model to control an McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), McodeTrain(), or McodeWrite() operation. If you pass a code context to the CodeId parameter, the specified control type setting is applied to all the code models in the context. If none of the code models support the specified control type, an error occurs. If only some code models do not support the specified control type, the control type setting is ignored for these code models. Note that besides code type restrictions listed explicitly in the values below, McodeGrade() does not support M_4_STATE, M_PHARMACODE, M_POSTNET, and M_PLANET code types. Although all these control types affect the results of McodeTrain(), see the description of the control types to determine if they can be activated for training; you can also use filters to limit the control types in the table to those that can be trained. Code model settings for an McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), McodeTrain(), or McodeWrite() operation ControlType Description ControlValue M_CELL_NUMBER_X Sets the number of cells of a 2D code in the X-direction. Note that setting the number of cells in both the X- and Y-direction, increases the robustness of the operation. Note that McodeControl() generates an error if you set both a range of cells for which to search (using M_CELL_NUMBER_X_MAX, M_CELL_NUMBER_X_MIN, M_CELL_NUMBER_Y_MAX, and/or M_CELL_NUMBER_Y_MIN) and an explicit number of cells for which to search (using M_CELL_NUMBER_X and/or M_CELL_NUMBER_Y). This control type is only used for 2D code types. The number of cells is not required for M_MAXICODE because it is a fixed size. Note that this control type can be trained using McodeTrain(); activate it for training with the combination constant M_TRAIN or with M_SET_TRAINING_STATE_ALL. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ANY.

To find the range of allowed values in world units, according to your associated camera calibration, use McalTransformResult(). The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be specified when dealing with an McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), McodeDetect(), McodeTrain(), or McodeWrite() operation. Result buffer settings dealing with an McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), McodeDetect(), McodeTrain(), or McodeWrite() operation ControlType Description ControlValue M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS Sets whether to return results in pixels or world units. This essentially sets the output coordinate system to use. The setting of this control type will only affect functions within this module which return positional results. This control type can be changed at any time to return results in the required output units. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ACCORDING_TO_CALIBRATION. M_ACCORDING_TO_CALIBRATION Specifies that results are returned in world units if the result was calculated on an image associated with a camera calibration context; otherwise, specifies that results are returned in pixel units. M_PIXEL Specifies that results are returned in pixel units, with respect to the pixel coordinate system. M_WORLD Specifies that results are returned in world units, with respect to the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, calling McodeGetResult() generates an error if the result was not calculated on a calibrated image. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be specified when dealing with an McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), McodeTrain(), or McodeWrite() operation. Result buffer settings dealing with an McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), McodeTrain(), or McodeWrite() operation ControlType Description ControlValue M_STRING_FORMAT Sets the format in which to return the string, retrieved using McodeGetResult() with M_STRING. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO_FORMAT. M_AUTO_FORMAT Specifies that the string is returned in the string format associated with the code type. Graphical interpretations are assigned depending on corresponding character sets, allowing for the use of character set ECIs. M_GS1_HUMAN_READABLE Specifies that the string is returned in a format that is human-readable. Note that this is the default format for both a M_EAN14 and M_GS1_128 code type.

Syntax void McodeDetect( MIL_ID&nbsp;ImageBufId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;SizeOfCodeTypeArray, //in const MIL_INT&nbsp;*CodeTypeArrayPtr, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;NumCodesToDetect, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;TimeoutValue, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DetectResultCodeId //in ) Description This function detects code occurrences of most 1D code types in a specified image. It detects their code type and encoding scheme; it also establishes their position with high accuracy. You can automatically add a code model for each detected code type to a code context, using McodeModel() with M_RESET_FROM_DETECTED_RESULTS. Alternatively, you can use the detected code type and encoding scheme information to manually set up your code models with an appropriate code type and encoding scheme for the code occurrences in your images. You can retrieve results using McodeGetResult(). Retrieve the code type and encoding scheme with M_CODE_TYPE and M_ENCODING, respectively. Prior to retrieving other results, you should ensure that McodeDetect() was successful by verifying that M_STATUS returns M_STATUS_DETECT_OK. Some code types are a subset of another. If a code occurrence has only the common features of these code types, McodeDetect() cannot distinguish if the code occurrence is of one type or the other at decode-time. In these cases, McodeDetect() reports the following: When the following code types cannot be differentiated Code type reported M_UPC_A and M_EAN13 M_UPC_A M_EAN14, M_GS1_128, and M_CODE128 M_EAN14 M_GS1_128 and M_CODE128 M_GS1_128 You can remove this ambiguity by restricting the possible code types with CodeTypeArrayPtr. Another reason to restrict the possible code types is if you are not interested in detecting certain code types; this will accelerate the McodeDetect() operation. Note that this function does not detect postal, GS1 Databar, Pharmacode, 2D, or composite code types. For the list of code types supported by McodeDetect(), use McodeInquire() with M_SUPPORTED_CODE_TYPES_DETECT. This function tries to detect the specified number of code occurrences. If it detects more than the specified number of code occurrences in the specified image, the function only stores the results of those with the best quality. If it detects less than the specified number, McodeGetResult() with M_STATUS returns M_STATUS_DETECT_FAILED. Parameters Parameters ImageBufId Specifies the identifier of an image buffer that contains the code occurrences to detect. The image buffer must be an 8-bit unsigned 1-band buffer. This image buffer can only have a rectangular region of interest (ROI) defined using MbufSetRegion() (with or without rotation). The region must be defined in vector format from a 2D graphics list (M_VECTOR or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error will be generated if the ROI is only in raster format (M_RASTER) or a non-rectangular shape. SizeOfCodeTypeArray Specifies the size of the array passed to CodeTypeArrayPtr. When using a standard vector (std::vector) overload function in C++, you can pass M_DEFAULT to this parameter and MIL will automatically determine the size based on the number of items in the vector passed to the CodeTypeArrayPtr parameter. For specifying the size of the code type array Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. Value = 0 Specifies that an array is not passed to CodeTypeArrayPtr. McodeDetect() will search for all code types supported by it. This value is only applicable when CodeTypeArrayPtr is set to M_NULL. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the size of the array. CodeTypeArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(SizeOfCodeTypeArray) Specifies the address of an array listing the possible code types to detect in the image. Instead of passing an array with M_SUPPORTED_CODE_TYPES_DETECT, you can set this parameter to M_NULL and set SizeOfCodeTypeArray to 0. If an array is passed to CodeTypeArrayPtr, it can contain one or more of the following values to specify which code types to look for: For specifying the code types to detect Value Description M_BC412 Specifies a BC412 code type. M_CODABAR Specifies a Codabar code type. M_CODE39 Specifies a Code 39 code type. M_CODE93 Specifies a Code 93 code type. M_CODE128 Specifies a Code 128 code type. M_EAN8 Specifies an EAN 8 code type. M_EAN13 Specifies an EAN 13 code type. M_EAN14 Specifies an EAN 14 code type. M_GS1_128 Specifies a GS1-128 code type. M_IATA25 Specifies an IATA 2 of 5 code type. M_INDUSTRIAL25 Specifies an Industrial 2 of 5 (standard 2 of 5) code type. M_INTERLEAVED25 Specifies an Interleaved 2 of 5 (ITF-14) code type. M_SUPPORTED_CODE_TYPES_DETECT Specifies all 1D code types supported by this function. M_UPC_A Specifies a UPC-A code type. M_UPC_E Specifies a UPC-E code type. NumCodesToDetect Specifies the total number of code occurrences to detect in the image, regardless of their code type. For specifying the number of code occurrences to detect Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the number of code occurrences to detect. TimeoutValue Specifies the timeout period, in msec. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. DetectResultCodeId Specifies the code detect result buffer in which to write the results. The result buffer must have been allocated using McodeAllocResult() with M_CODE_DETECT_RESULT.

Parameters Parameters ContextGraId Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics context to use when drawing. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For specifying the 2D graphics context Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the default 2D graphics context of the current MIL application is used. Note that there is a different default 2D graphics context for each thread. MIL 2D graphics context identifier Specifies a valid 2D graphics context identifier, which you have allocated using MgraAlloc(). ResultCodeId Specifies the identifier of the code read, grade, or detect result buffer from which to extract features to draw. The code result buffer must have been previously allocated on the required system using McodeAllocResult() with M_CODE_READ_RESULT, M_CODE_GRADE_RESULT, M_CODE_WRITE_RESULT, or M_CODE_DETECT_RESULT. DstImageBufOrListGraId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer or 2D graphics list in which to draw specific features of results. If specifying an image buffer, it must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. The image buffer must be an 8-bit, unsigned, 1-band image buffer, allocated using MbufAlloc...(). In general, the destination image buffer should be the same size as the image that you just read. For the M_DRAW_REFLECTANCE_PROFILE and M_DRAW_SCAN_PROFILES drawing operations, determine the required image buffer width using McodeGetResult() with M_SCAN_REFLECTANCE_PROFILE_LENGTH. For best results for a M_DRAW_REFLECTANCE_PROFILE drawing operation, the image buffer must have a height of at least 256. If you specify a 2D graphics list, the 2D graphics list must have been previously allocated using MgraAllocList(). By drawing into the display's overlay buffer or associating the 2D graphics list with the display, you can also annotate an image non-destructively. Operation Specifies the type of drawing operation to perform. Drawing operations can be added together to draw multiple features at a time. For example, to draw both the result occurrence's position and code symbol as it was read using McodeRead(), set the Operation parameter to M_DRAW_POSITION + M_DRAW_CODE. The following drawing operations are only available after performing an McodeRead() or McodeGrade() operation. For specifying the type of drawing operation after an McodeRead()or McodeGrade() operation Value Description M_DRAW_CODE Draws the specified code occurrence as it was read by McodeRead() or McodeGrade(). This drawing operation is not supported for GS1 Databar, MicroPDF417, and composite code types. M_DRAW_DECODED_SCANS Draws the specified decoded scanline(s) that an McodeRead() or McodeGrade() operation used to read the specified code occurrence(s). The scanlines are drawn using their start and end points (McodeGetResult() with M_DECODED_SCANS_START... and M_DECODED_SCANS_END...). You can specify the scanline for which to draw results using ScanIndex. This drawing operation is available for linear and composite code types. For composite code types, only the scanlines in the 1D portion of the code occurrence(s) are drawn. The following types of drawing operations are only available after performing an McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), McodeWrite() operation. For specifying the type of drawing operation after an McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), McodeWrite() operation Value Description M_DRAW_POSITION Draws a cross-like symbol at the mid-point of the code occurrence. Note that for a Data Matrix code occurrence, after an McodeRead() or McodeGrade() operation, the cross symbol is drawn in the middle of the top-left cell. For a composite code occurrence, the cross is drawn at the midpoint of the 1D part of the code. For a Maxicode code occurrence, the cross appears in the center of the bull's eye pattern. Regardless of the code type, the cross is drawn maintaining the angle of the occurrence. The following types of drawing operations are only available after performing an McodeGrade() operation. For specifying the type of drawing operation after an McodeGrade() operation Value Description M_DRAW_EXTENDED_AREA Draws a box around the specified code occurrence, including its extended area, as analyzed by the McodeGrade() operation. Note that this drawing operation is only available if M_EXTENDED_AREA_REFLECTANCE_CHECK was enabled for the McodeGrade() operation. To establish the dimensions of occurrence with its extended area, use McodeGetResult() with M_EXTENDED_AREA_TOP... and M_EXTENDED_AREA_BOTTOM.... This drawing operation is available for Aztec, Data Matrix, QR code, and Micro QR code types. M_DRAW_REFLECTANCE_PROFILE Draws the scan reflectance profile of the specified scanline(s) of the code occurrence, as analyzed by the McodeGrade() operation. You can specify the scanline for which to draw results using ScanIndex. The result is not scaled to the size of the destination image buffer. For best results, the image buffer must have a height of at least 256. M_DRAW_SCAN_PROFILES Draws the specified scanline(s) analyzed in the code occurrence by the McodeGrade() operation. You can specify the scanline for which to draw results using ScanIndex. The drawn scanline(s) represents only the region(s) from which the results were successfully located. Combination values that can be used alone or as combination values for Tables: For specifying the type of drawing operation after an McodeRead()or McodeGrade() operation For specifying the type of drawing operation after an McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), McodeWrite() operation For specifying the type of drawing operation after an McodeGrade() operation the values listed in all the values group tables. You can use one or more of the following values in combination with each other or with the above-mentioned values, to specify a drawing operation that is available after an McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), McodeWrite(), or McodeDetect() operation. Refer to individual values for usage details after specific code operations. For specifying a drawing operation that is available after either an McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), McodeWrite(), or McodeDetect() operation Value Description M_DRAW_BOX Draws a box around the code occurrence. This box is drawn according to the corner coordinates of the code occurrence. You can retrieve these coordinates using McodeGetResult() with M_BOTTOM... and M_TOP.... The box only contains the part of the code occurrence that was processed; for occurrences of 1D code types from an McodeRead() operation performed in low accuracy (McodeControl() with M_POSITION_ACCURACY set to M_LOW), this means that the box might not encompass the entire code occurrence. The box is drawn maintaining the angle and scale of the occurrence. When dealing with composite code occurrences (only supported by McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), and McodeWrite() operations), the box is drawn around the 1D component of the code occurrence. To draw the box around the 2D component of a code occurrence, combine M_DRAW_BOX with M_2D_COMPONENT. Note that after an McodeDetect() operation, you must use this value alone; it cannot be used in combination with any other value. M_DRAW_QUIET_ZONE Draws a box around the specified code occurrence, including its quiet zone, as analyzed by the McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), or McodeWrite() operation. The box is drawn maintaining the angle and scale of the occurrence. To establish the dimensions of occurrence with its quiet zone, use McodeGetResult() with M_QUIET_ZONE_TOP... and M_QUIET_ZONE_BOTTOM.... The box only contains the part of the code occurrence that was processed; for occurrences of 1D code types from an McodeRead() operation performed in low accuracy (McodeControl() with M_POSITION_ACCURACY set to M_LOW), this means that the box might not encompass the entire code occurrence or might include white space. Note that this drawing operation is not available after an McodeDetect() operation. Combination values for M_DRAW_POSITION , M_DRAW_REFLECTANCE_PROFILE , M_DRAW_SCAN_PROFILES , M_DRAW_BOX , M_DRAW_QUIET_ZONE. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to specify the component of a composite code occurrence for which to draw McodeGrade() results. These values are only available when the ResultCodeId parameter is set to the identifier of a code grade result buffer. For specifying the component of a composite code occurrence for which to perform the drawing after an McodeGrade() operation Combination value Description M_LINEAR_COMPONENT Draws the grading result for the 1D component (linear component) of a composite code occurrence. M_2D_COMPONENT Draws the grading result for the 2D component of a composite code occurrence. ResultIndex Specifies the code occurrence for which to draw results. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the occurrence index of the code result Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_ALL. M_ALL Performs the specified operation for all code occurrences in the code result buffer. 0 &lt;= OccurrenceIndex &lt; M_NUMBER Specifies the index of the code occurrence in the code result buffer. See the Retrieving results section of Chapter 17: Codes for more information on code occurrence indices. ScanIndex Specifies the scanline(s) for which to draw results. Note that specifying a scanline is only applicable to drawing operations that draw results for specified scanlines (for example, M_DRAW_REFLECTANCE_PROFILE or M_DRAW_SCAN_PROFILES). For all other drawing operations, set this parameter to M_GENERAL. If specifying both a scanline-specific drawing operation and a general drawing operation (for example, M_DRAW_REFLECTANCE_PROFILE + M_DRAW_CODE), set this parameter to the scanline(s) for which to draw results instead of passing M_GENERAL. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the scanline Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value. For a scanline-specific drawing operation, this value is the same as M_ALL. For a general drawing operation, this value is the same as M_GENERAL. M_ALL Specifies to perform the scanline-specific drawing operation for all scanlines of the specified code occurrence(s). M_GENERAL Specifies to perform the drawing operation without specifying a scanline. Note that this value is not supported for the M_DRAW_REFLECTANCE_PROFILE and M_DRAW_SCAN_PROFILES drawing operations. 0 &lt;= Value &lt; M_NUMBER_OF_DECODED_SCANS Specifies the index of the decoded scanline for which to perform the drawing operation, for the specified code occurrence. Note that this value cannot be used if ResultIndex is set to M_ALL or M_DEFAULT. 0 &lt;= Value &lt; M_NUMBER_OF_SCANS Specifies the index of the scanline for which to perform the drawing operation, for the specified code occurrence. Note that this value cannot be used if ResultIndex is set to M_ALL or M_DEFAULT. ControlFlag Specifies the function's control flag. Reserved for future expansion. This parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. Remark The prototype of this function changed as of MIL 10 PP4. For C applications, by default the original prototype is used to ensure backward-compatibility. To use the updated prototype, add #define M_USE_OLD_MCODE_API_IN_C 0 before including mil.h.

For results from an McodeGrade() operation, you can also retrieve a result for a specific scanline or row of a specified code occurrence. In some cases, you can also retrieve the specified result for all occurrences, or in the case of McodeTrain(), for all code models. The order in which these results are returned depends on the code operation that returned them. Use M_CODE_MODEL_ID to establish the corresponding code model of each returned result (or set of results for result types that return multiple values such as M_DATA_CODEWORDS). For more information on the order in which results are returned, see the Retrieving results section of Chapter 15: Codes. The code operation must have been performed prior to calling McodeGetResult(); otherwise, an error will occur. Besides code type restrictions listed explicitly in the result types below, keep in mind that McodeGrade() does not support M_4_STATE, M_PHARMACODE, M_POSTNET, and M_PLANET code types. The results from an McodeTrain() operation are the recommended control type settings for a code context and its code models, based on the occurrences found in all the training images. To retrieve the results of the read operation that McodeTrain() internally performed on each training image, use M_CODE_RESULT_ID. This retrieves the identifiers of internal code read result buffers; there is one per training image. You can then pass McodeGetResult() one of these result buffer identifiers and retrieve any type of result available for an McodeRead() operation. From an McodeGrade() operation, a resulting quality grade (such as, M_CONTRAST_UNIFORMITY_GRADE) is typically based on a calculation described in the standard selected using McodeControl() with M_GRADING_STANDARD. The calculation returns one result per codeword or one result per code occurrence, depending on what was being graded. In most cases, there is a non-grade result which has more information about the test performed (such as, M_CONTRAST_UNIFORMITY). The grade is based on a scale from 4.0 to 0.0 that is converted to an alphabetic grade (A through F). When dealing with results that are derived from other results, retrieve the results for the associated results first. For example, before retrieving M_SCAN_DEFECTS, retrieve M_SCAN_ERN_MAXIMUM and M_SCAN_SYMBOL_CONTRAST. This assists in narrowing down where your code occurrence (or potentially the configuration of your code context) is lacking. If your target image was associated with a camera calibration context, positional and dimensional results are, by default, returned with respect to the relative coordinate system of the image. Otherwise, these results are returned in pixels, relative to the top-left pixel in the target image. If your target image was associated with a camera calibration context but you want to retrieve positional and dimensional results in pixel units, use McodeControl() with the M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS control type set to M_PIXEL. However, note that if you set M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS to M_WORLD without specifying a calibrated target image in which to calculate the results, McodeGetResult() will generate an error. Note that McodeGetResult() in combination with McodeWrite() can be used to determine the required image buffer size to encode a given string. First, call McodeWrite() with ImageBufId set to M_NULL and then call McodeGetResult() to retrieve the minimum width (M_WRITE_SIZE_X) and height (M_WRITE_SIZE_Y) required to draw the code. For simplicity, the codes drawn using McodeWrite() are referred to as \"code occurrences\" in the ResultType tables below. Parameters Parameters ResultCodeId Specifies the identifier of the code result buffer from which to retrieve results. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ResultIndex Specifies the code occurrence(s) or code model(s) for which to retrieve results. For specifying the occurrence or model index Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value. For code occurrence-specific or code model-specific result types, this value is the same as M_ALL. For other result types, this value is the same as M_GENERAL. M_ALL Specifies to get results related to all code occurrences. Note that when this value is used, results from an McodeDetect(), McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), or McodeWrite() operation are returned in the order in which the code occurrences were found, regardless of the code model/code type. M_GENERAL Specifies to get general results related to all code occurrences, or in the case of McodeTrain(), the recommended control type settings for the code context. Note that the order in which these results are returned depends on the code operation that returned them. 0 &lt;= CodeModelIndex &lt; M_NUMBER_OF_CODE_MODELS Specifies the index of the code model in the McodeTrain() result buffer from which to retrieve results. Code models are indexed in the result buffer in the same order as they were added to the training context. Use M_CODE_MODEL_ID to establish the corresponding code model identifier. See the Retrieving results section of Chapter 17: Codes for more information on result indices. 0 &lt;= CodeOccurrenceIndex &lt; M_NUMBER Specifies the index of the code occurrence in the McodeRead(), McodeGrade(), or McodeDetect() result buffer from which to retrieve results. Code occurrences are indexed in the result buffer in the order in which they were found, regardless of the code model/code type. Use M_CODE_MODEL_ID and M_CODE_TYPE to establish the corresponding code model and code type, respectively. See the Retrieving results section of Chapter 17: Codes for more information on result indices. RowOrScanIndex Specifies the scanline(s) or row(s) of the code occurrence in the McodeGrade() result buffer for which to retrieve results. For result types that are not scanline-specific or row-specific, set this parameter to M_GENERAL or M_DEFAULT. For specifying the scanline result index or row result index Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value. For a scanline-specific or row-specific result type, this value is the same as M_ALL. For other result types, this value is the same as M_GENERAL. M_ALL Specifies to retrieve the results related to all scanlines or rows of the specified code occurrence. M_GENERAL Specifies to retrieve general results. 0 &lt;= Value &lt; M_NUMBER_OF_ROWS Specifies the row for which to retrieve results of the specified code occurrence. 2D cross-row code types, composite code types, and the stacked sub-types of the GS1 Databar code type have multiple rows; the remaining 1D code types have one row. Note that this value cannot be used if ResultIndex is set to M_ALL or M_DEFAULT. 0 &lt;= Value &lt; M_NUMBER_OF_SCANS Specifies the scanline for which to retrieve results of the specified code occurrence. Note that this value cannot be used if ResultIndex is set to M_ALL or M_DEFAULT. ResultType Specifies the type of result to retrieve. Not all result types are available for all operations; the availability of results depends on which operation has been performed. In the tables below, the result types are grouped according to the operations after which they are available. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. UserVarArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] array of type MIL_ID [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_ID&gt; ] array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] array of type MIL_INT32 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT32&gt; ] array of type MIL_INT64 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT64&gt; ] array of type MIL_TEXT_CHAR [optionally, in C++: a reference to a MIL_STRING] MIL_DOUBLE MIL_ID MIL_INT MIL_INT32 MIL_INT64 MIL_TEXT_CHAR Specifies the address in which to place the specified result.

M_STATUS Retrieves the status of the McodeDetect() operation. It can be helpful to retrieve the number of code occurrences by calling M_NUMBER, along with the status. For example, if you specify that the McodeDetect() operation should detect two code occurrences (NumCodesToDetect) and only one was detected, the status returned is M_STATUS_DETECT_FAILED. Calling M_NUMBER will return 1.

For example, if you set an McodeRead() operation to read two code occurrences (McodeControl() with M_NUMBER) and only one was found, the status returned is M_STATUS_NOT_FOUND. Calling M_NUMBER will return 1. If the operation that produced the results expected to operate on multiple code occurrences (McodeControl() with M_NUMBER) and it incurred an error for more than one, the least-common error is returned. For example, if you set an McodeRead() operation to read two code occurrences and one fails because the code was not found (M_STATUS_NOT_FOUND) and the other fails because the encoding type was unknown (M_STATUS_ENC_UNKNOWN), the latter is returned.

The difference between the actual code and the theoretical code model. For 1D Planet, Postnet, and 4-state code types, the score is 1 if the code was read and 0 if it was not. For 2D code types, the score is calculated using: 1 - (Number of errors)/(Number of error correction codewords). If the code could not be decoded successfully, the score is 0. For 2D cross-row types, the score is calculated using: 1 - (Number of errors + Number of erasures)/(Number of codewords). If the code could not be decoded successfully, the score is 0. For the M_DATAMATRIX code type, the score is calculated using: 1 - (Number of errors + Number of erasures)/(Number of error correction codewords). If the code could not be decoded successfully, the score is 0. For composite codes, the score is the score of either the 1D part or the 2D part; whichever was lower. To retrieve the error status of the McodeGrade() operation, use M_STATUS. To retrieve the confidence score of an McodeGrade() operation as a grade, use M_OVERALL_SYMBOL_GRADE.

Syntax void McodeGrade( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextCodeId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;ImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcResultCodeId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;SrcModelCodeIndexOrResultIndex, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstResultCodeId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function computes different quality-grades for the code occurrences in an image, as specified in the code context, and writes the results in the destination result buffer. Retrieve results using McodeGetResult(). McodeGrade() can also grade code occurrences found using McodeRead(). Note that McodeGrade() does not support M_4_STATE, M_PHARMACODE, M_POSTNET, and M_PLANET code types. By default, McodeGrade() internally performs a code read operation before performing the code grade operation. However, you can skip this step if you pass McodeGrade() the result buffer from a previous successful call to McodeRead(); this is more efficient if for some reason, you need to explicitly call McodeRead() prior to calling McodeGrade(). In this case for all code types except 2D matrix, ensure that McodeRead() was executed with the control type M_POSITION_ACCURACY set to high to avoid potential failure. Since the global context settings are required, McodeGrade() requires that you pass a code context identifier, and not a code model identifier. The code context passed to McodeGrade() can contain multiple code models depending on their code type (see McodeModel() for details). McodeGrade() can grade one or more occurrences of 1D and Data Matrix code models; for other types of code models, McodeGrade() can grade at most one occurrence. If a target image is specified and the code context contains multiple code models, you can grade all the occurrences of a specific code model or grade all the occurrences of all the code models (M_ALL). If a source code result buffer is specified and it contains the results of several code occurrences, you can specify the index of the code occurrence to grade or grade all the occurrences (M_ALL). Before calling McodeGrade(), ensure that the following control types are set appropriately for your code occurrences. Control type Notes M_FOREGROUND_VALUE Specifies the foreground color of the code occurrence. This control type must be set if the foreground color is not black; the code occurrence will not be graded if the foreground value is not correctly set. M_ENCODING Specifies the type of encoding scheme for the code occurrence. This control type must be set if the default encoding scheme for the code type differs from the one used by the code occurrence or if M_ANY is not supported. M_ERROR_CORRECTION Specifies the type of error correction scheme for the code occurrence. This control type must be set if the default error correction scheme for the code type differs from the one used by the code occurrence or if M_ANY is not supported. M_STRING_SIZE.... Specifies the maximum and minimum size of the string (number of characters) encoded in each code occurrence. These control types must be set if M_STRING_SIZE_MIN and/or M_STRING_SIZE_MAX cannot be set to M_ANY. M_SEARCH_ANGLE.... Specifies the nominal search angle and angular search range. These control types must be set if the code occurrence is at an angle greater or less than 0.0 ±5 degrees. For more information on code model and code context settings that can improve results, see the Customizing read and grade operation settings section of Chapter 17: Codes. If you have associated the target image with a camera calibration context, you can specify that certain input settings be interpreted in world units. To do so, use McodeControl() with M_ABSOLUTE_APERTURE_SIZE_INPUT_UNITS, M_SCANLINE_INPUT_UNITS, M_DOT_SPACING_INPUT_UNITS, M_SEARCH_ANGLE_INPUT_UNITS, and/or M_CELL_SIZE_INPUT_UNITS set to M_WORLD. Note that if you set any of these constants to M_WORLD but you don't pass McodeGrade() a calibrated target image, the function will generate an error. If you pass a source code result buffer to McodeGrade() instead of a target image, the code context should have the same settings as the context passed to McodeRead(); the settings should not be changed between the two operations. A source code result buffer (passed to this function) should contain results obtained from a calibrated target image for best results. It is strongly recommended to use a region of interest (ROI), set using MbufSetRegion(), with McodeGrade(), especially if your image contains more code occurrences than your context is configured to grade; otherwise, MIL will randomly select the specified number of code occurrences to grade. Grading only a portion of your image is also recommended because it achieves a fast and robust McodeGrade() operation if your image contains other information besides the code occurrences (for example, text). Note that, if your image has an ROI, you can have the nominal angle set to the same angle as that of the image's ROI, using McodeControl() with M_SEARCH_ANGLE set to M_ACCORDING_TO_REGION. You should note that if the code occurrence cannot be decoded by MIL, all grades will be returned as F. If you cannot read a bar code with a cell size that is size 2 or smaller, you can enlarge the image using MimResize() and try again. Parameters Parameters ContextCodeId Specifies the identifier of the code context, allocated using McodeAlloc(). ImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the image buffer containing the code occurrence(s) to be graded. The image buffer must be an 8-bit, unsigned, 1-band image buffer. Note that, this image buffer should contain the same image used for the previous McodeRead() operation. This image buffer can have a rectangular region of interest (ROI), defined using MbufSetRegion() (with or without rotation). In addition, the region must be defined in vector format from a 2D graphics list (M_VECTOR or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error will be generated if the ROI is only in raster format (M_RASTER) or is non-rectangular in shape. SrcResultCodeId Specifies a source code result buffer from which to retrieve McodeRead() results. The result buffer must have been allocated using McodeAllocResult() with M_CODE_READ_RESULT. Note that M_GRADING_STANDARD and M_EXTENDED_AREA_REFLECTANCE_CHECK should have been set before the McodeRead() operation. In addition for all code types except 2D matrix, the results must have been obtained from the same source image in high accuracy (McodeControl() M_POSITION_ACCURACY set to M_HIGH). This parameter can be set to M_NULL. SrcModelCodeIndexOrResultIndex Specifies the index of the code model (in the code context) or the result occurrence (in the source code result buffer) to use when grading. The index of the code model is determined by the order in which it was added to the code context. For specifying the model or the result containing information about the code occurrence to grade Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_ALL. M_ALL Specifies to grade all occurrences of all code models in the code context or all occurrences of code models in the source code result buffer. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies which code model (from the code context) or result index (from the result buffer) to use, when grading the code occurrence. DstResultCodeId Specifies the result buffer in which to write the resulting grading information. The result buffer must have been allocated using McodeAllocResult() with M_CODE_GRADE_RESULT. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion. This parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; milcode.lib. DLL Requires mil.dll; milcode.dll.

Syntax MIL_ID McodeModel( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextCodeId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Operation, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;CodeType, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;Instance, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*ModelCodeIdPtr //in-out ) Description This function adds a code model to a code context, finds a code model of a particular type in a code context, or deletes a code model from a code context. Specify the code type of the code model when adding the model. A code context can contain multiple code models of 1D code types (excluding M_GS1_DATABAR, M_PLANET, M_POSTNET, and M_4_STATE); for other code types, a code context can contain at most one code model. Although a code context can contain only one 2D code model, you can specify to perform a read, grade, or train operation on more than one occurrence of a M_DATAMATRIX or M_DOTCODE code model (or any 1D code model that is not a M_GS1_DATABAR, M_PLANET, M_POSTNET, and M_4_STATE code model), using McodeControl() with M_NUMBER. Instead of individually adding models and specifying their code type, you can automatically detect the code type and encoding scheme of most 1D code occurrences in an image using McodeDetect(), and automatically add a code model for each type found. To do so, set the Operation parameter to M_RESET_FROM_DETECTED_RESULTS, and pass the code detect result buffer to the ControlFlag parameter. This first deletes all existing code models in the code context, and then adds a code model for each detected code type. If two code occurrences with the same code type but different encoding schemes are detected, only one code model of this type is added and its encoding scheme is set to M_ANY (if supported by the code type). Use McodeControl() and McodeInquire() to configure or retrieve information about a code model or code context. When you add a code model, it is assigned a code model identifier. To control or inquire about the code model, or to use the code model to write a symbol, you need its code model identifier. To retrieve the identifier of an existing code model in a code context (for example, in a restored code context), you can perform an M_FIND operation in one of two ways. If you know the code type, you can specify this and the instance of the code model of this type in the code context. Alternatively, you can pass M_ANY as the code type and specify the index of the code model in the code context. Aside from being associated with a code model identifier, a code model is given a sequential index number within the code context, in the order that the code model was added and starting from 0. If a code model is deleted, all code models with higher indices are shifted down one. The added code models cannot be individually freed using McodeFree(). They are either automatically freed when their context is freed, or when they are removed from the context by calling McodeModel() with M_DELETE. Parameters Parameters ContextCodeId Specifies the code context in which to add, find, or delete the code model. The code context must have been previously allocated on the required system using McodeAlloc(). Operation Specifies the operation to perform within the specified code context. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For specifying the type of operation to perform Value Description M_ADD Adds a new code model to the code context. Specify the code type of the code model using the CodeType parameter. M_ADD_IF_NOT_THERE Adds a new code model to the code context if its type is not already present in the context. Specify the type of the code model using the CodeType parameter. In case a code model of the same type is already present, its MIL identifier is returned. M_DELETE Deletes a code model within the code context, whose model identifier is specified by the ContextCodeId parameter. For a M_DELETE operation, the CodeType and Instance parameters must be passed M_NULL. M_DELETE_ALL Deletes all code models from the context. For this operation, the CodeType and Instance parameters must be passed M_NULL. M_FIND Finds a code model within the code context, whose code type is specified by the CodeType parameter. If there are many code models having the same specified code type, you must specify which instance of the specified type using the Instance parameter. M_RESET_FROM_DETECTED_RESULTS Resets the code context and adds new code models to the context based on the results of an McodeDetect() operation. A code model is added for each code type that was detected by the McodeDetect() operation; if it detected two code occurrences with the same code type but different encoding schemes, only one code model of this type is added and its encoding scheme is set to M_ANY (if supported by the code type). All existing code models in the context are deleted. When resetting the code context, M_INITIALIZATION_MODE is set to M_IMPROVED_RECOGNITION. For all code models added, M_POSITION_ACCURACY is set to M_HIGH, and M_CODE_SEARCH_MODE is set to M_BEST. You must pass the code detect result buffer to the ControlFlag parameter. Combination value for M_ADD. You can add the following value to the above-mentioned value to determine whether a code type can be added to the code context, given the code type of the code models that already exist in the context. For inquiring whether a code type can be added to the code context Combination value Description M_SUPPORTED Inquires whether the code type can be added to the code context, given the code type(s) that already exists in the context. CodeType Specifies the code type of the code model to add or find in the code context. Note that if the Operation parameter is set to M_RESET_FROM_DETECTED_RESULTS or M_DELETE, set this parameter to M_NULL. Possible values for CodeType are listed below.

Syntax void McodeRead( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextCodeId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;ImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;ResultCodeId //in ) Description This function searches for code occurrences in an image, as specified in the code context, and writes the results in the specified result buffer. The code context's control settings determine how to perform the operation. Retrieve results using McodeGetResult(). Since the global context settings are required, McodeRead() requires that you pass a code context identifier, and not a code model identifier. The code context passed to McodeRead() can contain multiple code models depending on their code type (see McodeModel() for details). McodeRead() can read one or more occurrences of 1D and Data Matrix code models; for other types of code models, McodeRead() can read at most one occurrence. It is strongly recommended to use a region of interest (ROI), set using MbufSetRegion(), with read operations, especially if your image contains more code occurrences than your context is configured to read; otherwise, MIL will randomly select which code occurrences to read, up to the specified number, from among all the code occurrences in the image. Reading only a portion of your source image is also recommended because it achieves a fast and robust read operation if your image contains other information besides the code occurrences. Note that, if your target image has an ROI, you can have the nominal angle set to the same angle of the target image's ROI, using McodeControl() with M_SEARCH_ANGLE set to M_ACCORDING_TO_REGION. If you have associated the target image with a camera calibration context, you can specify that certain input settings be interpreted in world units. To do so, use McodeControl() with M_SCANLINE_INPUT_UNITS, M_DOT_SPACING_INPUT_UNITS, M_FINDER_PATTERN_INPUT_UNITS, M_SEARCH_ANGLE_INPUT_UNITS, and/or M_CELL_SIZE_INPUT_UNITS set to M_WORLD. Note that if you set any of these constants to M_WORLD but you don't pass McodeRead() a calibrated target image, the function will generate an error. Before performing a read operation, certain control types might have to be set globally for the entire code context or individually for each code model in McodeControl(). When reading multiple occurrences of a Data Matrix code model, setting one or more of these values and reducing the search speed (using McodeControl() with M_SPEED) will produce more robust results. Control type Notes M_CELL_NUMBER_X, M_CELL_NUMBER_Y For 2D code types only, improves the robustness of the operation. M_CELL_SIZE_MIN, M_CELL_SIZE_MAX To improve the robustness of the read operation for some code types, especially Data Matrix and Maxicode. Note that MIL might have difficulty reading code occurrences if the cell size is less than 2 pixels, even if the size is specified. M_ENCODING For code types where M_ANY is not supported. M_ERROR_CORRECTION For code types where M_ANY is not supported. M_FOREGROUND_VALUE This control type is essential for all code types, and the image will not be decoded if the foreground value is not correctly set. M_SEARCH_ANGLE, M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_NEG, M_SEARCH_ANGLE_DELTA_POS If the code occurrences to read are not within 5° of the horizontal axis, and/or if the code occurrences have bearer bars. M_STRING_SIZE_MIN and M_STRING_SIZE_MAX For the M_BC412 code type, the string size must be specified. M_SUB_TYPE For M_COMPOSITECODE and M_GS1_DATABAR code type, specifying the code sub-type can help increase the speed of read operations. Note that if the image contains Structured Append sequence of separate but logically linked ECC 200 code occurrences, MIL will treat the code occurrences as separate, independent code occurrences. Parameters Parameters ContextCodeId Specifies the identifier of the code context. ImageBufId Specifies the 8-bit unsigned 1-band image buffer in which to search. This image buffer can only have a rectangular region of interest (ROI) defined using MbufSetRegion() (with or without rotation). In addition, the region must be defined in vector format from a 2D graphics list (M_VECTOR or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error will be generated if the ROI is only in raster format (M_RASTER) or a non-rectangular shape. ResultCodeId Specifies the result buffer in which to write the results of the read. The result buffer must have been allocated using McodeAllocResult() with M_CODE_READ_RESULT. Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; milcode.lib.

Syntax MIL_ID McodeRestore( MIL_CONST_TEXT_PTR&nbsp;FileName, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*ContextCodeIdPtr //out ) Description This function restores a code context that has been saved to a file, using McodeSave() or McodeStream(). This function can also restore a code context from a predefined code context file distributed with MIL (such as, C:\\Program Files\\Matrox Imaging\\contexts\\SEMI_T1-95r303.mco). For more information, refer to the Predefined SEMI code contexts subsection of the Supported code types section of Chapter 17: Codes. This function restores all of the code context's controls and models that were in effect when the code context was saved. When the code context is no longer required, release it using McodeFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during allocation; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the code context's lifetime and you must not manually free it. Parameters Parameters FileName Specifies the path and name of the file from which to restore the code context (for example, \"C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). The function handles (internally) the opening and closing of the file. The predefined code context files, distributed with MIL, are in the \"C:\\Program Files\\Matrox Imaging\\contexts\\\" folder. To retrieve the file from the remote computer (under Distributed MIL), prefix the specified file name string with \"remote:///\" (for example, \"remote:///C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). This parameter can be set to one of the following: For specifying the file name and path Value Description M_INTERACTIVE [This is only applicable to Windows] Opens the File Open dialog box from which you can interactively specify the drive, directory, and name of the file. MIL_TEXT(\"Filename.mco\") 1 Specifies to restore a user-defined code context.

USA: SEMI, 2003. 10.\". MIL_TEXT(\"SEMI_T2-0298E.mco\") 1 Specifies to restore a predefined Data Matrix 2D code context with an ECC_200 encoding scheme that matches the \"SEMI SEMI T2-0298 (reapproved 1104) specification for marking of wavers with a two-dimensional matrix code symbol . USA: SEMI, 2004. 9.\". MIL_TEXT(\"SEMI_T7-0303.mco\") 1 Specifies to restore a predefined Data Matrix 2D code context that matches the \"SEMI SEMI T7-0303 specification for back surface marking of double-side polished wafers with a two-dimensional matrix code symbol . USA: SEMI, 2003. 4.\". 1 If you are passing the value in a variable, don't enclose it in MIL_TEXT(). SysId Specifies the system on which to allocate the context. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the system Value Description M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion. This parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. ContextCodeIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the code context identifier or specifies the data type that the function should use to return the code context identifier. For retrieving the identifier or specifying how to return it Value Description M_NULL Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated code context ; in this case, a standard MIL identifier of type MIL_ID is returned. M_UNIQUE_ID Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated code context ; in this case, a MIL smart identifier of type MIL_UNIQUE_CODE_ID is returned instead of a standard MIL identifier. This setting is only available when using C++11 (or later). A MIL smart identifier manages the lifespan of the MIL object it owns (similar to a std::unique_ptr). Note, you can use a MIL smart identifier as though it were a standard MIL identifier, except that you cannot use it to manually free the code context (it is freed automatically). For more information, see the MIL smart identifiers subsection of the MIL custom data types, void pointers, extensions, and portability functions section of Chapter 2: Building an application. Address in which to write the identifier Specifies the address of a MIL_ID in which to write the identifier of the restored code context. If allocation fails, M_NULL is written as the identifier. Return value The returned value is the code context identifier either as a standard identifier (MIL_ID) or a smart identifier (MIL_UNIQUE_CODE_ID).

This function can also save a grading report to a file or save a training report to a file. To inquire the number of bytes necessary to save a code context to memory stream, you should first call this function (McodeStream()) with M_INQUIRE_SIZE_BYTE. The content saved to memory stream is equivalent to the content saved to file. In addition, any file saved using this function is equivalent to a file saved with McodeSave(). You can use this and other MIL stream functions, for example, to save all required MIL objects, as well as any other custom data, for your application to a memory stream. Once in a memory stream, you can write the stream to a single file or transfer it over a network. You are responsible for concatenating the streams and for saving the stream to file. Using McodeStream(), you can choose to save a backwards-compatible version of the code context, which will work using a specified version of MIL that is up to one major release older than the current version. For example, if you allocate a code context using MIL 10.0 and save it to version 9.0, you can restore this context on a computer where MIL 9.0 is installed. However, all settings and features unique to the higher version will be ignored when restored using the lower version. Besides saving backwards-compatible versions, you can also load or restore a code context saved using MIL version 7.0 or above. Settings that do not exist in the lower version will be filled with default values when the code context is loaded or restored using the current version. Parameters Parameters MemPtrOrFileName Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): MIL_TEXT_PTR [optionally, in C++: a reference to a MIL_STRING] Optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector of type MIL_UINT8 Specifies the file or memory stream.

MIL_TEXT(\"FileName\") 1 Specifies the drive, directory, and name of the file (for example, \"C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"), when the StreamType parameter is set to M_FILE. The function handles (internally) the opening and closing of the file. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. To specify a file on a remote computer (under Distributed MIL), prefix the specified file name string with \"remote:///\" (for example, \"remote:///C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). SysId This parameter must be set to M_NULL. Version This parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. ContextOrResultCodeIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable containing the identifier of the result buffer to save. The result buffer must have been allocated using McodeAllocResult() with M_CODE_GRADE_RESULT or M_CODE_TRAIN_RESULT, and it must contain the result of a successful McodeGrade() or McodeTrain() operation, respectively. If the operation is not successful, M_NULL is returned. 1 If you are passing the value in a variable, don't enclose it in MIL_TEXT(). Compilation information Header Include mil.h.

      "text": " McodeTrain Synopsis Train the control type settings of a code context and its code models so that they are optimized for the specified set of sample images. Syntax void McodeTrain( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextCodeId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;NumImages, //in const MIL_ID&nbsp;*ImageArrayPtr, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;TrainResultCodeId //in ) Description This function trains the settings of the selected control types of a code context and its code models so that the settings are optimized for performing an McodeRead() or McodeGrade() operation on the specified set of sample images. The function saves the results in the specified code train result buffer; the specified code context is not directly modified. Activate the required control types for training using McodeControl() with the combination constant M_TRAIN or with M_SET_TRAINING_STATE_ALL. The following control types are supported for training: M_CELL_NUMBER_.... M_CELL_SIZE_.... M_CODE_FLIP. M_DATAMATRIX_SHAPE. M_DECODE_ALGORITHM. M_DOT_SIZE_.... M_DOT_SPACING_.... M_ENCODING. M_ERROR_CORRECTION. M_FOREGROUND_VALUE. M_MINIMUM_CONTRAST. M_NUMBER. M_SEARCH_ANGLE.... M_SPEED. M_THRESHOLD_.... M_USE_PRESEARCH. You can limit the code occurrences used for training to those within specific regions of the training images. If the training images have a rectangular region of interest (ROI), defined using MbufSetRegion(), McodeTrain() only uses occurrences within those regions to establish the recommended settings. The regions must be defined in vector format from a 2D graphics list (M_VECTOR or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error will be generated if any of the images have an ROI that is only in raster format (M_RASTER) or is a non-rectangular shape. This function writes the recommended settings of the activated control types to the specified code train result buffer. You can reconfigure any code context with these results using McodeControl() with M_RESET_FROM_TRAINED_RESULTS. This control type discards any existing code models from the context, and then adds the code models used for training to the context. If a control type was not trained, it is set to its value used during training; if a control type was trained, it is set to its trained value. Prior to using M_RESET_FROM_TRAINED_RESULTS, you should ensure that the train operation was successful using McodeGetResult() with M_STATUS. If required, you can retrieve the recommended setting for a specific control type using McodeGetResult(). This is especially useful if you want to reconfigure the code context that was used during training. In this case, you can use the retrieved values to selectively change the control types of the context to their trained value. Note that some control types are inter-dependent; changing the setting of one control type to its trained value might not be optimal if the settings of other control types are not also changed. This is especially true for control types that are automatically activated for training if another control type is activated (for example, M_CELL_NUMBER_...). You can retrieve or draw the results of the read operation that McodeTrain() internally performed on each training image. You can use this extra information to complement the status result. First, call McodeGetResult() with M_CODE_RESULT_ID. This returns the identifiers of the internal code read result buffers; there is one per training image. You can then pass one of these result buffer identifiers to McodeGetResult(), and retrieve any type of result available for an McodeRead() operation. You can also pass one of the result buffer identifiers to McodeDraw() to visualize the results for a specific training image. The recommended control type settings for a code context and its code models are based on the code occurrences found in all the training images. McodeTrain() must find at least one occurrence of one of the code models among all the sample images; otherwise, McodeGetResult() with M_STATUS returns M_STATUS_TRAIN_FAILED. You can retrieve the buffer identifiers of images in which no code occurrence was found using M_FAILED_IMAGES_ID. Parameters Parameters ContextCodeId Specifies the identifier of the code context to train. NumImages Specifies the number of training images passed to ImageArrayPtr. When using a standard vector (std::vector) overload function in C++, you can pass M_DEFAULT to this parameter and MIL will automatically determine the size based on the number of items in the vector passed to the ImageArrayPtr parameter. For specifying the number of training images Value Description Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the number of images passed to ImageArrayPtr. ImageArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_ID [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_ID&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumImages) Specifies the address of the array containing the buffer identifiers of the training images. The image buffers must be 1-band, 8-bit unsigned buffers. Any of the image buffers can have a rectangular region of interest (ROI) defined using MbufSetRegion() (with or without rotation). The region must be defined in vector format from a 2D graphics list (M_VECTOR or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error will be generated if the ROI is only in raster format (M_RASTER) or a non-rectangular shape. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion. This parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. TrainResultCodeId Specifies the train result buffer identifier. The result buffer must have been allocated using McodeAllocResult() with M_CODE_TRAIN_RESULT.

      "text": " McodeWrite Synopsis Encode an ASCII string into a symbol. Syntax void McodeWrite( MIL_ID&nbsp;ModelCodeId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;ImageBufId, //in MIL_CONST_TEXT_PTR&nbsp;StringPtr, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;WriteResultCodeId //in ) Description This function encodes a null-terminated ASCII string into a symbol (code) using the code type and encoding scheme, specified by the code model, and draws the code into a specified image. For a given code model and string, you can inquire the minimum buffer size required to draw the code, using McodeWrite() with its ImageBufId parameter set to M_NULL, and then using McodeGetResult() with M_WRITE_SIZE_X and M_WRITE_SIZE_Y. The control type settings of the specified code model determine how to perform the operation. Before performing a McodeWrite() operation, you must set certain controls using McodeControl() or verify that their default settings are appropriate, specifically: Control Notes M_CELL_NUMBER_X, M_CELL_NUMBER_Y Specifies the number of cells in the X and Y directions. Improves the robustness of the operation, for 2D code types only. If these settings are set to M_DEFAULT, then the number of cells will be selected automatically so as to minimize the size of the resulting code. M_CELL_SIZE_MODE Specifies how to establish the cell size. M_CELL_SIZE_VALUE Specifies the cell size to use when M_CELL_SIZE_MODE is set to M_USER_DEFINED. M_DOT_SHAPE Specifies the shape of the dots used to draw foreground cells. This control type can be set for M_AZTEC, M_DATAMATRIX, M_QRCODE, and M_MICROQRCODE code types. M_DOT_SIZE Specifies the size of the dot (or square) used to draw foreground cells. This control type can be set for M_AZTEC, M_DATAMATRIX, M_MAXICODE, M_QRCODE, and M_MICROQRCODE code types. M_ENCODING Specifies the encoding scheme. This control type must be set for code types where M_ANY is not supported as the encoding scheme. M_ERROR_CORRECTION Specifies the type of error correction. This control type must be set for code types where M_ANY is not a supported error correction type. M_FOREGROUND_VALUE Specifies the foreground color of the code. This control type is essential for all code types. If you have associated the target image with a camera calibration context, you can specify that certain input settings be interpreted in world units. To do so, use McodeControl() with M_CELL_SIZE_INPUT_UNITS set to M_WORLD. Note that if you set this constant to M_WORLD but you don't pass McodeWrite() a calibrated target image, the function will generate an error. Parameters Parameters ModelCodeId Specifies the identifier of the code model. ImageBufId Specifies the 8-bit unsigned 1-band image buffer in which to write the symbol. Set this parameter to one of the following. For specifying the image buffer Value Description M_NULL Allows you to inquire about the minimum buffer size required. Using this value means that McodeWrite() will not write into an image buffer. After calling McodeWrite() with M_NULL, call McodeGetResult() to retrieve the minimum width (M_WRITE_SIZE_X) and height (M_WRITE_SIZE_Y) required for the image buffer. MIL image buffer identifier Specifies that McodeWrite() will write into the image buffer, and in which image buffer to write. This buffer must be 8-bit unsigned. In addition, it should be large enough to hold the symbol. StringPtr Specifies the address of the string to be encoded. For specifying the string of the code Value Description M_NULL Specifies that a sample string will be encoded. This can be used if you need to test or use the functionality of McodeWrite() without needing to encode a specific string (for example, to draw the code type on a button in an interface). The sample string that is encoded depends on the control values set by McodeControl(). MIL_TEXT(\"String\") 1 Specifies the address of the string. You need to know the string specifications of the code to write. Note the following restrictions for certain code types: If the code type is a Codabar code, the string must be numeric, but can contain the following ASCII characters: minus (-), dollar sign ($), colon (:), forward slash (/), period (.), and plus (+). In addition, the string must start and end with any of the following characters: a, b, c, or d. If the code type is an Interleaved 2 of 5 code, the string must have an even number of characters. If the code type is a Maxicode code, with M_ENCODING set to M_ENC_MODE2 or M_ENC_MODE3, the string must respect the structured carrier message format (the portion of the string that contains postal code, country code, and class of service information). If the code type is a composite code, the string must be passed in the following format: 1D string|2D string, where | is used as the separator. If the code type uses an M_ENC_MODE2 or M_ENC_MODE3 encoding scheme, the string is truncated so that only the string that can fit in a single code is written. MIL does not support a Structured Append sequence of separate but logically linked ECC 200 codes. If the code type is a composite code, the FNC1 separator is represented by the unprintable character with ASCII value 29. In addition, add parentheses around the application identifiers in your string. Note that this is required by the McodeWrite() operation; the parentheses are not actually coded. 1 If you are passing the value in a variable, don't enclose it in MIL_TEXT(). ControlFlag Specifies the function's control flag. This parameter can be set to one or more of the following value: (for example, M_ESCAPE_SEQUENCE + M_GS1_FORMAT). For specifying the function's control flag Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the string to encode does not use ASCII character codes for unprintable characters. Unprintable characters are not encoded. In addition, the string is not written in GS1 format. This value cannot be combined with any other value. M_ESCAPE_SEQUENCE Specifies that the string to encode uses ASCII character codes for unprintable characters. You must use a code type that supports unprintable characters specified using ASCII codes. When typing the string to encode, the unprintable character's ASCII character code must be in hexadecimal format, preceded by \\x (for example, \\x0D for ASCII 13, which is the carriage return). Note that if you want to encode the \"\\\" character in escape sequence mode, type \"\\\\\". M_GS1_FORMAT Specifies that the string should be written as a GS1 code. This value is only available when dealing with M_AZTEC, M_DATAMATRIX, M_CODE128, M_EAN14, M_GS1_128, and M_QRCODE code types. WriteResultCodeId Specifies the identifier of the code write result buffer. The result buffer must have been allocated using McodeAllocResult() with M_CODE_WRITE_RESULT. Remark The prototype of this function changed as of MIL 10 PP4. For C applications, by default the original prototype is used to ensure backward-compatibility. To use the updated prototype, add #define M_USE_OLD_MCODE_API_IN_C 0 before including mil.h. For information about the original prototype refer to the MIL 10 PP3 documentation, available online to registered users at https://www.matrox.com/imaging/mil_help.

      "text": " MgraAlloc Synopsis Allocate a 2D graphics context. Syntax MIL_ID MgraAlloc( MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*ContextGraIdPtr //out ) Description This function allocates a 2D graphics context on the specified system. A 2D graphics context is required to use MIL graphics to perform annotations. Whenever an annotation is done, 2D graphics context settings are inherited by the graphics. Different contexts can coexist; use their identifier to specify which to use or change. To modify or inquire 2D graphics context settings, use MgraControl() and MgraInquire(). Note that, upon allocation of an application, a default 2D graphics context is automatically allocated. Rather than using MgraAlloc() to allocate a 2D graphics context, you can use this default 2D graphics context, by specifying M_DEFAULT wherever a 2D graphics context identifier is required. Note that there is a different default 2D graphics context for each thread. When the 2D graphics context is no longer required, release it using MgraFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during allocation; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the 2D graphics context's lifetime and you must not manually free it. Parameters Parameters SysId Specifies the system on which to allocate the 2D graphics context. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the system Value Description M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). ContextGraIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the 2D graphics context identifier or specifies the data type that the function should use to return the 2D graphics context identifier. For retrieving the identifier or specifying how to return it Value Description M_NULL Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated 2D graphics context ; in this case, a standard MIL identifier of type MIL_ID is returned. M_UNIQUE_ID Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated 2D graphics context ; in this case, a MIL smart identifier of type MIL_UNIQUE_GRA_ID is returned instead of a standard MIL identifier. This setting is only available when using C++11 (or later). A MIL smart identifier manages the lifespan of the MIL object it owns (similar to a std::unique_ptr). Note, you can use a MIL smart identifier as though it were a standard MIL identifier, except that you cannot use it to manually free the 2D graphics context (it is freed automatically). For more information, see the MIL smart identifiers subsection of the MIL custom data types, void pointers, extensions, and portability functions section of Chapter 2: Building an application. Address in which to write the identifier Specifies the address of a MIL_ID in which to write the identifier of the allocated 2D graphics context. If allocation fails, M_NULL is written as the identifier. Return value The returned value is the 2D graphics context identifier either as a standard identifier (MIL_ID) or a smart identifier (MIL_UNIQUE_GRA_ID).

Syntax MIL_ID MgraAllocList( MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ListGraType, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*ListGraIdPtr //out ) Description This function allocates a 2D graphics list, which holds graphics in vector (mathematical) form. Different 2D graphics lists can coexist; use their identifier to specify which to use or change. The 2D graphics list can be used to annotate the display non-destructively, using MdispControl() with M_ASSOCIATED_GRAPHIC_LIST_ID. Since graphics in a 2D graphics list are vector-based, you can zoom the display without the pixelation (loss of clarity) of the graphics. Also, if you add, modify, or delete graphics, the display can be immediately updated to reflect the changes. To set whether the display is automatically updated, use MdispControl() with M_UPDATE_GRAPHIC_LIST. The 2D graphics list can also be used to draw destructively in an image, using MgraDraw(). Once drawn, the graphics are raster-based and are part of the image buffer; they cannot be modified. Also, if this annotated image is displayed, zooming it will cause pixelation (loss of clarity) of the graphics and changes in line thickness. Using MgraDraw() is similar to using a graphics function (for example, MgraArc()) to draw destructively in an image. Graphics can be added to the list using any of the Mgra...() graphics functions, such as MgraArc(). To remove all graphics from the list, use MgraClear(). You can also use MgraControlList() with M_DELETE to remove graphics (one or all) from the list. When you add graphics to the list, they inherit the current settings of the specified 2D graphics context (as described in MgraAlloc()); however, there is no link between the 2D graphics list and the 2D graphics context. Graphics already in the list are not affected by changes made to the context. To modify or inquire 2D graphics list settings, use MgraControlList() and MgraInquireList(). When the 2D graphics list is no longer required, release it using MgraFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during allocation; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the 2D graphics list's lifetime and you must not manually free it. Parameters Parameters SysId Specifies the system on which to allocate the 2D graphics list. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the system Value Description M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). ListGraType Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. ListGraIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the 2D graphics list identifier or specifies the data type that the function should use to return the 2D graphics list identifier. For retrieving the identifier or specifying how to return it Value Description M_NULL Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated 2D graphics list ; in this case, a standard MIL identifier of type MIL_ID is returned. M_UNIQUE_ID Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated 2D graphics list ; in this case, a MIL smart identifier of type MIL_UNIQUE_GRA_ID is returned instead of a standard MIL identifier.

Syntax void MgraArc( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextGraId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufOrListGraId, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;XCenter, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;YCenter, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;XRad, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;YRad, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;StartAngle, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;EndAngle //in ) Description This function draws an arc destructively (raster-based) in the specified image. Alternatively, this function can add a vector-based version of an arc to the specified 2D graphics list, allowing you to, for example, non-destructively annotate a display without pixelation effects upon scaling. The arc is based on an ellipse centered at XCenter and YCenter, with radii XRad and YRad. The arc is the part of the ellipse between the start angle (StartAngle) and the end angle (EndAngle), both measured with respect to the X-axis. The arc inherits all the relevant settings of the specified 2D graphics context, such as the foreground color (MgraControl() with M_COLOR). If part of the arc falls outside of the specified area (image or display), that part is clipped off. The following image shows how the parameters are used to define an arc: An arc's center position, radii, and angle values are interpreted with respect to the input coordinate system, specified using MgraControl() or MgraControlList() with M_INPUT_UNITS. An angle interpreted with respect to the pixel coordinate system is always measured counter-clockwise. For information on the angle's direction of rotation when interpreting the angle with respect to the relative coordinate system, see the Angle convention in MIL subsection of the Working with real-world units section of Chapter 28: Calibrating your camera setup. Note that if you set your input coordinate system to M_WORLD and you pass MgraArc() an uncalibrated image or the drawing target of the 2D graphics list is uncalibrated, the function will generate an error. To modify or inquire 2D graphics context settings, use MgraControl() or MgraInquire(). To modify or inquire 2D graphics list settings, use MgraControlList() or MgraInquireList(). To create a filled arc, use MgraArcFill(). To create an arc that can be optionally filled and rotated, use MgraArcAngle(). Unlike most other functions that modify a MIL object, you can call this function concurrently from multiple threads on the same MIL 2D graphics list (DstImageBufOrListGraId) without using an M_MUTEX object, as long as all the other parameters of the concurrent calls do not also share data. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler) in 64-bit mode, MgraArc() internally calls the MIL_DOUBLE version of this function (MgraArcDouble()). If you need to pass large integer values (including pointers), call the MIL_INT64 version of this function (MgraArcInt64()). Parameters Parameters ContextGraId Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics context.

Alternatively, this function can add a vector-based version of an arc or sector to the specified 2D graphics list, allowing you to, for example, non-destructively annotate a display without pixelation effects upon scaling. The arc or sector graphic is based on an ellipse centered at XCenter and YCenter, with radii XRad and YRad. The arc is the curve of the ellipse between the start angle (StartAngle) and the end angle (EndAngle), with an orientation along the X-axis (XAxisAngle).

However, you can choose to draw it filled with the specified foreground color by specifying the M_FILLED combination constant. To modify or inquire 2D graphics context settings, use MgraControl() or MgraInquire(). To modify or inquire 2D graphics list settings, use MgraControlList() or MgraInquireList(). To create a filled arc (sector) that is not rotated, you can also use MgraArcFill(). To create an arc that is not rotated or filled, you can also use MgraArc().

M_COLOR_LIGHT_WHITE Specifies the color light white. M_COLOR_MAGENTA Specifies the color magenta. M_COLOR_RED Specifies the color red. M_COLOR_WHITE Specifies the color white. M_COLOR_YELLOW Specifies the color yellow. Value Specifies a grayscale value. The buffer can be a 1-band or multi-band buffer. The specified value is cast to the buffer type and depth. The default value is -1. For example, this value is equivalent to 0xFF for an 8-bit buffer. Note that a grayscale value can be any integer or floating-point number. If the given value exceeds the range of the possible values that can be stored in each band of the destination buffer, the least significant bits of the value are used. M_DRAW_DIRECTION Sets how to draw (render) an arrow pointing in the direction with which a graphic was defined. This only affects graphics that are not filled, and that have such a direction as part of their definition; for example, arc, ellipse, line, rectangle, and ring. MIL ignores this setting for other graphics. This setting does not affect drawings created using a processing or analysis module draw function (M...Draw()). For more information about how the directions are drawn for different graphics, see the Drawing graphics in a calibrated image subsection of the Drawing graphics section of Chapter 26: Generating graphics. M_DEFAULT Same as M_NONE. M_NONE Specifies that no direction is drawn. M_PRIMARY_DIRECTION Specifies to draw an arrow showing the primary direction of the graphic. For example, if you draw the primary direction for a rectangle defined with MgraRectAngle(), the arrow will point in the angular direction set with the Angle parameter. M_PRIMARY_DIRECTION + M_SECONDARY_DIRECTION Specifies to draw an arrow showing both the primary and secondary direction of the graphic. M_SECONDARY_DIRECTION Specifies to draw an arrow showing the secondary direction of the graphic. For example, a rectangle's secondary direction is equal to its PrimaryDirection - 90°. M_DRAW_OFFSET_X Sets the offset to subtract from the source X-coordinates before rendering the graphic. This is useful to take results obtained relative to an offset and draw them relative to the top-left corner of the destination image of a draw operation. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0 pixels. Value Specifies the X-coordinate offset to subtract, in pixels. M_DRAW_OFFSET_Y Sets the offset to subtract from the source Y-coordinates before rendering the graphic. This is useful to take results obtained relative to an offset and draw them relative to the top-left corner of the destination image of a draw operation. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0 pixels. Value Specifies the Y-coordinate offset to subtract, in pixels. M_DRAW_ZOOM_X Sets the scale factor in the X-direction. This value is useful to zoom drawings of results. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the scale factor in the X-direction. M_DRAW_ZOOM_Y Sets the scale factor in the Y-direction. This value is useful to zoom drawings of results. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the scale factor in the Y-direction. M_FIXTURE Sets which camera calibration information to use when rendering (drawing or displaying) a graphic that has been defined in world units (M_INPUT_UNITS set to M_WORLD). MIL can interpret positioning and dimensioning information of the graphic solely using the camera calibration information associated with the destination image buffer (or the image buffer selected to the display). Alternatively, you can have MIL use the explicitly specified camera calibration information (M_GRAPHIC_SOURCE_CALIBRATION). If only the destination of the graphic is associated with camera calibration information, it will be used to render the graphic. However, if both are available, you should use M_FIXTURE to identify with respect to which of their relative coordinate systems has positioning and dimensioning information been specified. If with respect to that of the destination camera calibration information (M_USE_DESTINATION_FIRST), the source camera calibration information is not used. If with respect to that of the source camera calibration information (M_USE_SOURCE_FIRST), positions and dimensions are transformed from this relative coordinate system to the absolute coordinate system; then, since it is assumed that there is only one absolute coordinate system, these positions and dimensions are transformed from the absolute coordinate system to the pixel coordinate system, using the destination camera calibration information. M_USE_DESTINATION_FIRST Specifies that the camera calibration information of the destination is used when rendering the graphic. In this case, the graphic follows the relative coordinate system of the destination. This is most often used when working with ROIs. This is the default value. M_USE_SOURCE_FIRST Specifies that the camera calibration information of the graphic, set with M_GRAPHIC_SOURCE_CALIBRATION, is used when rendering the graphic. In this case, the graphic is positioned independent of the destination's relative coordinate system; the destination camera calibration information is only used, if available, for the world to pixel mapping. M_GRAPHIC_CONVERSION_MODE Sets how the shape of a graphic, defined in world units, is converted to pixels (rendered). Drawings created using a processing or analysis module draw function (M...Draw()) ignore this control type; instead the graphics are drawn using settings defined in their respective modules. M_PRESERVE_SHAPE_AVERAGE Specifies to render the graphic so that its shape is preserved, even if it means not respecting the camera calibration information exactly. For example, a rectangle in world units will be mapped to a rectangle in pixel units, even if the accurate conversion would not yield a rectangle. This setting applies only to dots (MgraDot() and MgraDots()) and to rectangles (MgraRect() and MgraRectAngle()). M_RESHAPE_FOLLOWING_DISTORTION Specifies that all points along the contour of the graphic will be converted using the camera calibration information, following any non-linear distortion. This mode is slower, but more accurate. M_RESHAPE_FROM_POINTS Specifies that only a few key points or features will be converted using the camera calibration information; from these converted points, the rest of the graphic will be rendered respecting the shape of the graphic. For example, when converting a line segment from world to pixel units, the two end points are mapped to pixel units, and then a straight line is drawn connecting these two points, ignoring any non-linear distortion in-between. This is the fastest mode, and is accurate as long as there is only linear distortion. This is the default value. M_GRAPHIC_SOURCE_CALIBRATION Sets the camera calibration information to use to interpret positioning and dimensioning information of a graphic defined in world units (M_INPUT_UNITS set to M_WORLD), if you have set M_FIXTURE to M_USE_SOURCE_FIRST. If the destination also has camera calibration information, positioning and dimensioning information are transformed from the relative coordinate system of the source camera calibration information to its absolute coordinate system. Then, since it is assumed that there is only one absolute coordinate system, the dimensions and positions are transformed from the absolute coordinate system to the pixel coordinate system, using the destination camera calibration information. Note that this camera calibration information is also used if you have set M_FIXTURE to M_USE_DESTINATION_FIRST, but the graphic is drawn in an image buffer that has no camera calibration information. M_NULL Specifies that no source camera calibration information is available to interpret positioning and dimensioning information of a graphic defined in world units, except when the graphic is drawn using the draw function (M...Draw()) of a processing or analysis module; in this case, the camera calibration information of the context or result will be used. This is the default value. MIL Identifier Specifies the identifier of a camera calibration context, image buffer or processing or analysis module result buffer, whose camera calibration information to use; this object is only associated with the 2D graphics context, not copied. If, for example, the relative coordinate system changes after using M_GRAPHIC_SOURCE_CALIBRATION, it will be reflected in the camera calibration information that is used. M_INPUT_UNITS Sets the units with which to interpret the graphic's position and dimensional information. This essentially sets the input coordinate system to use. M_DISPLAY Specifies to interpret the values in pixel units that, unlike M_PIXEL, are not altered when the display is panned or zoomed. This can be useful if, for example, you always want to display the camera's current frame rate at the top-left corner. M_DISPLAY must only be specified when drawing in a 2D graphics list and the 2D graphics list is used to annotate the display non-destructively, using MdispControl() with M_ASSOCIATED_GRAPHIC_LIST_ID. M_PIXEL Specifies to interpret the values in pixel units, with respect to the pixel coordinate system. If you are drawing in a 2D graphics list and the 2D graphics list is used to annotate the display non-destructively (M_ASSOCIATED_GRAPHIC_LIST_ID), the graphic will be zoomed and panned according to the display's zoom and pan settings. This is not the case when setting the units to M_DISPLAY, which also uses pixel units. This is the default value. M_WORLD Specifies to interpret the values in world units, with respect to the relative coordinate system. If you are drawing in a 2D graphics list and the 2D graphics list is used to annotate the display non-destructively (M_ASSOCIATED_GRAPHIC_LIST_ID), the graphic will be zoomed and panned according to the display's zoom and pan settings. When using M_WORLD, a graphic's coordinates are interpreted as real-world values and transformed to pixel values before being drawn or associated with the display non-destructively. Note that using the camera calibration information associated with the image (M_WORLD), ensures that whenever the relative coordinate system moves (for example, with McalRelativeOrigin(), McalSetCoordinateSystem(), or McalFixture()), the non-destructive annotations move accordingly. In this case, the position of the graphics is set according to the position of the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, drawing a graphic or calling MgraFill() generates an error if the operation is performed on an uncalibrated image and M_GRAPHIC_SOURCE_CALIBRATION is set to M_NULL. M_LINE_THICKNESS Sets the thickness of the lines and the diameter of dots, depending on the drawing operation. Note that for this setting, the thickness of the line is not affected by panning or zooming, and is always interpreted in pixel units. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the thickness of the lines and diameter of the dots, in pixels. The value must be an odd integer. The default value is 1 pixel. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to change the 2D graphics context settings that affect the interactivity of a graphic, drawn in a 2D graphics list associated with a display, when interactive mode is enabled (MdispControl() with M_GRAPHIC_LIST_INTERACTIVE set to M_ENABLE). Note, you can still change these settings even if interactive mode is disabled, but they will have no effect until interactive mode is enabled. Adding a graphic that does not support one of the following settings to a 2D graphics list will automatically assign the setting of the graphic to M_DISABLE. For settings that apply to graphics when interactive mode is enabled ControlType Description ControlValue M_EDITABLE Sets whether a graphic can be edited via user interaction in an interactive display. If a graphic is not visible or if it is not selectable, it is not editable and this setting is ignored.

M_ENABLE Specifies that the graphic can be edited via user interaction. This is the default value. M_RESIZABLE Sets whether a graphic can be resized via user interaction in an interactive display. If a graphic is not visible, not selectable, or not editable, it is not resizable and this setting is ignored. This setting applies to all types of graphics except a dot (MgraDot()), dots (MgraDots()), text (MgraText()), sets of finite length lines (MgraLines() with M_LINE_LIST), and drawings created using a processing or analysis module draw function (M...Draw()). M_DISABLE Specifies that the graphic cannot be resized via user interaction and the resize handles will not be displayed if a graphic is selected. Note that the graphic can still be resized using MgraControlList(). M_ENABLE Specifies that the graphic can be resized via user interaction by clicking and dragging one of the resize handles. This is the default value. M_ROTATABLE Sets whether a graphic can be rotated via user interaction in an interactive display. If a graphic is not visible, not selectable, or not editable, it is not rotatable and this setting is ignored. This setting applies to all types of graphics except a dot (MgraDot()), dots (MgraDots()), text (MgraText()), sets of finite length lines (MgraLines() with M_LINE_LIST), and drawings created using a processing or analysis module draw function (M...Draw()). M_DISABLE Specifies that the graphic cannot be rotated via user interaction and the rotate handle will not be displayed if a graphic is selected. Note that the graphic can still be rotated using MgraControlList(). M_ENABLE Specifies that the graphic can be rotated via user interaction by clicking and dragging the rotation handle. This is the default value. M_SELECTABLE Sets whether a graphic can be selected via user interaction in an interactive display. If a graphic is not visible, it is not selectable and this setting is ignored. This setting applies to all graphics except dots (MgraDots()) and sets of finite length lines (MgraLines() with M_LINE_LIST). M_DISABLE Specifies that the graphic cannot be selected via user interaction. Note that the selection can still be changed using MgraControlList(), but it will not be apparent on the display. M_ENABLE Specifies that the graphic can be selected by clicking on it. This is the default value. M_SPECIFIC_FEATURES_EDITABLE Sets whether a graphic can be modified via user interaction in an interactive display using handles that are specific to its graphic type. If a graphic is not visible, not selectable, or not editable, it cannot be modified using its type-specific handles and this setting is ignored. This setting applies to all types of graphics except dots (MgraDots()), text (MgraText()), sets of finite length lines (MgraLines() with M_LINE_LIST), and drawings created using a processing or analysis module draw function (M...Draw()). M_DISABLE Specifies that the graphic cannot be modified via user interaction and its specific feature handles will not be displayed if a graphic is selected. Note that the graphic can still be modified using MgraControlList(). M_ENABLE Specifies that the graphic can be modified via user interaction by clicking and dragging one of the specific feature handles. This is the default value. M_TRANSLATABLE Sets whether a graphic can be moved (translated) via user interaction in an interactive display. If a graphic is not visible, not selectable, or not editable, it is not movable and this setting is ignored. This setting applies to all types of graphics except dots (MgraDots()), text (MgraText()), sets of finite length lines (MgraLines() with M_LINE_LIST), and drawings created using a processing or analysis module draw function (M...Draw()). M_DISABLE Specifies that the graphic cannot be moved via user interaction. Note that the graphic can still be moved using MgraControlList(). M_ENABLE Specifies that the graphic can be moved via user interaction by clicking and dragging the graphic, its selection box, or its center handle. This is the default value. M_VISIBLE Sets whether a graphic is rendered on the display. Note that a graphic that is not visible cannot be affected by any user interaction in an interactive display. This setting applies to all types of graphics. M_FALSE Specifies that the graphic is not rendered. M_TRUE Specifies that the graphic is rendered. This is the default value. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to change 2D graphics context settings that apply only to text (MgraText()). For settings that apply only to text ControlType Description ControlValue M_BACKCOLOR Sets the background color. M_RGB888( MIL_INT Red, MIL_INT Green, MIL_INT Blue ) Specifies an RGB value when using the 2D graphics context to draw in an 8-bit, 3-band buffer.

The default value is 0. Note that a grayscale value can be any integer or floating-point number. If the given value exceeds the range of the possible values that can be stored in each band of the destination buffer, the least significant bits of the value are used. M_BACKGROUND_MODE Sets whether to fill the text's background. M_OPAQUE Specifies that the background will be filled with the current background color before drawing text. This is the default value. M_TRANSPARENT Specifies not to change the background before drawing text. This creates a transparent background for printed characters. M_FONT_AUTO_SELECT Sets whether MIL should search for a suitable font to draw text if the currently selected font (MgraFont()) is a TrueType font that does not support the character code. MIL will first attempt to make its selection from already used fonts, and then from system fonts. M_DISABLE Specifies that MIL will not search for a suitable font. An error is returned if the character code cannot be drawn using the current TrueType font. M_ENABLE Specifies that MIL will search for a suitable font. This is the default value. M_FONT_SIZE Sets the size to draw text when using a TrueType font. When using a bitmap font, use M_FONT_X_SCALE and M_FONT_Y_SCALE to set the font size. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the text's font size, in points. The default value is 12-point font. M_FONT_X_SCALE Sets the font's horizontal scaling factor. This setting only applies to bitmap fonts. For TrueType fonts, use M_FONT_SIZE to set the font size. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the factor by which to multiply the width of the font's characters. Note that using a font with a scale of 1.0 accelerates text drawing. The default value is 1.0. M_FONT_Y_SCALE Sets the font's vertical scaling factor. This setting only applies to bitmap fonts. For TrueType fonts, use M_FONT_SIZE to set the font size. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the factor by which to multiply the height of the font's characters.

Syntax void MgraControlList( MIL_ID&nbsp;GraListId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;LabelOrIndex, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;SubIndex, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlType, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;ControlValue //in ) Description This function allows you to control the settings of graphics contained within the 2D graphics list. Most of the control type settings can be inquired using MgraInquireList(). When graphics are added to the list, they inherit the current settings of the 2D graphics context. However, subsequent changes to the 2D graphics context (for example, with MgraControl()) do not affect graphics already in the list. The settings of graphics in the list can only be modified using MgraControlList(). Using this function, you can also control a sub-element of a graphic in a 2D graphics list. This is useful when a single point of a graphic requires repositioning. For example, you can reposition (M_POSITION_X and M_POSITION_Y) a vertex point of a polygon (MgraLines() with M_POLYGON) by specifying the polygon graphic (LabelOrIndex), and one of its points (SubIndex). All geometric type changes that you make to the graphics (such as, rotation, scaling, and translation) are applied according to the current input units of each graphic in the list, as specified with M_INPUT_UNITS, on a per graphic basis. For example, if you change the position of two graphics in the list, a dot set in pixel units and a rectangle set in world units, the dot's position will change in pixel units and the rectangle's position will change in world units. However, changing M_INPUT_UNITS to a different value will not convert a graphic's position. Unlike most other functions that modify a MIL object, you can call this function concurrently from multiple threads on the same MIL 2D graphics list (GraListId) without using an M_MUTEX object, as long as all the other parameters of the concurrent calls do not also share data. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler) in 64-bit mode, MgraControlList() internally calls the MIL_DOUBLE version of this function (MgraControlListDouble()). If you need to pass large integer values (including pointers), call the MIL_INT64 version of this function (MgraControlListInt64()). Parameters Parameters GraListId Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics list to control. The 2D graphics list must have been previously allocated on the required system using MgraAllocList(). LabelOrIndex Specifies the graphic (one or all) to control. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For specifying the 2D graphics list or graphic therein Value Description M_GRAPHIC_INDEX( MIL_INT Index ) Specifies the index of an existing graphic on which to apply the control setting. Parameters Index Specifies the index. The index is from 0 (inclusive) to the total number of graphics in the list minus 1. You can get the number graphics in the list using MgraInquireList() with M_NUMBER_OF_GRAPHICS. If the control setting is not supported on the graphic specified, an error is generated. For example, a dot (MgraDot()) cannot be scaled (M_APPLY_SCALE) or rotated (M_ROTATE). M_GRAPHIC_LABEL( MIL_INT Label ) Specifies the label of an existing graphic on which to apply the control setting. Parameters Label Specifies the label. The label must be greater than 0. You can retrieve the label of the last graphic added to the list using MgraInquireList() with M_LAST_LABEL. If the control setting is not supported on the graphic specified, an error is generated. For example, a dot (MgraDot()) cannot be scaled (M_APPLY_SCALE) or rotated (M_ROTATE). M_ALL Applies the specified control setting to all the graphics contained within the 2D graphics list. The graphics that do not support the specified control type setting remain unchanged. M_ALL_SELECTED Applies the specified control setting to all the graphics contained within the 2D graphics list that are currently selected (that is, all graphics with M_GRAPHIC_SELECTED set to M_TRUE). The graphics that are not selected remain unchanged. M_LIST Applies the specified control setting to the 2D graphics list itself. SubIndex Specifies the index of the sub-element of the graphic on which to apply the control setting. If this information is not required or supported, set this parameter to M_DEFAULT. For specifying the index of a graphic's sub-element Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies to apply the control setting to the graphic itself (instead of just a sub-element). 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= M_NUMBER_OF_SUB_ELEMENTS Specifies the index of the sub-element of the graphic on which to apply the control setting. The following table lists all the graphics for which you can control their individual sub-elements and outlines how sub-indices are assigned for each of these. Graphics types Index of sub-element values Dots (created using MgraDots()). The indices, starting from 0, are assigned to each dot in order of creation. A single line (created using MgraLine() or user-defined using MgraInteractive() set to M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_LINE). 0 is assigned to the specified start point, and 1 is assigned to the specified end point of the line. Sets of finite length lines (created using MgraLines() with M_LINE_LIST). The indices, starting from 0, are assigned to the specified start point and end point of each line, in order of creation. For example, the start point of the first line has an index of 0 and the end point has an index of 1, and the start point of the second line has an index of 2 and the end point has an index of 3. Sets of infinite lines (created using MgraLines() with M_INFINITE_LINES). The indices, starting from 0, are assigned to the first and second specified point of each line, in order of creation. For example, the first specified point of the first line has an index of 0 and its second specified point has an index of 1, and the first specified point of the second line has an index of 2 and its second specified point has an index of 3. A polygon (created using MgraLines() with M_POLYGON or user-defined using MgraInteractive() set to M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_POLYGON). The indices, starting from 0, are assigned to each polygon vertex in order of creation. A polyline (created using MgraLines() with M_POLYLINE or user-defined using MgraInteractive() set to M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_POLYLINE). The indices, starting from 0, are assigned to each polyline point in order of creation. ControlType Specifies the 2D graphics list setting to control. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ControlValue Specifies the value to assign to the 2D graphics list setting. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Parameter associations The tables below list possible values for the ControlType and ControlValue parameters. For changing general settings of the 2D graphics list itself For changing the general settings inherited from the 2D graphics context For changing the interactive properties of graphics in the list For changing the settings of text For changing the position and dimensional information of a graphic For performing geometric operations on graphics For deleting graphics (one or all) from the list For specifying general keyboard key settings to interactively modify graphics For specifying explicit keyboard keys to interactively modify graphics The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to change general settings of a 2D graphics list itself.

When drawing in a 16-bit or 32-bit multi-band buffer, the components of the RGB value are cast to the type of the destination buffer's bands. To specify a 16-bit or 32-bit color component, use MgraControlList() with M_INTERACTIVE_ANNOTATIONS_COLOR combined with the appropriate constant (M_RED, M_GREEN, or M_BLUE). Parameters Red Specifies the red component, as a value between 0 and 255. Green Specifies the green component, as a value between 0 and 255.

M_RGB888( MIL_INT Red, MIL_INT Green, MIL_INT Blue ) Specifies an RGB value when drawing in an 8-bit, 3-band buffer. The red, green, and blue values must be between 0 and 255, inclusive. When drawing in a 16-bit or 32-bit multi-band buffer, the components of the RGB value are cast to the type of the destination buffer's bands. To specify a 16-bit or 32-bit color component, use MgraControlList() with M_SELECTED_COLOR combined with the appropriate constant (M_RED, M_GREEN, or M_BLUE). Parameters Red Specifies the red component, as a value between 0 and 255. Green Specifies the green component, as a value between 0 and 255.

If the given value exceeds the range of the possible values that can be stored in each band of the destination buffer, the least significant bits of the value are used. M_SELECTION_RADIUS Sets the size of the selection-radius in interactive mode. Selection-radius refers to how close a mouse click needs to be to a graphic to select it. For example if a graphic is at a position that is 4 units radially away from where you clicked, the graphic will appear selected if the selection-radius is set to a value greater than or equal to 4 units. Value &gt;= 1.0 Specifies the size of the selection-radius, in display units (these are pixel units that remain unaltered when you pan or zoom the display). The default value is 8.0. Combination values for [when ControlType=M_MODE_RESIZE and ControlValue=M_FIXED_CENTER: M_FIXED_CENTER ], [when ControlType=M_MODE_RESIZE and ControlValue=M_FIXED_CORNER: M_FIXED_CORNER]. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to specify the aspect ratio when resizing the graphic. The following values will not modify the graphic's aspect ratio if it is set to 1 using MgraControlList() with M_CONSTRAIN_ASPECT_RATIO. For specifying the aspect ratio when resizing the graphic Combination value Description M_FIXED_ASPECT_RATIO Specifies that the aspect ratio of the graphic remains constant when resizing it. M_NO_CONSTRAINT Specifies that the aspect ratio of the graphic can change when resizing it. This is the default value. M_SQUARE_ASPECT_RATIO Specifies that the aspect ratio of the graphic will be 1:1 (square) when resizing it.

Unless otherwise specified, these affect all types of graphics. In this case, the LabelOrIndex parameter can be set to one or all graphics and the SubIndex parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. For changing the general settings inherited from the 2D graphics context ControlType Description ControlValue M_COLOR Sets the foreground color of the graphic. M_RGB888( MIL_INT Red, MIL_INT Green, MIL_INT Blue ) Specifies an RGB value when drawing in an 8-bit, 3-band buffer. The red, green, and blue values must be between 0 and 255, inclusive. When drawing in a 16-bit or 32-bit multi-band buffer, the components of the RGB value are cast to the type of the destination buffer's bands. To specify a 16-bit or 32-bit color component, use MgraControlList() with M_COLOR combined with the appropriate constant (M_RED, M_GREEN, or M_BLUE). Parameters Red Specifies the red component, as a value between 0 and 255. Green Specifies the green component, as a value between 0 and 255.

M_COLOR_LIGHT_WHITE Specifies the color light white. M_COLOR_MAGENTA Specifies the color magenta. M_COLOR_RED Specifies the color red. M_COLOR_WHITE Specifies the color white. M_COLOR_YELLOW Specifies the color yellow. Value Specifies a grayscale value. The buffer can be a 1-band or multi-band buffer. The specified value is cast to the buffer type and depth. The default value is -1. For example, this value is equivalent to 0xFF for an 8-bit buffer. Note that a grayscale value can be any integer or floating-point number. If the given value exceeds the range of the possible values that can be stored in each band of the destination buffer, the least significant bits of the value are used. M_DRAW_DIRECTION Sets how to draw (render) an arrow pointing in the direction with which a graphic was defined. This only affects graphics that are not filled, and that have such a direction as part of their definition; for example, arc, ellipse, line, rectangle, and ring. MIL ignores this setting for other graphics. This setting does not affect drawings created using a processing or analysis module draw function (M...Draw()). For more information about how the directions are drawn for different graphics, see the Drawing graphics in a calibrated image subsection of the Drawing graphics section of Chapter 26: Generating graphics. M_NONE Specifies that no direction is drawn. M_PRIMARY_DIRECTION Specifies to draw an arrow showing the primary direction of the graphic. For example, if you draw the primary direction for a rectangle defined with MgraRectAngle(), the arrow will point in the angular direction set with the Angle parameter. M_PRIMARY_DIRECTION + M_SECONDARY_DIRECTION Specifies to draw an arrow showing both the primary and secondary direction of the graphic. M_SECONDARY_DIRECTION Specifies to draw an arrow showing the secondary direction of the graphic. For example, a rectangle's secondary direction is equal to its PrimaryDirection - 90°. M_DRAW_OFFSET_X Sets the offset to subtract from the source X-coordinates before rendering the graphic. This is useful to take results obtained relative to an offset and draw them relative to the top-left corner of the destination image of a draw operation. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0 pixels. Value Specifies the X-coordinate offset to subtract, in pixels. M_DRAW_OFFSET_Y Sets the offset to subtract from the source Y-coordinates before rendering the graphic. This is useful to take results obtained relative to an offset and draw them relative to the top-left corner of the destination image of a draw operation. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0 pixels. Value Specifies the Y-coordinate offset to subtract, in pixels. M_DRAW_ZOOM_X Sets the scaling factor in the X-direction. This value is useful to zoom in on drawings of results. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the scaling factor in the X-direction. M_DRAW_ZOOM_Y Sets the scaling factor in the Y-direction. This value is useful to zoom in on drawings of results. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the scaling factor in the Y-direction. M_FIXTURE Sets the camera calibration information to use when rendering (drawing or displaying) a graphic that has been defined in world units (M_INPUT_UNITS set to M_WORLD). MIL can interpret positioning and dimensioning information of the graphic solely using the camera calibration information associated with the destination image buffer (or the image buffer selected to the display). Alternatively, you can have MIL use the explicitly specified camera calibration information (M_GRAPHIC_SOURCE_CALIBRATION). If only the destination or the graphic is associated with camera calibration information, it will be used to render the graphic. However, if both are available, you should use M_FIXTURE to identify with respect to which of their relative coordinate systems has positioning and dimensioning information been specified. If with respect to that of the destination camera calibration information (M_USE_DESTINATION_FIRST), the source camera calibration information is not used. If with respect to that of the source camera calibration information (M_USE_SOURCE_FIRST), positions and dimensions are transformed from this relative coordinate system to the absolute coordinate system; then, since it is assumed that there is only one absolute coordinate system, these positions and dimensions are transformed from the absolute coordinate system to the pixel coordinate system, using the destination camera calibration information. M_USE_DESTINATION_FIRST Specifies that the camera calibration information of the destination is used when rendering the graphic. In this case, the graphic follows the relative coordinate system of the destination. This is most often used when working with ROIs. M_USE_SOURCE_FIRST Specifies that the camera calibration information of the graphic, set with M_GRAPHIC_SOURCE_CALIBRATION, is used when rendering the graphic. In this case, the graphic is positioned independent of the destination's relative coordinate system; the destination camera calibration information is only used, if available, for the world to pixel mapping. M_GRAPHIC_CONVERSION_MODE Sets how the shape of a graphic, defined in world units, is converted to pixels (rendered). Drawings created using a processing or analysis module draw function (M...Draw()) ignore this control type; instead the graphics are drawn using settings defined in their respective modules. M_PRESERVE_SHAPE_AVERAGE Specifies to render the graphic so that its shape is preserved even if it means not respecting the camera calibration information exactly. For example, a rectangle in world units will be mapped to a rectangle in pixel units, even if the accurate conversion would not yield a rectangle. This setting applies only to dots (MgraDot() and MgraDots()) and to rectangles (MgraRect() and MgraRectAngle()). M_RESHAPE_FOLLOWING_DISTORTION Specifies that all points along the contour of the graphic will be converted using the camera calibration information, following any non-linear distortion. This mode is slower, but more accurate. M_RESHAPE_FROM_POINTS Specifies that only a few key points or features will be converted using the camera calibration information; from these points, the rest of the graphic will be rendered respecting the shape of the graphic. For example, when converting a line segment from world to pixel units, the two end points are mapped to pixel units, and then a straight line is drawn connecting these two points, ignoring any non-linear distortion in-between. This is the fastest mode, and is accurate as long as there is only linear distortion. M_GRAPHIC_SOURCE_CALIBRATION Sets the camera calibration information to use to interpret positioning and dimensioning information of a graphic defined in world units (M_INPUT_UNITS set to M_WORLD), if you have set M_FIXTURE to M_USE_SOURCE_FIRST. If the destination also has camera calibration information, positioning and dimensioning information are transformed from the relative coordinate system of the source camera calibration information to its absolute coordinate system. Then, since it is assumed that there is only one absolute coordinate system, the dimensions and positions are transformed from the absolute coordinate system to the pixel coordinate system, using the destination camera calibration information. Note that this camera calibration information is also used if you have set M_FIXTURE to M_USE_DESTINATION_FIRST, but the graphic is drawn in an image buffer that has no camera calibration information. M_NULL Specifies that no source camera calibration information is available to interpret positioning and dimensioning information of a graphic defined in world units. MIL identifier Specifies the identifier of a camera calibration context, image buffer or processing or analysis module result buffer, whose camera calibration information to use. Note that the camera calibration information of this object is copied to an internal camera calibration context; the specified object is not associated with the 2D graphics list. Since the information is being copied, MgraInquireList() will not return the same identifier as the one passed to MgraControlList(); instead it will return the identifier of the copy. This identifier is automatically generated by MIL. If, for example, the relative coordinate system changes after using M_GRAPHIC_SOURCE_CALIBRATION, it will have no effect on the graphic. M_INPUT_UNITS Sets the unit with which to interpret the graphic's positional and dimensional information, for graphics already added to the 2D graphics list. This essentially sets the input coordinate system to use. M_DISPLAY Specifies to interpret the values in pixel units that, unlike M_PIXEL, are not altered when the display is panned or zoomed. This can be useful if, for example, you always want to display the camera's current frame rate at the top-left corner. M_DISPLAY must only be specified when the 2D graphics list is used to annotate the display non-destructively, using MdispControl() with M_ASSOCIATED_GRAPHIC_LIST_ID. M_PIXEL Specifies to interpret the values in pixel units, with respect to the pixel coordinate system. If the 2D graphics list is used to annotate the display non-destructively (M_ASSOCIATED_GRAPHIC_LIST_ID), the graphics will be zoomed and panned according to the display's zoom and pan settings. This is not the case when setting the units to M_DISPLAY, which also uses pixel units. M_WORLD Specifies to interpret the values in world units, with respect to the relative coordinate system. If the 2D graphics list is used to annotate the display non-destructively (M_ASSOCIATED_GRAPHIC_LIST_ID), the graphic will be zoomed and panned according to the display's zoom and pan settings. When using M_WORLD, a graphic's coordinates are interpreted as real-world values and transformed to pixel values before being drawn or associated with the display non-destructively. Note that using the camera calibration information associated with the image (M_WORLD), ensures that whenever the relative coordinate system moves (for example, with McalRelativeOrigin(), McalSetCoordinateSystem(), or McalFixture()), the non-destructive annotations move accordingly. In this case, the position of the graphics is set according to the position of the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, calling MgraDraw() generates an error if the operation is performed on an uncalibrated image and M_GRAPHIC_SOURCE_CALIBRATION is set to M_NULL. When the 2D graphics list is associated with the display, nothing will be drawn. M_LINE_THICKNESS Sets the thickness of the lines and the diameter of dots, depending on the drawing operation. Note that for this setting, the thickness of the line is not affected by panning or zooming, and is always interpreted in pixel units. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the thickness of the lines and diameter of the dots, in pixels. The value must be an odd integer. The default value is 1 pixel. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to change settings inherited from the 2D graphics context that affect the interactivity of a graphic, drawn in a 2D graphics list associated with a display, when interactive mode is enabled (MdispControl() with M_GRAPHIC_LIST_INTERACTIVE set to M_ENABLE). You can still change these settings even if interactive mode is disabled, but they will have no effect until interactive mode is enabled. If you attempt to change one of these settings to M_ENABLE for a graphics type that cannot be assigned this value, an error is generated. In this case, the LabelOrIndex parameter can be set to one or all graphics and the SubIndex parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. For changing the interactive properties of graphics in the list ControlType Description ControlValue M_EDITABLE Sets whether a graphic can be edited, via user interaction in an interactive display.

This setting applies to all types of graphics except a dot (MgraDot()), dots (MgraDots()), text (MgraText()), sets of finite length lines (MgraLines() with M_LINE_LIST), and drawings created using a processing or analysis module draw function (M...Draw()). Enabling this setting when specifying an unsupported graphic type will generate an error. M_DISABLE Specifies that the graphic cannot be rotated via user interaction and the rotate handle will not be displayed if a graphic is selected. Note that the graphic can still be rotated using MgraControlList(). M_ENABLE Specifies that the graphic can be rotated via user interaction by clicking and dragging the rotation handle. M_SELECTABLE Sets whether a graphic can be selected, via user interaction in an interactive display. If a graphic is not visible, it is not selectable and this setting is ignored.

Enabling this setting when specifying an unsupported graphic type will generate an error. M_DISABLE Specifies that the graphic cannot be selected via user interaction. Note that the graphic can still be selected using MgraControlList(). M_ENABLE Specifies that the graphic can be selected by clicking on it. M_SPECIFIC_FEATURES_EDITABLE Sets whether a graphic can be modified using handles that are specific to its graphic type via user interaction in an interactive display. If a graphic is not visible, not selectable, or not editable, it cannot be modified using type-specific handles and the setting is ignored. This setting applies to all types of graphics except dots (MgraDots()), text (MgraText()), sets of finite length lines (MgraLines() with M_LINE_LIST), and drawings created using a processing or analysis module draw function (M...Draw()). Enabling this setting when specifying an unsupported graphic type will generate an error. M_DISABLE Specifies that the graphic cannot be modified via user interaction and its specific feature handles will not be displayed if a graphic is selected. Note that the graphic can still be modified using MgraControlList(). M_ENABLE Specifies that the graphic can be modified via user interaction by clicking and dragging one of the type-specific handles. M_TRANSLATABLE Sets whether a graphic can be translated (moved), via user interaction in an interactive display.

This setting applies to all types of graphics except dots (MgraDots()), text (MgraText()), sets of finite length lines (MgraLines() with M_LINE_LIST), and drawings created using a processing or analysis module draw function (M...Draw()). Enabling this setting when specifying an unsupported graphic type will generate an error. M_DISABLE Specifies that the graphic cannot be moved via user interaction. Note that the graphic can still be moved using MgraControlList(). M_ENABLE Specifies that the graphic can be moved via user interaction by clicking and dragging the graphic, its selection box, or its center handle.

This setting applies to all types of graphics. M_FALSE Specifies that the graphic is not rendered. M_TRUE Specifies that the graphic is rendered. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to change the settings inherited from the 2D graphics context when text (MgraText()) is added to the list. In this case, the LabelOrIndex parameter can be set to the label or index of text in the 2D graphics list and the SubIndex parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. Attempting to change one of the following settings on graphics other than text will generate an error. For changing the settings of text ControlType Description ControlValue M_BACKCOLOR Sets the background color of the text. M_RGB888( MIL_INT Red, MIL_INT Green, MIL_INT Blue ) Specifies an RGB value when drawing in an 8-bit, 3-band buffer. The red, green, and blue values must be between 0 and 255, inclusive. When drawing in a 16-bit or 32-bit multi-band buffer, the components of the RGB value are cast to the type of the destination buffer's bands. To specify a 16-bit or 32-bit color component, use MgraControlList() with M_BACKCOLOR combined with the appropriate constant (M_RED, M_GREEN, or M_BLUE). Parameters Red Specifies the red component, as a value between 0 and 255. Green Specifies the green component, as a value between 0 and 255.

Note that a grayscale value can be any integer or floating-point number. If the given value exceeds the range of the possible values that can be stored in each band of the destination buffer, the least significant bits of the value are used. M_BACKGROUND_MODE Sets whether to fill the text's background. M_OPAQUE Specifies that the background will be filled with the current background color before drawing text. M_TRANSPARENT Specifies not to change the background before drawing text. This creates a transparent background for printed characters. M_FONT Sets the font of the characters in the text. Note that the non-bitmap fonts will use TrueType and Unicode features to draw text. This allows you to draw text using different sizes and TrueType fonts installed on your computer. This also allows you to draw any Unicode text (depending on the font). M_FONT_DEFAULT Same as M_FONT_DEFAULT_SMALL. M_FONT_DEFAULT_LARGE Specifies a large bitmap font, where each character is drawn in a 16x32 pixel area. M_FONT_DEFAULT_MEDIUM Specifies a medium bitmap font, where each character is drawn in a 12x24 pixel area. M_FONT_DEFAULT_SMALL Specifies a small bitmap font, where each character is drawn in a 8x16 pixel area. M_FONT_DEFAULT_TTF Specifies the default TrueType font of your operating system. MIL_TEXT(\"FontFamily:Weight:Slant\") 1 Specifies the font according to the following format, Family: Weight: Slant.

Slant can be set to one of the following: Italic, Oblique, or Roman. You can omit Weight and Slant; also, you can provide the Weight and Slant in any order. Note, if using a C compiler, you must pass the value as M_PTR_TO_MIL_INT(MIL_TEXT(\"FontFamily:Weight:Slant\")). MIL_TEXT(\"FontFile\") 1 Specifies a full path to a TrueType file name. Note, if using a C compiler, you must pass the value as M_PTR_TO_MIL_INT(MIL_TEXT(\"FontFile\")). M_FONT_AUTO_SELECT Sets whether MIL should search for a suitable font to draw the text, if the currently selected font (M_FONT) is a TrueType font that does not support the character code. MIL will first attempt to make its selection from already used fonts, and then from system fonts. M_DISABLE Specifies that MIL will not search for a suitable font. An error is returned if the character code cannot be drawn using the current TrueType font. M_ENABLE Specifies that MIL will search for a suitable font. M_FONT_SIZE Sets the font size, when using a TrueType font. When using a bitmap font, use M_FONT_X_SCALE and M_FONT_Y_SCALE to set the font size. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the text's font size, in points. M_FONT_X_SCALE Sets the font's horizontal scaling factor. This setting only applies to bitmap fonts.

The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to change a graphic's characteristics that have been set using the Mgra...() function with which the graphic was added to the list. In this case, the LabelOrIndex parameter can be set to one or all graphics. Unless otherwise specified, the SubIndex parameter should be set to M_DEFAULT. For changing the position and dimensional information of a graphic ControlType Description ControlValue M_ANGLE Sets the angle of the graphic. This setting applies to all types of graphics except dot (MgraDot()), text (MgraText()), and drawings created using a processing or analysis module draw function (M...Draw()). -360.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 360.0 Specifies the angle, in degrees, relative to the input coordinate system specified using M_INPUT_UNITS. An angle interpreted with respect to the pixel coordinate system is always measured counter-clockwise. For information on the angle's direction of rotation when interpreting the angle with respect to the relative coordinate system, see the Angle convention in MIL subsection of the Working with real-world units section of Chapter 28: Calibrating your camera setup. M_ANGLE_END Sets the angle at which to stop drawing the arc. This setting only applies to arcs (MgraArc(), MgraArcFill(), and MgraArcAngle()). Value Specifies the end angle, in degrees, relative to the input coordinate system specified using M_INPUT_UNITS. An angle interpreted with respect to the pixel coordinate system is always measured counter-clockwise.

M_ARC_STYLE Sets whether to draw an arc or a sector. This setting only applies to arcs (MgraArc(), MgraArcFill(), and MgraArcAngle()). M_CONTOUR Specifies that the arc (the curve between the specified start and end angles) is drawn without lines extending from the center of the ellipse to the start and end points of the arc. M_SECTOR Specifies that a sector is drawn with lines extending from the center of the ellipse to the start and end points of the arc, unless the specified start and end angles form a closed curve. M_CONSTRAIN_ASPECT_RATIO Sets whether to force the width and height of a graphic to be equal. This affects both interactive and programmatic manipulations. This setting applies to arcs (MgraArc(), MgraArcFill(), and MgraArcAngle()) and rectangles (MgraRect(), MgraRectFill(), and MgraRectAngle()). M_DISABLE Specifies that the width and height of a graphic are not forced to be equal. 1.0 Specifies that the width and height of a graphic are forced to be equal. This is considered a 1:1 (square) aspect ratio. Changing this setting on a graphic that does not meet this condition will change the dimensions of the graphic accordingly. Any attempts to change one of the dimensions, either programmatically or interactively, will scale the other so that the condition (1:1) is met. M_FILLED Sets whether to fill the graphic. This setting only applies to arcs (MgraArc(), MgraArcFill(), and MgraArcAngle()), polygons (MgraLines() with M_POLYGON), and rectangles (MgraRect(), MgraRectFill(), and MgraRectAngle()). M_FALSE Specifies that the graphic is not filled. M_TRUE Specifies that the graphic is filled. M_POSITION_TYPE Sets how to interpret M_POSITION_X and M_POSITION_Y for a rectangle. This setting only applies to rectangles (MgraRect(), MgraRectFill(), and MgraRectAngle()). M_CENTER_AND_DIMENSION Specifies to interpret M_POSITION_X and M_POSITION_Y as the rectangle's center. M_CORNER_AND_DIMENSION Specifies to interpret M_POSITION_X and M_POSITION_Y as the rectangle's top-left corner. M_POSITION_X Sets the X-position of a graphic, or of one of its sub-elements (position-points). If SubIndex is set to M_DEFAULT, this setting affects the entire graphic. If a sub-element is specified, a single point, within the graphic, is affected by this setting. This setting applies to all types of graphics except drawings created using a processing or analysis module draw function (M...Draw()). Value Specifies the X-position. You can specify any positive or negative value. M_POSITION_Y Sets the Y-position of a graphic, or of one of its sub-elements (position-points). If SubIndex is set to M_DEFAULT, this setting affects the entire graphic. If a sub-element is specified, a single point, within the graphic, is affected by this setting. This setting applies to all types of graphics except drawings created using a processing or analysis module draw function (M...Draw()). Value Specifies the Y-position. You can specify any positive or negative value. M_RADIUS_X Sets the radius of the arc in the X-direction. This setting only applies to arcs (MgraArc(), MgraArcFill(), and MgraArcAngle()). Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the radius. M_RADIUS_Y Sets the radius of the arc in the Y-direction. This setting only applies to arcs (MgraArc(), MgraArcFill(), and MgraArcAngle()). Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the radius. M_RECTANGLE_HEIGHT Sets the height of the rectangle. This setting only applies to rectangles (MgraRect(), MgraRectFill(), and MgraRectAngle()). Value Specifies the height. M_RECTANGLE_WIDTH Sets the width of the rectangle. This setting only applies to rectangles (MgraRect(), MgraRectFill(), and MgraRectAngle()). Value Specifies the width. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to perform geometric operations on graphics. Using one of the following operations on a graphic will change its current position and dimensional settings (the settings listed in the For changing the position and dimensional information of a graphic table). Once an operation has occurred, the value specified cannot be inquired. In this case, the LabelOrIndex parameter can be set to one or all graphics. Unless otherwise specified, the SubIndex parameter should be set to M_DEFAULT. For performing geometric operations on graphics ControlType Description ControlValue M_APPLY_SCALE Performs a uniform scaling operation on the graphic. A uniform scaling operation enlarges or shrinks graphics by a scale factor in both X- and Y-directions, relative to the point specified by M_POSITION_X and M_POSITION_Y; the point specified by M_POSITION_X and M_POSITION_Y remains the same after a uniform scaling operation. For example, if you specify a scale factor of one half to dots (MgraDots()), each dot will have its distance from M_POSITION_X and M_POSITION_Y reduced by one half. This setting applies to all types of graphics except dot (MgraDot()) and drawings created using a processing or analysis module draw function (M...Draw()). Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the scale factor. M_RESIZE_HEIGHT Increases or decreases the graphic's height. This does not affect the graphic's X- and Y-position (M_POSITION_X and M_POSITION_Y remains the same). MIL typically resizes the height on both sides of the graphic; therefore, the height is actually modified by twice the specified resize value. This does not occur for rectangle graphics whose position (M_POSITION_TYPE) is interpreted as its top-left corner (M_CORNER_AND_DIMENSION). In that case, MIL only applies the resize value to the opposite side. This setting applies to all types of graphics except dot (MgraDot()), text (MgraText()), and drawings created using a processing or analysis module draw function (M...Draw()). Value Specifies the value by which to resize the height. M_RESIZE_WIDTH Increases or decreases the graphic's width. This does not affect the graphic's X- and Y-position (M_POSITION_X and M_POSITION_Y remains the same). MIL typically resizes the width on both sides of the graphic; therefore, the width is actually modified by twice the specified resize value. This does not occur for rectangle graphics whose position (M_POSITION_TYPE) is interpreted as its top-left corner (M_CORNER_AND_DIMENSION). In that case, MIL only applies the resize value to the opposite side. This setting applies to all types of graphics except dot (MgraDot()), text (MgraText()), and drawings created using a processing or analysis module draw function (M...Draw()). Value Specifies the value by which to resize the width. M_ROTATE Performs a rotation operation on the graphic, or one of its sub-elements. Graphics are rotated around the point specified with M_POSITION_X and M_POSITION_Y. This setting applies to all types of graphics except dot (MgraDot()), text (MgraText()), and drawings created using a processing or analysis module draw function (M...Draw()). -360.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 360.0 Specifies the angle of rotation, in degrees, relative to the input coordinate system specified using M_INPUT_UNITS. The value specified will be added to the graphic's current angle (M_ANGLE). An angle interpreted with respect to the pixel coordinate system is always measured counter-clockwise. For information on the angle's direction of rotation when interpreting the angle with respect to the relative coordinate system, see the Angle convention in MIL subsection of the Working with real-world units section of Chapter 28: Calibrating your camera setup. M_TRANSLATE_X Performs a horizontal translation of a graphic, or of one of its sub-elements. If SubIndex is set to M_DEFAULT, this setting affects the entire graphic. If a sub-element is specified, a single point, within the graphic, is affected by this setting. This setting applies to all types of graphics except drawings created using a processing or analysis module draw function (M...Draw()). Value Specifies the horizontal displacement. You can specify any positive or negative value. The value specified will be added to the graphic's current X-position (M_POSITION_X). M_TRANSLATE_Y Performs a vertical translation of a graphic, or of one of its sub-elements. If SubIndex is set to M_DEFAULT, this setting affects the entire graphic. If a sub-element is specified, a single point, within the graphic, is affected by this setting. This setting applies to all types of graphics except drawings created using a processing or analysis module draw function (M...Draw()). Value Specifies the vertical displacement. You can specify any positive or negative value. The value specified will be added to the graphic's current Y-position (M_POSITION_Y). Combination value for M_POSITION_TYPE. You can add the following value to the above-mentioned value to specify that a rectangle should stay at the same location in the image regardless of how MIL interprets its reference position. For specifying that a rectangle should stay at the same location regardless of how MIL interprets its position Combination value Description M_SAME_LOCATION Specifies that, when you set M_POSITION_TYPE, MIL also adjusts the rectangle's actual position in the image so it remains at the same location. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to delete graphics from the 2D graphics list. The LabelOrIndex parameter can be set to one or all graphics and the SubIndex parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. For deleting graphics (one or all) from the list ControlType Description ControlValue M_DELETE Deletes the graphic (one or all), as specified by the LabelOrIndex parameter setting. When a graphic is deleted, the indices of the 2D graphics list are reassigned; that is, index values greater than that of the removed graphic are reduced by one. M_DEFAULT Implements the default behavior. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to specify general settings for using keyboard keys to interactively modify graphics. In this case, set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_LIST and the SubIndex parameter to M_DEFAULT. These settings apply to the 2D graphics list itself. For specifying general keyboard key settings to interactively modify graphics ControlType Description ControlValue M_ACTION_KEYS Sets whether the 2D graphics list allows you to interactively modify its graphics by pressing keys on the keyboard (keyboard events). M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that the 2D graphics list ignores keyboard events. M_ENABLE Specifies that the 2D graphics list allows keyboard events to interactively modify its graphics. In this case, you must still enable the 2D graphics list's interactivity (MdispControl() with M_GRAPHIC_LIST_INTERACTIVE). M_ACTION_MODIFIER_SPEED Set the additional keyboard key that you can press to select an alternate speed to rotate, resize, or translate interactively selected graphics with the keyboard. This affects M_ACTION_KEY_ROTATE_..., M_ACTION_KEY_RESIZE_..., and M_ACTION_KEY_TRANSLATE_... settings. M_DEFAULT Same as M_KEY_CTRL.

This affects the M_ACTION_KEY_RESIZE_... settings. Note that if the graphic is in world units, the increment is converted to world units using the calibration's average pixel size in the resizing direction. To keep the graphic's position fixed, MIL typically applies this increment value to both sides of the graphic. Therefore, the graphic's width or height is actually modified by twice the specified value. This does not occur for rectangle graphics whose position (M_POSITION_TYPE) is interpreted as its top-left corner (M_CORNER_AND_DIMENSION). In that case, MIL only applies the increment to the opposite side. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0.

M_ACTION_RESIZE_INCREMENT_ALTERNATE Sets an alternate value with which to increase or decrease the width or height of the interactively selected graphic for a single key press. M_ACTION_RESIZE_INCREMENT_ALTERNATE behaves like M_ACTION_RESIZE_INCREMENT. MIL uses M_ACTION_RESIZE_INCREMENT_ALTERNATE instead of M_ACTION_RESIZE_INCREMENT when you press the key specified for M_ACTION_MODIFIER_SPEED while you resize the graphic using the keyboard. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 10.0. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the increment, in display units (these are pixel units that remain unaltered when you pan or zoom the display). M_ACTION_ROTATE_INCREMENT Sets the angle with which to rotate the interactively selected graphic for a single key press. This affects the M_ACTION_KEY_ROTATE_... settings. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0°. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the angle, in degrees. M_ACTION_ROTATE_INCREMENT_ALTERNATE Sets an alternate angle with which to rotate the interactively selected graphic for a single key press. M_ACTION_ROTATE_INCREMENT_ALTERNATE behaves like M_ACTION_ROTATE_INCREMENT. MIL uses M_ACTION_ROTATE_INCREMENT_ALTERNATE instead of M_ACTION_ROTATE_INCREMENT when you press the key specified for M_ACTION_MODIFIER_SPEED while you rotate the graphic using the keyboard. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 15.0°. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the angle, in degrees. M_ACTION_TRANSLATE_AXES Set the axes along which MIL translates a graphic that is in world units, when the translation is done using the keyboard. This affects M_ACTION_TRANSLATE_INCREMENT and M_ACTION_TRANSLATE_INCREMENT_ALTERNATE. M_DEFAULT Same as M_PIXEL. M_ACCORDING_TO_CALIBRATION Specifies to convert the translation increment to world units using the calibration's average pixel size in the translation direction, then apply it along the world axes. M_PIXEL Specifies to apply the translation increment to the graphic position, along the image axes, in display units (these are pixel units that remain unaltered when you pan or zoom the display). M_ACTION_TRANSLATE_INCREMENT Sets the value with which to translate (move) the interactively selected graphics for a single key press. This affects the M_ACTION_KEY_TRANSLATE_... settings. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the increment, in display units (these are pixel units that remain unaltered when you pan or zoom the display). Note that if the graphic is in world units, the behavior depends on M_ACTION_TRANSLATE_AXES. M_ACTION_TRANSLATE_INCREMENT_ALTERNATE Sets an alternate value with which to translate (move) the interactively selected graphics for a single key press. M_ACTION_TRANSLATE_INCREMENT_ALTERNATE behaves like M_ACTION_TRANSLATE_INCREMENT. MIL uses M_ACTION_TRANSLATE_INCREMENT_ALTERNATE instead of M_ACTION_TRANSLATE_INCREMENT when you press the key specified for M_ACTION_MODIFIER_SPEED while you move the graphic using the keyboard. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 10.0. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the increment, in display units (these are pixel units that remain unaltered when you pan or zoom the display). Note that if the graphic is in world units, the increment depends on M_ACTION_TRANSLATE_AXES. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to specify explicit keyboard keys to interactively modify graphics. In this case, set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_LIST and the SubIndex parameter to M_DEFAULT. These settings apply to the 2D graphics list itself. For specifying explicit keyboard keys to interactively modify graphics ControlType Description ControlValue M_ACTION_KEY_CANCEL Sets the keyboard keys that you can press to cancel the interactive graphic modification you are currently performing. MIL recommends using the Esc key. If the keyboard key that you specify is used by another action setting (M_ACTION_KEY_...), MIL sets that other action setting to M_NONE. If you press the specified cancel key while you are interactively translating (moving), resizing, or rotating the graphic, MIL returns the graphic to its initial state (before you started interacting with it). If you press the specified cancel key while interactively creating the graphic, MIL removes from the display any part of the graphic you started to define, and also removes the graphic from the 2D graphics list (the graphic is typically added to the 2D graphics list before it is entirely defined). If you press the specified cancel key when there is no interaction to cancel, MIL deselects all selected graphics. M_ACTION_KEY_CANCEL only has an effect if you enable M_ACTION_KEYS.

Syntax void MgraCopy( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcListGraId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstListGraId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Operation, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;InsertLocation, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;NumGraphics, //in const MIL_INT&nbsp;*SrcIndexOrLabelArrayPtr, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;*DstLabelArrayPtr, //out MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function copies or moves one or more graphics from a source 2D graphics list to a destination 2D graphics list. When moved, the graphics are erased from the source 2D graphics list. You can specify the location in the destination 2D graphics list at which to insert the copied graphics, which offers some control on the drawing order. Note that if you want to replace all existing elements of the destination 2D graphics list, you must clear it first using MgraClear(). This function supports in-place processing: the source and destination 2D graphics list identifiers can refer to the same 2D graphics list. In the case of an in-place move operation (M_MOVE), the graphic referred to by the InsertLocation parameter must not be one of the graphics being moved (SrcIndexOrLabelArrayPtr). Unlike most other functions that modify a MIL object, you can call this function concurrently from multiple threads on the same MIL 2D graphics list (DstListGraId) without using an M_MUTEX object, as long as all the other parameters of the concurrent calls do not also share data. Parameters Parameters SrcListGraId Specifies the identifier of a valid 2D graphics list from which to copy or move the graphics. You must have allocated the 2D graphics list using MgraAllocList(). DstListGraId Specifies the identifier of a valid 2D graphics list in which to copy or move the graphics. You must have allocated the 2D graphics list using MgraAllocList(). In-place processing is supported; DstListGraId can refer to the same 2D graphics list as SrcListGraId. Operation Specifies the type of copy operation to perform. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the type of copy operation to perform Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_COPY + M_LABEL_VALUE. M_COPY Specifies graphics from the source 2D graphics list are copied to the destination 2D graphics list. The graphics are not deleted from the source 2D graphics list. M_MOVE Specifies graphics from the source 2D graphics list are moved to the destination 2D graphics list. The graphics are deleted from the source 2D graphics list. Combination values for the values listed in For specifying the type of copy operation to perform. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to specify whether indices or labels are given to the SrcIndexOrLabelArrayPtr parameter. For specifying whether to use indices or labels Combination value Description M_INDEX_VALUE Specifies index values are given to the SrcIndexOrLabelArrayPtr parameter. M_LABEL_VALUE Specifies labels are given to the SrcIndexOrLabelArrayPtr parameter. This is the default value. InsertLocation Specifies the location inside the destination 2D graphics list at which to insert the graphics. Note that the indices or labels passed to this parameter must refer to valid graphics. Otherwise, an error is generated. For specifying the insert location in the destination 2D graphics list Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_END_OF_LIST. M_GRAPHIC_INDEX( MIL_INT Index ) Specifies that the graphics will be inserted before the graphic with the specified index in the destination 2D graphics list. Parameters Index Specifies the index. The index is from 0 (inclusive) to the total number of graphics in the list minus 1. If the given index value is not in that range, an error is generated. You can get the number graphics in the list using MgraInquireList() with M_NUMBER_OF_GRAPHICS. You can get the index corresponding to the label of a graphic using MgraInquireList() with M_INDEX_VALUE. M_GRAPHIC_LABEL( MIL_INT Label ) Specifies that the graphics will be inserted before the graphic with the specified label in the destination 2D graphics list. Parameters Label Specifies the label. The label must be greater than 0. If the label does not exist in the destination 2D graphics list, an error is generated. You can get the label of the last graphic added to the list using MgraInquireList() with M_LAST_LABEL. You can get the label corresponding to the index of a graphic using MgraInquireList() with M_LABEL_VALUE. M_END_OF_LIST Specifies that the graphics are appended to the end of the destination 2D graphics list. NumGraphics Specifies the number of graphics to copy or move. When using a standard vector (std::vector) overload function in C++, you can pass M_DEFAULT to this parameter and MIL will automatically determine the size based on the number of items in the vector passed to the SrcIndexOrLabelArrayPtr parameter. For specifying the number of graphics to copy or move Value Description M_ALL Specifies that all the graphics from the source 2D graphics list must be copied or moved. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the number of graphics from the source 2D graphics list to be copied or moved. SrcIndexOrLabelArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumGraphics) M_NULL Specifies the address of the array containing the indices or labels of the graphics to copy from the source 2D graphics list. If the M_INDEX_VALUE combination constant is used with the Operation parameter, MIL expects the array to contain graphics indices. Otherwise, MIL expects it to contain graphics labels. The array must contain at least NumGraphics indices or labels. If NumGraphics is set to M_ALL, you must set this parameter to M_NULL. Note that the indices or labels passed to this parameter must refer to valid graphics. Otherwise, an error is generated. DstLabelArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumGraphics) M_NULL Specifies the address of the array in which to write the labels that have been automatically given to the copied or moved graphics in the destination 2D graphics list. The labels are written in the same order as the graphics are specified in the SrcIndexOrLabelArrayPtr parameter. If NumGraphics is set to M_ALL, the labels are written in index order. The array must be at least as large as the number of graphics being moved or copied (NumGraphics). If NumGraphics is set to M_ALL, determine the required size of the array using MgraInquireList() with M_NUMBER_OF_GRAPHICS. If you do not need the labels of the copied or moved graphics, this parameter can be set to M_NULL. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT.

Syntax void MgraDot( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextGraId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufOrListGraId, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;XPos, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;YPos //in ) Description This function draws a dot destructively (raster-based) in the specified image. Alternatively, this function can add a vector-based version of a dot to the specified 2D graphics list, allowing you to, for example, non-destructively annotate a display without pixelation effects upon scaling. The dot is based on a point positioned at XPos and YPos. The dot inherits all the relevant settings of the specified 2D graphics context, such as the foreground color (see MgraAlloc() for default context settings). If the dot falls outside of the specified area, it is not created. To modify or inquire 2D graphics context settings, use MgraControl() or MgraInquire(). To modify or inquire 2D graphics list settings, use MgraControlList() or MgraInquireList(). The dot's coordinates are interpreted with respect to the input coordinate system, specified using MgraControl() or MgraControlList() with M_INPUT_UNITS. Note that if you set your input coordinate system to M_WORLD and you pass MgraDot() an uncalibrated image, the function will generate an error. To create one or more dots, use MgraDots(). Unlike most other functions that modify a MIL object, you can call this function concurrently from multiple threads on the same MIL 2D graphics list (DstImageBufOrListGraId) without using an M_MUTEX object, as long as all the other parameters of the concurrent calls do not also share data. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler) in 64-bit mode, MgraDot() internally calls the MIL_DOUBLE version of this function (MgraDotDouble()). If you need to pass large integer values (including pointers), call the MIL_INT64 version of this function (MgraDotInt64()). Parameters Parameters ContextGraId Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics context. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For specifying the 2D graphics context Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the default 2D graphics context of the current MIL application is used. Note that there is a different default 2D graphics context for each thread. MIL 2D graphics context identifier Specifies a valid 2D graphics context identifier, which you have allocated using MgraAlloc(). DstImageBufOrListGraId Specifies the identifier of a valid image buffer in which to draw the dot or the identifier of a valid 2D graphics list in which to add the dot. You must have allocated the image buffer or the 2D graphics list using MbufAlloc...() or MgraAllocList(), respectively. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. XPos Specifies the X-coordinate of the dot in the input coordinate system. YPos Specifies the Y-coordinate of the dot in the input coordinate system.

Syntax void MgraDots( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextGraId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufOrListGraId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;NumberOfDots, //in const MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;*PosXArrayPtr, //in const MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;*PosYArrayPtr, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function draws one or more dots destructively (raster-based) in the specified image. Alternatively, this function can add a vector-based version of the dots to the specified 2D graphics list, allowing you to, for example, non-destructively annotate a display without pixelation effects upon scaling. Dots are based on the points positioned at PosXArrayPtr and PosYArrayPtr. The dots inherit all the relevant settings of the specified 2D graphics context, such as the foreground color (see MgraAlloc() for default context settings). If part of the dots fall outside of the specified area (image or display), that part is clipped off. To modify or inquire 2D graphics context settings, use MgraControl() or MgraInquire(). To modify or inquire 2D graphics list settings, use MgraControlList() or MgraInquireList(). The coordinates of the dots are interpreted with respect to the input coordinate system, specified using MgraControl() or MgraControlList() with M_INPUT_UNITS. Note that if you set your input coordinate system to M_WORLD and you pass MgraDots() an uncalibrated image, the function will generate an error. To create a single dot without the option of creating multiple dots, use MgraDot(). Note that prior to MIL 9.0, this function only supported integer positions; the PosXArrayPtr and PosYArrayPtr parameters only accepted arrays of type long. As of MIL 9.0, this function includes support for positions with floating-point precision. To implement this change and maintain backwards compatibility when using a C++ compiler (*.cpp), MgraDots() is available as an inline function which automatically calls MgraDotsDouble(), MgraDotsInt32(), and, MgraDotsInt64() depending on whether PosXArrayPtr and PosYArrayPtr receive arrays of type MIL_DOUBLE, MIL_INT32, or MIL_INT64, respectively. To maintain backwards compatibility when using a C compiler (*.c), MgraDots() maps to MgraDotsInt32() when working on a 32-bit system, or MgraDotsInt64() when working on a 64-bit system; you must explicitly call MgraDotsDouble() to pass PosXArrayPtr and PosYArrayPtr arrays of type MIL_DOUBLE. If you are an advanced user and want to retrieve a pointer to MgraDots(), you must use the Double, Int64, or Int32 version of this function, since MgraDots() is actually a macro or an overloaded function. Unlike most other functions that modify a MIL object, you can call this function concurrently from multiple threads on the same MIL 2D graphics list (DstImageBufOrListGraId) without using an M_MUTEX object, as long as all the other parameters of the concurrent calls do not also share data. Note that presented above is an example prototype of this function. You can call MgraDots() with the same prototype as any of the type-specific functions below, without using the function's type-specific name; that is, use MgraDots() and not, for example, MgraDotsInt32(). MIL automatically casts the data into the appropriate type. This is true except when using a C compiler. When using a C compiler, you must always call this function with its type-specific name (you cannot use the standard name of this function). Parameters Parameters ContextGraId Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics context. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For the identifier of the 2D graphics context Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the default 2D graphics context of the current MIL application is used. Note that there is a different default 2D graphics context for each thread. MIL 2D graphics context identifier Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics context, which you have allocated using MgraAlloc(). DstImageBufOrListGraId Specifies the identifier of a valid image buffer in which to draw the dots or the identifier of a valid 2D graphics list in which to add the dots. You must have allocated the image buffer or the 2D graphics list using MbufAlloc...() or MgraAllocList(), respectively. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. NumberOfDots Specifies the number of dots to draw. When using a standard vector (std::vector) overload function in C++, you can pass M_DEFAULT to this parameter and MIL will automatically determine the size based on the number of items in the vector passed to the PosXArrayPtr or PosYArrayPtr parameter. PosXArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumberOfDots) Specifies the address of the array containing the X-coordinate(s) of the dots to be drawn in the input coordinate system. PosYArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumberOfDots) Specifies the address of the array containing the Y-coordinate(s) of the dots to be drawn in the input coordinate system. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion. This parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT.

Syntax void MgraDraw( MIL_ID&nbsp;GraListId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DestImageId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function draws graphics, contained in the specified 2D graphics list, destructively (raster-based) in the specified image. A graphic's position and dimension values are interpreted with respect to the input coordinate system, specified using MgraControl() with M_INPUT_UNITS. Note that you can also use MgraControlList() with M_INPUT_UNITS to modify the input units of graphics that have already been added to the 2D graphics list. If you attempt to draw the graphics contained in the 2D graphics list using world units, but without passing MgraDraw() a calibrated image, the function will generate an error. If parts of the graphics fall outside of the specified image buffer area, those parts are clipped off. If you are drawing graphics in a 2D graphics list with interactive mode enabled (MdispControl() with M_GRAPHIC_LIST_INTERACTIVE set to M_ENABLE), selected graphics (graphics with M_GRAPHIC_SELECTED set to M_TRUE) are typically surrounded by annotations that indicate the graphic is selected, such as the selection box (represented by a dotted line) with handles that allow user interaction. By default, this function will draw the annotations that indicate the graphic is selected, unless otherwise specified. Unlike most other functions that modify a MIL object, you can call this function concurrently from multiple threads on the same MIL 2D graphics list (GraListId) without using an M_MUTEX object, as long as all the other parameters of the concurrent calls do not also share data. Parameters Parameters GraListId Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics list containing the graphics to destructively draw in the image. The 2D graphics list must have been previously allocated on the required system using MgraAllocList(). DestImageId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer in which to draw. If the 2D graphics list contains graphics set in world units, a camera calibration context must be associated with the destination image buffer; otherwise, an error is generated. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Note that you can also annotate an image non-destructively by drawing into its display's overlay buffer. ControlFlag Specifies whether to also draw the annotations that indicate whether a graphic is selected, such as the selection box and handles. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For specifying whether to draw annotations that indicate a graphic is selected Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that annotations that indicate whether a graphic is selected will be drawn destructively in the image buffer, along with the graphic. M_NO_INTERACTIVE_ANNOTATION Specifies that annotations that indicate whether a graphic is selected will not be drawn in the image buffer, even if there are selected graphics in the 2D graphics list.

Syntax void MgraFill( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextGraId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;XStart, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;YStart //in ) Description This function performs a boundary-type seed fill. It fills in an area of the specified image with the foreground color of the specified 2D graphics context, starting from the seed position (XStart, YStart). Filling occurs on adjacent pixels (vertically and horizontally to original seed pixel) that have the same value as the original seed pixel. If MgraFill() is used on a multi-band buffer, each band will be processed separately. This means that each band of the adjacent pixels will be compared with the corresponding band of the seed pixel. This can produce strange results if, for example, you try to fill the inside of a red circle with blue. The blue will spread to the whole image since the red circle does not exist in the blue band. A seed's coordinates are interpreted with respect to the input coordinate system, specified using MgraControl() with M_INPUT_UNITS. Note that if you set your input coordinate system to M_WORLD and you pass MgraFill() an uncalibrated image, the function will generate an error. Note that MgraFill() cannot be performed on graphics contained within a 2D graphics list. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler) in 64-bit mode, MgraFill() internally calls the MIL_DOUBLE version of this function (MgraFillDouble()). If you need to pass large integer values (including pointers), call the MIL_INT64 version of this function (MgraFillInt64()). Parameters Parameters ContextGraId Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics context. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For specifying the 2D graphics context Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the default 2D graphics context of the current MIL application is used. Note that there is a different default 2D graphics context for each thread. MIL 2D graphics context identifier Specifies a valid 2D graphics context identifier, which you have allocated using MgraAlloc(). DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of a valid image buffer in which to perform the filling operation. You must have allocated the image buffer using MbufAlloc...(). This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. XStart Specifies the X-coordinate of the seed position in the input coordinate system. If the specified point is not within an enclosed area, filling occurs until the boundaries of the buffer are encountered. YStart Specifies the Y-coordinate of the seed position in the input coordinate system. If the specified point is not within an enclosed area, filling occurs until the boundaries of the buffer are encountered.

Syntax void MgraHookFunction( MIL_ID&nbsp;GraListId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;HookType, //in MIL_GRA_HOOK_FUNCTION_PTR&nbsp;HookHandlerPtr, //in void&nbsp;*UserDataPtr //in-out ) Description This function allows you to attach or detach a user-defined function to a specified 2D graphics list event (for example, a modification to the 2D graphics list's contents). Once a hook-handler function is defined and hooked to an event, it is automatically called when the event occurs. You can hook more than one function to an event by making separate calls to MgraHookFunction() for each function that you want to hook. MIL automatically chains and keeps an internal list of all these hooked functions. When a function is hooked, this new function is added to the end of the list. When the event happens, all user-defined functions in the list will be executed in the same order that they were hooked to the event. You can also remove any function from the list; in this case, MIL preserves the order of the remaining functions in the list. Unlike most other functions that modify a MIL object, you can call this function concurrently from multiple threads on the same MIL 2D graphics list (GraListId) without using an M_MUTEX object, as long as all the other parameters of the concurrent calls do not also share data. Parameters Parameters GraListId Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics list to which to hook a function. The 2D graphics list must have been previously allocated on the required system using MgraAllocList(). HookType Specifies the 2D graphics list event to which to hook the function. This parameter can be set to one of the following values: For specifying the 2D graphics list event Value Description M_GRAPHIC_LIST_MODIFIED Calls the hook-handler function each time the specified 2D graphics list is modified in any way, either by a MIL function or by interactive manipulations. Any of the other events will also trigger this event, and it will always be the last event to be triggered. M_GRAPHIC_MODIFIED Calls the hook-handler function each time the specified 2D graphics list's graphics are modified by a MIL function or by interactive manipulations. This includes the creation of a new graphic (for example, using MgraLine() or by interactive manipulations), its deletion (using MgraControlList() with M_DELETE or MgraClear()) and any modification to a graphic using MgraControlList(), except for changing the selection (MgraControlList() with M_GRAPHIC_SELECTED). Note that this event can be triggered even if no modification occurred. For example, calling MgraControlList() with M_POSITION_X and passing the current value returned by MgraInquireList() with M_POSITION_X will not modify the graphic, but will still trigger the event. M_GRAPHIC_SELECTION_MODIFIED Calls the hook-handler function each time a graphic is selected or deselected, either by a MIL function or by interactive manipulations. M_INTERACTIVE_GRAPHIC_STATE_MODIFIED Calls the hook-handler function each time the specified 2D graphics list's interactive state is modified by a MIL function or by interactive manipulations. Combination value for the values listed in For specifying the 2D graphics list event. You can add the following value to the above-mentioned values to set whether to detach the hook-handler function. For detaching the hook-handler function Combination value Description M_UNHOOK Unhooks the specified function if hooked to the specified event. When you use M_UNHOOK, you must provide the same values for all the parameters as when you originally hooked the function. HookHandlerPtr Specifies the address of the function that should be called when the specified event occurs. The hook-handler function must be declared as follows: MIL_INT MFTYPE HookHandler( MIL_INT HookType, MIL_ID EventId, void *UserDataPtr ) Parameters HookType Type of 2D graphics list event that generated the call. EventId Event identifier to pass to MgraGetHookInfo() when inquiring about the hooked event. UserDataPtr User data pointer that was passed to the UserDataPtr parameter of MgraHookFunction(). Upon successful completion, the hook-handler function should return M_NULL. Note MFTYPE and MIL_GRA_HOOK_FUNCTION_PTR are reserved MIL predefined types for functions and data pointers. UserDataPtr Specifies the address of the user data that you want to make available to the hook-handler function. This address is passed to the hook-handler function, through its UserDataPtr parameter, when the specified event occurs. Set this parameter to M_NULL if not used.

Syntax MIL_INT MgraInquireList( MIL_ID&nbsp;GraListId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;LabelOrIndex, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;SubIndex, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;InquireType, //in void&nbsp;*UserVarPtr //out ) Description This function inquires information about a specified 2D graphics list, or a graphic contained within the 2D graphics list. Unlike most other functions that modify a MIL object, you can call this function concurrently from multiple threads on the same MIL 2D graphics list (GraListId) without using an M_MUTEX object, as long as all the other parameters of the concurrent calls do not also share data. Parameters Parameters GraListId Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics list about which to inquire information. The 2D graphics list must have been previously allocated on the required system using MgraAllocList(). LabelOrIndex Specifies the graphic about which to inquire, or specifies to inquire about the 2D graphics list itself. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the graphic or the 2D graphics list Value Description M_GRAPHIC_INDEX( MIL_INT Index ) Specifies the index of an existing graphic about which to inquire. Parameters Index Specifies the index. The index is from 0 (inclusive) to the total number of graphics in the list minus 1. You can get the number graphics in the list with M_NUMBER_OF_GRAPHICS. If the inquired value is not supported on the graphic specified, an error is generated. M_GRAPHIC_LABEL( MIL_INT Label ) Specifies the label of an existing graphic about which to inquire. Parameters Label Specifies the label. The label must be greater than 0. You can get the label of the last graphic added to the list with M_LAST_LABEL. If the inquired value is not supported on the graphic specified, an error is generated. M_LIST Inquires information about the 2D graphics list itself. SubIndex Specifies the index of the sub-element of the graphic about which to inquire. If this information is not required or supported, set this parameter to M_DEFAULT. For specifying the index of a graphic's sub-element Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies to inquire about the graphic itself (instead of just a sub-element). 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= M_NUMBER_OF_SUB_ELEMENTS Specifies the index of the sub-element of the graphic about which to inquire. The following table lists all the graphics for which you can inquire information about their individual sub-elements and outlines how sub-indices are assigned for each of these. Graphics types Index of sub-element values Dots (created using MgraDots()). The indices, starting from 0, are assigned to each dot in order of creation. A single line (created using MgraLine() or user-defined using MgraInteractive() set to M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_LINE). 0 is assigned to the specified start point, and 1 is assigned to the specified end point of the line. Sets of finite length lines (created using MgraLines() with M_LINE_LIST). The indices, starting from 0, are assigned to the specified start point and end point of each line, in order of creation. For example, the start point of the first line has an index of 0 and the end point has an index of 1, and the start point of the second line has an index of 2 and the end point has an index of 3. Sets of infinite lines (created using MgraLines() with M_INFINITE_LINES). The indices, starting from 0, are assigned to the first and second specified point of each line, in order of creation. For example, the first specified point of the first line has an index of 0 and its second specified point has an index of 1, and the first specified point of the second line has an index of 2 and its second specified point has an index of 3. A polygon (created using MgraLines() with M_POLYGON or user-defined using MgraInteractive() set to M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_POLYGON). The indices, starting from 0, are assigned to each polygon vertex in order of creation. A polyline (created using MgraLines() with M_POLYLINE or user-defined using MgraInteractive() set to M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_POLYLINE). The indices, starting from 0, are assigned to each polyline point in order of creation. InquireType Specifies the setting to inquire. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. UserVarPtr Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): MIL_DOUBLE MIL_ID MIL_INT MIL_INT32 MIL_INT64 Specifies the address in which to write the requested information. Since the MgraInquireList() function also returns the requested information, you can set this parameter to M_NULL. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be returned. Parameter associations The tables below list possible values for the InquireType parameter and possible values returned to the UserVarPtr parameter. For inquiring about a setting of a 2D graphics list itself For inquiring about a general graphic setting For inquiring about a setting related to interactivity For inquiring about a setting specific to text For inquiring about a setting regarding the position and dimensional information of a graphic For inquiring about general keyboard key settings to interactively modify graphics For inquiring about explicit keyboard keys to interactively modify graphics To inquire about a setting of a 2D graphics list, the InquireType parameter should be set to one of the following values.

M_LAST_LABEL Inquires the label that was automatically assigned to the last graphic added to the list in the current thread. This label value will never change, even if the order of the graphics in the list changes. After adding a graphic to the 2D graphics list, you should use this inquire type to establish the label assigned to it. This label can be used as a means of identifying the graphic independently from its index, which might change if a graphic is deleted from the list. You cannot retrieve the label value of the last added graphic if it has been deleted or moved to another 2D graphics list. If a graphic was added to the list from a different thread, the value returned will be that of the last graphic added to the list from the current thread; it will not return the label value of graphics added from a separate thread. This can be problematic when using MgraInteractive() to add graphics to the list interactively, since the graphics might be added from a separate thread. In this case, use MgraGetHookInfo() with M_GRAPHIC_LABEL_VALUE. See the Creating and modifying graphics interactively section of Chapter 26: Generating graphics for an example of how to inquire the label of a graphic added interactively.

Syntax void MgraInteractive( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextGraId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;ListGraId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;GraphicType, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;InitFlag, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;CreationMode //in ) Description This function changes the state of interactivity (M_INTERACTIVE_GRAPHIC_STATE) of graphics in a 2D graphics list. It is primarily used to change the state of interactivity of the graphics such that a user can interactively add a graphic of the specified type to the 2D graphics list (M_STATE_WAITING_FOR_CREATION). In addition, the function can end any interactive manipulations occurring in the display and return to an idle state (M_STATE_IDLE). When in the waiting for creation state (GraphicType set to an M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_... value), the user is expected to define a graphic interactively in the display. Note, however, that MgraInteractive() is asynchronous and only changes the state of interactivity; it will not wait for the user to define the graphic. You should have your application wait for the user to finish defining the graphic, before calling further functions; to do so, hook a function to the change in state of interactivity using MgraHookFunction() with M_INTERACTIVE_GRAPHIC_STATE_MODIFIED. When the user begins defining the graphic, the state of interactivity of the 2D graphics list (MgraInquireList() or MgraGetHookInfo() with M_INTERACTIVE_GRAPHIC_STATE) changes to M_STATE_BEING_CREATED. After a user has defined the graphic interactively, the state of interactivity returns to M_STATE_IDLE and you can continue your application from that moment. This function is especially useful if your application uses toolbars for a graphical user interface. For example, you can use another API to create a toolbar, with one of its buttons calling MgraInteractive() with M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_RECT. After clicking on the toolbar button, the user can define a rectangle in the display to specify where to perform processing or analysis in the image. Unlike most other functions that modify a MIL object, you can call this function concurrently from multiple threads on the same MIL 2D graphics list (ListGraId) without using an M_MUTEX object, as long as all the other parameters of the concurrent calls do not also share data. For more information, see Chapter 26: Generating graphics. Parameters Parameters ContextGraId Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics context. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For specifying the 2D graphics context Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies to use the default 2D graphics context of the current MIL application context. Note that there is a different default 2D graphics context for each thread. M_NULL Specifies a 2D graphics context is not necessary; you should use this setting only when GraphicType is set to M_CANCEL or M_STOP. MIL 2D graphics context identifier Specifies a valid 2D graphics context identifier, which you have allocated using MgraAlloc(). ListGraId Specifies the identifier of a valid 2D graphics list whose state of interactivity must be changed. You must have allocated the 2D graphics list using MgraAllocList(). GraphicType Specifies the type of graphic to define interactively and add to the 2D graphics list, or specifies to cancel or stop the 2D graphics list's state of interactivity. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. InitFlag Specifies optional behavior when defining the graphic in the display. If this behavior is not required or supported, set this parameter to M_DEFAULT. This parameter can be set to one or a combination of the following values. If the value is not supported for the graphic you are defining, MIL generates an error. For specifying optional behavior when defining the graphic Value Description M_FILLED Specifies that the graphic is filled (MgraControlList() with M_FILLED set to M_TRUE). This setting only applies to arcs (M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_ARC), polygons (M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_POLYGON), and rectangles (M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_RECT). M_ROTATE_AROUND_CORNER Specifies that the rectangle's position is set to its corner (MgraControlList() with M_POSITION_TYPE set to M_CORNER_AND_DIMENSION). If not specified, the rectangle's position is set to its center by default. This setting only applies to rectangles (M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_RECT). M_SECTOR Specifies that the arc is drawn as a sector (MgraControlList() with M_ARC_STYLE set to M_SECTOR). This setting only applies to arcs (M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_ARC). M_SQUARE_ASPECT_RATIO Specifies that the graphic has a 1:1 (square) aspect ratio (MgraControlList() with M_CONSTRAIN_ASPECT_RATIO set to 1.0). This setting only applies to arcs (M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_ARC) and rectangles (M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_RECT) that are not oriented (M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_RECT with M_ORIENTED_RECT). CreationMode Specifies how to interactively define the graphic. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Parameter associations The tables below list possible values for the GraphicType and CreationMode parameters. For defining the graphic interactively For ending user interaction The following GraphicType and corresponding CreationMode parameter settings let you define the graphic interactively. Specifically, the following values change the 2D graphics list's state of interactivity (MgraInquireList() with M_INTERACTIVE_GRAPHIC_STATE) to M_STATE_WAITING_FOR_CREATION, allowing you to add a graphic to the 2D graphics list by defining the graphic interactively in the display. For defining the graphic interactively GraphicType Description CreationMode M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_ARC Adds an arc to the 2D graphics list by defining the arc interactively in the display. In addition to defining an arc, you can use this value to define a circle or an ellipse (which are extensions of the arc mechanism). M_DEFAULT Specifies the legacy default behavior; instead of M_DEFAULT, MIL recommends using M_AXIS_ALIGNED_ELLIPSE. Do not specify M_DEFAULT unless required for backward compatibility. M_DEFAULT ignores 2D graphics list settings (MgraControlList()) related to whether resizing is with respect to the center (M_FIXED_CENTER) or the corner (M_FIXED_CORNER) of the selection box. M_DEFAULT requires you to click on the ellipse center in the display, and drag both ellipse radii with the mouse (this can be considered a legacy version of an axis-aligned ellipse). MIL adds the ellipse to the 2D graphics list on the first mouse-down event. M_ARC_THREE_POINTS Specifies to define a circular arc. This requires three clicks in the display. The first and third clicks determine the arc's start angle and end angle (not necessarily in this order); the second click establishes the position of the arc. MIL adds the arc to the 2D graphics list on the first mouse-move event after the second mouse-up event. MIL does not allow the three clicks to form a straight line. M_AXIS_ALIGNED_ELLIPSE Specifies to define an axis-aligned ellipse. This requires you to click on one corner of the ellipse bounding box in the display, and then drag the mouse to the opposite corner. MIL adds the ellipse to the 2D graphics list on the first mouse-down event. Instead of defining a corner of the ellipse bounding box, the first click can define the ellipse center. This can be the default behavior (MgraControlList() with M_MODE_RESIZE set to M_FIXED_CENTER), or the behavior when resizing while pressing the Alt (M_MODE_RESIZE_ALT), Ctrl (M_MODE_RESIZE_CTRL), or Shift (M_MODE_RESIZE_SHIFT) key. You can use M_AXIS_ALIGNED_ELLIPSE to define a circle (which is a special type of ellipse), by setting the InitFlag parameter to M_SQUARE_ASPECT_RATIO. You can also call MgraControlList() with M_SQUARE_ASPECT_RATIO as a combination value for M_MODE_RESIZE to specify this as the default behavior, or the behavior when pressing the Alt (M_MODE_RESIZE_ALT), Ctrl (M_MODE_RESIZE_CTRL), or Shift (M_MODE_RESIZE_SHIFT) key. M_CIRCLE Specifies to define a circle. This requires you to click on a point on the circle's circumference in the display, and then drag the mouse to the diametrically opposite point. MIL adds the circle to the 2D graphics list on the first mouse-down event. Instead of defining a point on the circle's circumference, the first click can define the circle's center. This can be the default behavior (MgraControlList() with M_MODE_RESIZE set to M_FIXED_CENTER), or the behavior when resizing while pressing the Alt (M_MODE_RESIZE_ALT), Ctrl (M_MODE_RESIZE_CTRL), or Shift (M_MODE_RESIZE_SHIFT) key. M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_DOT Adds a dot to the 2D graphics list by defining the dot interactively in the display. M_DEFAULT Specifies to define a dot. This requires you to click on the position in the display at which to place the dot. MIL adds the dot to the 2D graphics list on the mouse-down event. M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_LINE Adds a line to the 2D graphics list by defining the line interactively in the display. M_DEFAULT Specifies to define a line. This requires you to click on the line's start point in the display, and then drag the mouse to the line's end point. MIL adds the line to the 2D graphics list on the first mouse-down event. Instead of defining the line's start point, the first click can define the line's center. This can be the default behavior (MgraControlList() with M_MODE_RESIZE set to M_FIXED_CENTER, or the behavior when resizing while pressing the Alt (M_MODE_RESIZE_ALT), Ctrl (M_MODE_RESIZE_CTRL), or Shift (M_MODE_RESIZE_SHIFT) key. When creating the line, its end point can be seen as its angle of rotation. You can use MgraControlList() to specify the default rotation (orientation) behavior (M_MODE_ROTATE), or the rotation (orientation) behavior while pressing the Alt (M_MODE_ROTATE_ALT), Ctrl (M_MODE_ROTATE_CTRL), or Shift (M_MODE_ROTATE_SHIFT) key. M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_POLYGON Adds a polygon to the 2D graphics list by defining the polygon interactively in the display. M_DEFAULT Specifies to define a polygon. This requires you to left-click each polygon vertex in the display, except for the last vertex, which you must define with a right-click. MIL adds the polygon to the 2D graphics list on the first mouse-down event. By default, creating a polygon while pressing the Alt key snaps the next polygon segment to 15° angles. You can call MgraControlList() with M_MODE_ROTATE... to change this behavior. M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_POLYLINE Adds a polyline to the 2D graphics list by defining the polyline interactively in the display. M_DEFAULT Specifies to define a polyline. This requires you to left-click each polyline vertex in the display, except for the last vertex, which you must define with a right-click. MIL adds the polyline to the 2D graphics list on the first mouse-down event. By default, creating a polyline while pressing the Alt key snaps the next polyline segment to 15° angles. You can call MgraControlList() with M_MODE_ROTATE... to change this behavior. M_GRAPHIC_TYPE_RECT Adds a rectangle to the 2D graphics list by defining the rectangle interactively in the display. By default, you define the rectangle according to its center. This default behavior is established using MgraControlList() with M_POSITION_TYPE set to M_CENTER_AND_DIMENSION. To define the rectangle according to its top-left corner, set the InitFlag parameter (MgraInteractive()) to M_ROTATE_AROUND_CORNER. This is equivalent to setting M_POSITION_TYPE to M_CORNER_AND_DIMENSION. M_DEFAULT Specifies the legacy default behavior; instead of M_DEFAULT, MIL recommends using M_AXIS_ALIGNED_RECT. Do not specify M_DEFAULT unless required for backward compatibility. M_DEFAULT ignores 2D graphics list settings (MgraControlList()) related to whether resizing is with respect to the center (M_FIXED_CENTER) or the corner (M_FIXED_CORNER) of the selection box. You also cannot use M_DEFAULT with M_ROTATE_AROUND_CORNER. M_DEFAULT requires you to click on a rectangle corner in the display, and then drag the mouse to the opposite corner (this can be considered a legacy version of an axis-aligned rectangle). MIL adds the rectangle to the 2D graphics list on the first mouse-down event. M_AXIS_ALIGNED_RECT Specifies to define an axis-aligned rectangle. This requires you to click on a rectangle corner in the display, and then drag the mouse to the opposite corner. MIL adds the rectangle to the 2D graphics list on the first mouse-down event. Instead of defining a rectangle corner, the first click can define the rectangle center. This can be the default behavior (MgraControlList() with M_MODE_RESIZE set to M_FIXED_CENTER), or the behavior when resizing while pressing the Alt (M_MODE_RESIZE_ALT), Ctrl (M_MODE_RESIZE_CTRL), or Shift (M_MODE_RESIZE_SHIFT) key. You can use M_AXIS_ALIGNED_RECT to define a square (which is a special type of rectangle), by setting the InitFlag parameter to M_SQUARE_ASPECT_RATIO. You can also call MgraControlList() with M_SQUARE_ASPECT_RATIO as a combination value for M_MODE_RESIZE to specify this as the default behavior, or the behavior when pressing the Alt (M_MODE_RESIZE_ALT), Ctrl (M_MODE_RESIZE_CTRL), or Shift (M_MODE_RESIZE_SHIFT) key. M_ORIENTED_RECT Specifies to define an oriented rectangle. This requires three clicks in the display. By default, the first click defines a fixed corner of the rectangle, the second click defines its width (a line extending to the fixed corner), and the third click defines its height on one side of the width line. MIL adds the rectangle to the 2D graphics list on the first mouse-up event. Instead of defining the rectangle's width using a fixed corner, the first two clicks can define the width symmetrically on both sides of a center point; that is, the first click represents the fixed center of the width line, and the second click extends the width line equally on both sides of the fixed center. This can be the default behavior (MgraControlList() with M_MODE_RESIZE set to M_FIXED_CENTER), or the behavior when pressing the Alt (M_MODE_RESIZE_ALT), Ctrl (M_MODE_RESIZE_CTRL), or Shift (M_MODE_RESIZE_SHIFT) key. Instead of defining the rectangle's height on one side of the width line, the third click can define the height symmetrically on both sides; that is, moving your mouse above or below the width line (established by the first two clicks) adjusts the height equally on the other side until the third click. This can be the default behavior (MgraControlList() with M_MODE_RESIZE_SECONDARY_DIMENSION), or the behavior when pressing the Alt (M_MODE_RESIZE_SECONDARY_DIMENSION_ALT), Ctrl (M_MODE_RESIZE_SECONDARY_DIMENSION_CTRL), or Shift (M_MODE_RESIZE_SECONDARY_DIMENSION_SHIFT) key. You can use M_ORIENTED_RECT to define a square (which is special type of rectangle), by setting the InitFlag parameter to M_SQUARE_ASPECT_RATIO. You can also call MgraControlList() with M_SQUARE_ASPECT_RATIO as a combination value for M_MODE_RESIZE to specify this as the default behavior, or the behavior when pressing the Alt (M_MODE_RESIZE_ALT), Ctrl (M_MODE_RESIZE_CTRL), or Shift (M_MODE_RESIZE_SHIFT) key. The following GraphicType and corresponding CreationMode parameter settings change the 2D graphics list's state of interactivity to idle (M_STATE_IDLE) and will cancel or stop any user manipulations in progress. For ending user interaction GraphicType Description CreationMode M_CANCEL Changes the 2D graphics list's state of interactivity to idle (M_STATE_IDLE) and cancels any user manipulations in progress. A cancel operation will stop any user manipulation in progress and undo any changes that occurred. If, for example, a user was rotating a graphic with the rotate handle, canceling will stop the user from rotating it further and return the graphic to the angle it was set to before the user started manipulating it. If a user is interactively defining a graphic to add to the 2D graphics list, canceling will stop the defining process and not add any graphic to the list. M_DEFAULT Specifies that this parameter is not required. M_STOP Changes the 2D graphics list's state of interactivity to idle (M_STATE_IDLE) and stops any user manipulations in progress. A stop operation ends any user manipulations in progress and leaves any changes made to the graphic. If, for example, a user was rotating a graphic with the rotate handle, stopping will prevent the user from rotating it further and leave the graphic at that angle. If a user is interactively defining a graphic to add to the 2D graphics list, stopping will prevent the user from defining it further and adds the graphic to the list with the current dimensions. M_DEFAULT Specifies to ignore this parameter is not required. Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib. DLL Requires mil.dll.

Syntax void MgraLine( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextGraId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufOrListGraId, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;XStart, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;YStart, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;XEnd, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;YEnd //in ) Description This function draws a line destructively (raster-based) in the specified image. Alternatively, this function can add a vector-based version of the line to the specified 2D graphics list, allowing you to, for example, non-destructively annotate a display without pixelation effects upon scaling. The line is based on a start point (XStart, YStart) and an end point (XEnd, YEnd). The line inherits all the relevant settings of the specified 2D graphics context, such as the foreground color (see MgraAlloc() for default context settings). If part of the line falls outside of the specified area (image or display), that part is clipped off. To modify or inquire 2D graphics context settings, use MgraControl() or MgraInquire(). To modify or inquire 2D graphics list settings, use MgraControlList() or MgraInquireList(). A line's coordinates are interpreted with respect to the input coordinate system, specified using MgraControl() or MgraControlList() with M_INPUT_UNITS. Note that if you set your input coordinate system to M_WORLD and you pass MgraLine() an uncalibrated image, the function will generate an error. To create multiple lines, a polyline, or a polygon, use MgraLines(). Unlike most other functions that modify a MIL object, you can call this function concurrently from multiple threads on the same MIL 2D graphics list (DstImageBufOrListGraId) without using an M_MUTEX object, as long as all the other parameters of the concurrent calls do not also share data. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler) in 64-bit mode, MgraLine() internally calls the MIL_DOUBLE version of this function (MgraLineDouble()). If you need to pass large integer values (including pointers), call the MIL_INT64 version of this function (MgraLineInt64()). Parameters Parameters ContextGraId Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics context. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For specifying the 2D graphics context Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the default 2D graphics context of the current MIL application is used. Note that there is a different default 2D graphics context for each thread. MIL 2D graphics context identifier Specifies a valid 2D graphics context identifier, which you have allocated using MgraAlloc(). DstImageBufOrListGraId Specifies the identifier of a valid image buffer in which to draw the line or the identifier of a valid 2D graphics list in which to add the line. You must have allocated the image buffer or the 2D graphics list using MbufAlloc...() or MgraAllocList(), respectively. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. XStart Specifies the X-coordinate of the start of the line in the input coordinate system. YStart Specifies the Y-coordinate of the start of the line in the input coordinate system. XEnd Specifies the X-coordinate of the end of the line in the input coordinate system. YEnd Specifies the Y-coordinate of the end of the line in the input coordinate system.

Alternatively, this function can add a vector-based version of the lines, polyline, or polygon to the specified 2D graphics list, allowing you to, for example, non-destructively annotate a display without pixelation effects upon scaling. Lines, polylines, and polygons inherit all the relevant settings of the specified 2D graphics context, such as the foreground color. If part of a line, polyline, or polygon falls outside of the destination image (or, when drawn in a 2D graphics list, the associated display), that part is clipped off. To modify or inquire 2D graphics context settings, use MgraControl() or MgraInquire(), respectively. To modify or inquire 2D graphics list settings, use MgraControlList() or MgraInquireList(), respectively. The coordinates of the lines, polyline, or polygon are interpreted with respect to the input coordinate system, specified using MgraControl() or MgraControlList() with M_INPUT_UNITS. Note that if you set your input coordinate system to M_WORLD and you pass MgraLines() an uncalibrated image, the function will generate an error. To create a single line without the option of creating multiple lines, a polyline, or a polygon, use MgraLine(). Note that prior to MIL 9.0, this function only supported integer positions; the XPtr, YPtr, X2Ptr, and Y2Ptr parameters only accepted arrays of type long. As of MIL 9.0, this function includes support for positions with floating-point precision. To implement this change and maintain backwards compatibility when using a C++ compiler (*.cpp), MgraLines() is available as an inline function which automatically calls MgraLinesDouble(), MgraLinesInt64(), and MgraLinesInt32(), depending on whether XPtr, YPtr, X2Ptr, and Y2Ptr receive arrays of type MIL_DOUBLE, MIL_INT64, or MIL_INT32, respectively. To maintain backwards compatibility when using a C compiler (*.c), MgraLines() maps to MgraLinesInt32() when working on a 32-bit system, or MgraLinesInt64() when working on a 64-bit system; you must explicitly call MgraLinesDouble() to pass XPtr, YPtr, X2Ptr, and Y2Ptr arrays of type MIL_DOUBLE, respectively. If you are an advanced user and want to retrieve a pointer to MgraLines(), you must use the Double, Int64, or Int32 version of this function, since MgraLines() is actually a macro or an overloaded function. Unlike most other functions that modify a MIL object, you can call this function concurrently from multiple threads on the same MIL 2D graphics list (DstImageBufOrListGraId) without using an M_MUTEX object, as long as all the other parameters of the concurrent calls do not also share data. Note that presented above is an example prototype of this function. You can call MgraLines() with the same prototype as any of the type-specific functions below, without using the function's type-specific name; that is, use MgraLines() and not, for example, MgraLinesInt32(). MIL automatically casts the data into the appropriate type. This is true except when using a C compiler. When using a C compiler, you must always call this function with its type-specific name (you cannot use the standard name of this function). Parameters Parameters ContextGraId Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics context. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For specifying the 2D graphics context Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the default 2D graphics context of the current MIL application is used. Note that there is a different default 2D graphics context for each thread. MIL 2D graphics context identifier Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics context, which you have allocated using MgraAlloc(). DstImageBufOrListGraId Specifies the identifier of a valid image buffer in which to draw the lines, polyline, or polygon or the identifier of a valid 2D graphics list in which to add the lines, polyline, or polygon. You must have allocated the image buffer or the 2D graphics list using MbufAlloc...() or MgraAllocList(), respectively. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. NumberOfLinesOrVertices Specifies the number of lines to draw or add (M_LINE_LIST), or the number of vertices in the polyline or polygon to draw or add (M_POLYGON or M_POLYLINE), according to the array parameters (XPtr, YPtr, X2Ptr, and Y2Ptr). When using a standard vector (std::vector) overload function in C++, you can pass M_DEFAULT to this parameter and MIL will automatically determine the size based on the number of items in the vector passed to the XPtr, YPtr, X2Ptr, or Y2Ptr parameter. XPtr Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] Specifies the address of the array containing the X-coordinate(s) of the start of the lines, or containing the X-coordinates of the vertices in the polyline or polygon, in the input coordinate system. The number of elements in the array should be equal to the NumberOfLinesOrVertices parameter value. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. YPtr Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] Specifies the address of the array containing the Y-coordinate(s) of the start of the lines, or containing the Y-coordinates of the vertices in the polyline or polygon, in the input coordinate system. The number of elements in the array should be equal to the NumberOfLinesOrVertices parameter value. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. X2Ptr Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] M_NULL Specifies the address of the array containing the X-coordinate(s) of the end of the lines in the input coordinate system. The number of elements in the array should be equal to the NumberOfLinesOrVertices parameter value. If this information is not required (M_POLYGON and M_POLYLINE), set this parameter to M_NULL. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Y2Ptr Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] M_NULL Specifies the address of the array containing the Y-coordinate(s) of the end of the lines in the input coordinate system. The number of elements in the array should be equal to the NumberOfLinesOrVertices parameter value. If this information is not required (M_POLYGON and M_POLYLINE), set this parameter to M_NULL. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ControlFlag Specifies the type of line to draw in the image or to add to the 2D graphics list. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Parameter associations The table below lists possible values for the XPtr, YPtr, X2Ptr, Y2Ptr, and ControlFlag parameters. For specifying the type of line Note that any unused parameters should be set to M_NULL. For specifying the type of line ControlFlag Description XPtr YPtr X2Ptr Y2Ptr M_DEFAULT Same as M_LINE_LIST. XPtr YPtr X2Ptr Y2Ptr M_INFINITE_LINES Specifies a series of infinite lines, each with no start or end points. Each line is defined by two points ((XPtr, YPtr) and (X2Ptr, Y2Ptr)), but the line extends beyond these points. XPtr Specifies the address of the array containing the X-coordinate(s) of the first point used to define a line. YPtr Specifies the address of the array containing the Y-coordinate(s) of the first point used to define a line. X2Ptr Specifies the address of the array containing the X-coordinate(s) of the second point used to define a line. Y2Ptr Specifies the address of the array containing the Y-coordinate(s) of the second point used to define a line. M_LINE_LIST Specifies a series of lines of finite length. Each line is defined with two points ((XPtr, YPtr) and (X2Ptr, Y2Ptr)). XPtr Specifies the address of the array containing the X-coordinate(s) of the first point used to define a line. YPtr Specifies the address of the array containing the Y-coordinate(s) of the first point used to define a line. X2Ptr Specifies the address of the array containing the X-coordinate(s) of the second point used to define a line. Y2Ptr Specifies the address of the array containing the Y-coordinate(s) of the second point used to define a line. M_POLYGON Specifies a series of connected lines forming a closed polygon. The polygon is defined with two or more vertices (XPtr, YPtr). The final vertex is connected to the first. XPtr Specifies the address of the array containing the X-coordinates of the vertices used to define the polygon. YPtr Specifies the address of the array containing the Y-coordinates of the vertices used to define the polygon. X2Ptr This parameter must be set to M_NULL. Y2Ptr This parameter must be set to M_NULL. M_POLYLINE Specifies a series of connected lines forming an open polyline. The polyline is defined with two or more vertices (XPtr, YPtr). The final vertex is not connected to the first. Since the final vertex is not connected to the first, the number of line segments in the polyline is equal to NumberOfLinesOrVertices - 1.

Alternatively, this function can add a vector-based version of a rectangle to the specified 2D graphics list, allowing you to, for example, non-destructively annotate a display without pixelation effects upon scaling. The rectangle is created from the top-left corner (XStart, YStart) to the bottom-right corner (XEnd, YEnd). The rectangle inherits all the relevant settings of the specified 2D graphics context, such as the foreground color (see MgraAlloc() for default context settings). If part of the rectangle falls outside of the specified area (image or display), that part is clipped off. To modify or inquire 2D graphics context settings, use MgraControl() or MgraInquire(). To modify or inquire 2D graphics list settings, use MgraControlList() or MgraInquireList(). A rectangle's coordinates are interpreted with respect to the input coordinate system, specified using MgraControl() or MgraControlList() with M_INPUT_UNITS. Note that if you set your input coordinate system to M_WORLD and you pass MgraRect() an uncalibrated image, the function will generate an error. To create a filled rectangle, use MgraRectFill(). To create a rectangle that can be optionally filled and rotated, use MgraRectAngle(). Unlike most other functions that modify a MIL object, you can call this function concurrently from multiple threads on the same MIL 2D graphics list (DstImageBufOrListGraId) without using an M_MUTEX object, as long as all the other parameters of the concurrent calls do not also share data. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler) in 64-bit mode, MgraRect() internally calls the MIL_DOUBLE version of this function (MgraRectDouble()). If you need to pass large integer values (including pointers), call the MIL_INT64 version of this function (MgraRectInt64()). Parameters Parameters ContextGraId Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics context. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For specifying the 2D graphics context Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the default 2D graphics context of the current MIL application is used. Note that there is a different default 2D graphics context for each thread. MIL 2D graphics context identifier Specifies a valid 2D graphics context identifier, which you have allocated using MgraAlloc(). DstImageBufOrListGraId Specifies the identifier of a valid image buffer in which to draw the rectangle or the identifier of a valid 2D graphics list in which to add the rectangle. You must have allocated the image buffer or the 2D graphics list using MbufAlloc...() or MgraAllocList(), respectively. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. XStart Specifies the X-coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle in the input coordinate system. YStart Specifies the Y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle in the input coordinate system. XEnd Specifies the X-coordinate of the bottom-right corner of the rectangle in the input coordinate system.

Alternatively, this function can add a vector-based version of a rectangle to the specified 2D graphics list, allowing you to, for example, non-destructively annotate a display without pixelation effects upon scaling. The rectangle is created using a point (XPos, YPos), a width (Width), a height (Height), and an angle of rotation (Angle).

If part of the rectangle falls outside of the specified area (image or display), that part is clipped off. To modify or inquire 2D graphics context settings, use MgraControl() or MgraInquire(). To modify or inquire 2D graphics list settings, use MgraControlList() or MgraInquireList(). A rectangle's coordinates, dimensions, and angle are interpreted with respect to the input coordinate system, specified using MgraControl() or MgraControlList() with M_INPUT_UNITS. An angle interpreted with respect to the pixel coordinate system is always measured counter-clockwise. For information on the angle's direction of rotation when interpreting the angle with respect to the relative coordinate system, see the Angle convention in MIL subsection of the Working with real-world units section of Chapter 28: Calibrating your camera setup. Note that if you set your input coordinate system to M_WORLD and you pass MgraRectAngle() an uncalibrated image or the drawing target of the 2D graphics list is uncalibrated, the function will generate an error. To create a filled rectangle that is not rotated, use MgraRectFill(). To create a rectangle that is not rotated or filled, use MgraRect(). Unlike most other functions that modify a MIL object, you can call this function concurrently from multiple threads on the same MIL 2D graphics list (DestImageBufIdOrGraListId) without using an M_MUTEX object, as long as all the other parameters of the concurrent calls do not also share data.

DestImageBufIdOrGraListId Specifies the identifier of a valid image buffer in which to draw the rectangle or the identifier of a valid 2D graphics list in which to add the rectangle. You must have allocated the image buffer or the 2D graphics list using MbufAlloc...() or MgraAllocList(), respectively. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. XPos Specifies the X-coordinate of the rectangle's position in the input coordinate system. YPos Specifies the Y-coordinate of the rectangle's position in the input coordinate system. Width Specifies the width of the rectangle, relative to the input coordinate system. Height Specifies the height of the rectangle, relative to the input coordinate system. Angle Specifies the angle with which to rotate the rectangle, in degrees, relative to the input coordinate system. The rectangle will either be rotated around its center (when using M_CENTER_AND_DIMENSION) or its top-left corner (when using M_CORNER_AND_DIMENSION). ControlFlag Specifies how to draw the rectangle in the image or add the rectangle to the 2D graphics list. For specifying how to draw or add the rectangle Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_CORNER_AND_DIMENSION. M_CENTER_AND_DIMENSION Specifies that the rectangle is drawn according to its center position, as defined by the specified coordinates. Coordinates are set with the XPos and YPos parameters. M_CORNER_AND_DIMENSION Specifies that the rectangle is drawn according to the position of its top-left corner, as defined by the specified coordinates.

Alternatively, this function can add a vector-based version of the vectors to the specified 2D graphics list, allowing you to, for example, non-destructively annotate a display without pixelation effects upon scaling. To draw vectors at equally spaced positions, use MgraVectorsGrid(). The vectors are based on the specified starting positions (XArrayPtr and YArrayPtr), and the specified horizontal and vertical displacements (UArrayPtr and VArrayPtr).

MIL automatically casts the data into the appropriate type. This is true except when using a C compiler. When using a C compiler, you must always call this function with its type-specific name (you cannot use the standard name of this function). Parameters Parameters ContextGraId Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics context. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For the identifier of the 2D graphics context Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the default 2D graphics context of the current MIL application is used. Note that there is a different default 2D graphics context for each thread. MIL 2D graphics context identifier Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics context, which you have allocated using MgraAlloc(). DstImageBufOrListGraId Specifies the identifier of a valid image buffer in which to draw the vectors or the identifier of a valid 2D graphics list in which to add the vectors. You must have allocated the image buffer or the 2D graphics list using MbufAlloc...() or MgraAllocList(), respectively. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. NumVectors Specifies the number of vectors to draw. When using a standard vector (std::vector) overload function in C++, you can pass M_DEFAULT to this parameter and MIL will automatically determine the size based on the number of items in the vector passed to the XArrayPtr, YArrayPtr, UArrayPtr, or VArrayPtr parameter. XArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumVectors) Specifies the address of the array containing the X-coordinates of the starting points of the vectors to draw. The number of elements in the array should be equal to the value specified for the NumVectors parameter. YArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumVectors) Specifies the address of the array containing the Y-coordinates of the starting points of the vectors to draw. The number of elements in the array should be equal to the value specified for the NumVectors parameter. UArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumVectors) Specifies the address of the array containing the displacements, in the X-direction, of the vectors to draw. The number of elements in the array should be equal to the value specified for the NumVectors parameter. VArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumVectors) Specifies the address of the array containing the displacements, in the Y-direction, of the vectors to draw. The number of elements in the array should be equal to the value specified for the NumVectors parameter. ScaleMode Specifies how to use the scale value (ScaleValue) to scale the vectors. By default, vectors are not scaled. For specifying how to use the scale value to scale the vectors Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_ABSOLUTE. M_ABSOLUTE Specifies to use the scale value (ScaleValue) as a scaling factor that directly multiplies the vectors' horizontal and vertical displacements (UArrayPtr and VArrayPtr). M_AUTO Specifies that MIL determines the scale mode. To do this, MIL makes internal assumptions to establish an ideal scaling factor that optimizes the space taken by the vectors in the destination (DstImageBufOrListGraId) while reducing the chance of overlapping vectors. When using M_AUTO, MIL multiplies the vectors' horizontal and vertical displacements (UArrayPtr and VArrayPtr) by both the scale value (ScaleValue) and the internally established scale factor. ScaleValue Specifies the value by which to scale the vectors, according to the specified mode (ScaleMode). By default, vectors are not scaled. For specifying the value by which to scale the vectors, according to the specified mode Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value Specifies the scale value. ControlFlag Specifies how to configure the arrowheads of the vectors, and how to handle null vectors. For specifying how to configure the arrowheads of the vectors Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_FIXED_LENGTH_ARROWHEADS + M_SKIP_NULL_VECTORS. M_FIXED_LENGTH_ARROWHEADS Specifies that arrowheads are drawn identically for all vectors, regardless of each vector's length. M_PROPORTIONAL_ARROWHEADS Specifies that arrowheads are drawn proportionally to each vector's length. Combination values for M_FIXED_LENGTH_ARROWHEADS , M_PROPORTIONAL_ARROWHEADS. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to determine how to handle null vectors. Null vectors are vectors with a length of 0. This occurs when a vector's displacement values (UArrayPtr and VArrayPtr) are both 0. For determining how to handle null vectors Combination value Description M_DRAW_NULL_VECTORS Specifies that null vectors are drawn as a dot in the destination (DstImageBufOrListGraId). M_SKIP_NULL_VECTORS Specifies that null vectors are not drawn in the destination (DstImageBufOrListGraId).

Syntax void MgraVectorsGrid( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextGraId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufOrListGraId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;UImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;VImageBufId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;Stride, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ScaleMode, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;ScaleValue, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function draws vectors destructively (raster-based) in the specified image at equally spaced positions. Alternatively, this function can add a vector-based version of the vectors to the specified 2D graphics list, allowing you to, for example, non-destructively annotate a display without pixelation effects upon scaling. To draw vectors at arbitrary positions, use MgraVectors(). The vectors are based on the specified image buffers (UImageBufId and VImageBufId) containing values that correspond to the horizontal and vertical displacements of the vectors. MIL uses the displacements at a given location to calculate the starting and ending positions of the vectors. For example, the values located at (x, y) in the specified buffers (UImageBufId and VImageBufId) define a vector that goes from (x, y) to (x + u[x][y], y + v[x][y]). The number of pixels in the buffers (SizeX x SizeY) determine the number of vectors to draw. Typically, the image buffers from which the vectors' positions and lengths are inferred are the result of a previous image processing operation, such as an edge detection (for example, MimConvolve()). The vectors inherit all the relevant settings of the specified 2D graphics context, such as the foreground color (see MgraAlloc() for default context settings). If part of the vectors fall outside of the specified area (image or display), that part is clipped off. To modify or inquire 2D graphics context settings, use MgraControl() or MgraInquire(). To modify or inquire 2D graphics list settings, use MgraControlList() or MgraInquireList(). The starting coordinates of the first vector drawn are (0,0). Coordinates are interpreted with respect to the input coordinate system, specified using MgraControl() or MgraControlList() with M_INPUT_UNITS. Note that if you set your input coordinate system to M_WORLD and you pass MgraVectorsGrid() uncalibrated images, the function will generate an error. Unlike most other functions that modify a MIL object, you can call this function concurrently from multiple threads on the same MIL 2D graphics list (DstImageBufOrListGraId) without using an M_MUTEX object, as long as all the other parameters of the concurrent calls do not also share data. Parameters Parameters ContextGraId Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics context. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For the identifier of the 2D graphics context Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the default 2D graphics context of the current MIL application is used. Note that there is a different default 2D graphics context for each thread. MIL 2D graphics context identifier Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics context, which you have allocated using MgraAlloc(). DstImageBufOrListGraId Specifies the identifier of a valid image buffer in which to draw the vectors or the identifier of a valid 2D graphics list in which to add the vectors. You must have allocated the image buffer or the 2D graphics list using MbufAlloc...() or MgraAllocList(), respectively. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. UImageBufId Specifies the identifier of a valid image buffer containing the values corresponding to the displacements, in the X-direction, of the vectors to draw. You must have allocated the image buffer using MbufAlloc...(). This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. The image buffer must be a single-band buffer. VImageBufId Specifies the identifier of a valid image buffer containing the values corresponding to the displacements, in the Y-direction, of the vectors to draw. You must have allocated the image buffer using MbufAlloc...(). This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. The image buffer must be a single-band buffer. Stride Specifies a value that establishes the positions for which vectors are drawn. MIL always draws a vector for the first position (0,0), and then draws subsequent vectors that are a multiple of the specified stride, in both the X- and Y-direction. For example, if you specify a stride of 2, a vector is drawn for position (0,0), and for every second position after that, in the X-direction and in the Y-direction. Specifying a stride of 1 draws a vector for every position. Increasing the stride increases the space between the vectors drawn. ScaleMode Specifies how to use the scale value (ScaleValue) to scale the vectors. By default, vectors are not scaled. For specifying how to use the scale value to scale the vectors Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_ABSOLUTE. M_ABSOLUTE Specifies to use the scale value (ScaleValue) as a scaling factor that directly multiplies the vectors' horizontal and vertical displacements (UImageBufId and VImageBufId). M_AUTO Specifies that MIL determines the scale mode. To do this, MIL makes internal assumptions to establish an ideal scaling factor that optimizes the space taken by the vectors in the destination (DstImageBufOrListGraId) while reducing the chance of overlapping vectors. When using M_AUTO, MIL multiplies the vectors' horizontal and vertical displacements (UImageBufId and VImageBufId) by both the scale value (ScaleValue) and the internally established scale factor. ScaleValue Specifies the value by which to scale the vectors, according to the specified mode (ScaleMode). By default, vectors are not scaled. For specifying the value by which to scale the vectors, according to the specified mode Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value Specifies the scale value. ControlFlag Specifies how to configure the arrowheads of the vectors, and how to handle null vectors. For specifying how to configure the arrowheads of the vectors Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_FIXED_LENGTH_ARROWHEADS + M_SKIP_NULL_VECTORS. M_FIXED_LENGTH_ARROWHEADS Specifies that arrowheads are drawn identically for all vectors, regardless of each vector's length. M_PROPORTIONAL_ARROWHEADS Specifies that arrowheads are drawn proportionally to each vector's length. Combination values for M_FIXED_LENGTH_ARROWHEADS , M_PROPORTIONAL_ARROWHEADS. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to determine how to handle null vectors. Null vectors are vectors with a length of 0. This occurs when a vector's displacement values (UImageBufId and VImageBufId) are both 0.

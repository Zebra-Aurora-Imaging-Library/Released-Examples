M_INCLUDED_BLOBS in MblobGetResult. 3.2 Unsupported MIL functions The following is a list of known limitations, by MIL module: - Blob module: - MblobMerge and MblobReconstruct are not yet supported. - Blob post-calculation is not supported. - M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER regions are not supported. - Calibration module: - McalGrid M_DISPLACE_..._COORD is not yet supported. - 3D calibration operations are not yet supported. - McalTransformImage with M_USE_DESTINATION_CALIBRATION is not yet supported. - Measurement module: - Result statistics (M_MAX, M_MIN,...) are not yet supported. - Model Finder module: - Advanced model definitions (auto-define, from edge result, from model finder result, merged model) are not yet supported. - Model weighted mask are not yet supported. - Primitives: - The following primitives are not yet supported: - MimZoneOfInfluence, - MimWatershed, - MimWarp, - MimTransform, - MimPolarTransform, - MimLocateEvent, - MimLabel, - MimHistogramEqualize, - MimFindExtreme, - MimDistance, - MimCountDifference, - MimConnectMap, - MimArithMultiple, - McolProject, - McolDistance, - MbufBayer. 3.3 Utilities The following is a list of utilities included with MIL CoPilot: - 32-bit float buffers Line and Arc Profiles are not available on 32-bit buffer. - YUV buffers YUV buffers are not supported by the utilities: Line and Arc profiles, Histogram, etc 4. Known issues The following is a list of known issues with the product: - When using the Blob module, several unavailable feret feature columns may be filled with uninitialized data. For example, enabling the binary version of a feature (specifically, M_FERET_PRINCIPAL_AXIS_ELONGATION, M_FERET_AT_PRINCIPAL_AXIS_ANGLE, M_FERET_AT_SECONDARY_AXIS_ANGLE) will result in erroneous columns filled for the equivalent grayscale feret features. - The the &quot;Compare Images&quot; tool only works with image buffers. If you don't specify images buffers, MIL CoPilot will abruptly terminate. ",

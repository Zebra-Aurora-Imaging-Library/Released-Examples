It also presents last minute information that did not make it into the manual or on-line help. Note that this text file serves to complement your manual. The information found in this file overrides your formally documented material. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Main Table of Contents Section 1: What's new in MIL 10.0 Processing Pack 1 Section 2: What's new in MIL 10.0 Update 14 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Section 1: What's new in MIL 10.0 Processing Pack 1 Table of Contents for Section 1 1. New functionalities and improvements 1.1 Memory traces 1.2 Miscellaneous 2. Fixed bugs 3. Location of examples (in the help file) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. New functionalities and improvements 1.1 Memory traces - Matrox Profiler now supports trace generation in a circular memory buffer. The buffer can be located in shared memory or in non-paged memory (if available). - The size of this buffer can be adjusted from the trace generation dialog. - Multiple buffers can be created in the trace generation dialog to allow tracing multiple applications. - Matrox Profiler can load and display the current snapshot of the buffer while the application is tracing. 1.2 Miscellaneous - Double-clicking on an event in a list in the Profiler now zooms on the event in addition to recentering on the event. - Matrox Profiler can now search for memory traces inside memory dump files (.dmp). - Improved conversion of several numerical values of MIL function parameters into their constant names. - The folder used by MIL to generate trace files has been replaced by a folder with less access restriction, allowing services running under a different user to generate traces. - The trace loading dialog now supports file deletion. - The statistics pane now supports exporting statistic results. 2. Fixed bugs - Matrox Profiler will no longer incorrectly handle character arrays in ascii and unicode. - The location of a bookmark created from a high zoom factor will no longer be inaccurate. - Matrox Profiler no longer freezes when closing a trace after having tried to generate statistics on the selected element while having no element selected. - Combining application and thread level activation or deactivation of the trace log no longer leads to incoherent results when visualized with Matrox Profiler. 3. Location of examples (in the help file) - In the help file, the location information written at the top of examples might not be up-to-date. Use MIL Example Launcher to find an example on disk. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Section 2: What's new in MIL 10.0 Update 14 Table of Contents for Section 2 1. New functionalities and improvements 1.1 Statistics 1.2 MIL constants conversion 1.3 Improved trace loading 1.4 Sessions 1.5 MIL_ID information 1.6 Bookmarks 1.7 Miscellaneous 2. Fixed bugs 3. Known limitations 4. Matrox Design Assistant support ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. New functionalities and improvements 1.1 Statistics - Matrox Profiler now provides statistical information relative to the execution times of operations. The statistics tab in the right pane provides information such as the min, max, total, and average execution time. The operations, that can be selected and highlighted in the timeline, are grouped by category. 1.2 MIL constants conversion - Matrox Profiler now converts the numerical values of MIL function parameters into their definition names. This feature can be deactivated from the options dialog. 1.3 Improved trace loading - When opening a trace, a window allows you to modify the section of the file to load. By default, the size of the section is automatically adjusted to accommodate the available memory. This window is accessible from the menu, under File &gt; Load Other Section. - Trace generation now displays a window that lists the currently available trace files. This list is updated automatically as traces are created. 1.4 Sessions - Next to the trace files, Matrox Profiler creates &quot;.profiler&quot; files, which contain various information related to the current session such as the bookmarks, the section of the file loaded into memory, the search results, and the search filters. - A session file is automatically loaded when the user re-opens a trace. 1.5 MIL_ID information - MIL_IDs are now displayed as hyperlinks in the trace detail section at the bottom of Matrox Profiler. When clicked, a popup containing the most probable allocation and free operations for the ID is displayed. - From this popup, you can also jump to the previous or next occurrence of the ID. 1.6 Bookmarks - Markers have been renamed to &quot;Bookmarks&quot; and are listed in a separate tab in the Quick Access side bar. - The measuring tool (Measure From and Measure To) can now be attached to a bookmark and is accessible from the Bookmark contextual menu. - The bookmarks can also be renamed from the Bookmark contextual menu. 1.7 Miscellaneous - Holding SHIFT while zooming with the mouse wheel zooms faster. - Search results have a contextual menu (Copy). - Initially loaded DLLs are shown in the Trace Information window even with a partially loaded trace. - Used license packages are displayed in the Trace Information window if MappFree() is contained in the loaded section of the trace. - The trace overview section, shown at the bottom of the Matrox Profiler window, supports more intuitive mouse controls. For example, Ctrl+Click draws a region, and you can resize the viewport region by grabbing and moving the region's edges. - Threads can be resized vertically by dragging the gripper at the bottom of the thread header. - Timestamps can be displayed in seconds instead of milliseconds. - Matrox Profiler settings can be reset to default from the new Options dialog box. 2. Fixed bugs - Matrox Profiler no longer freezes when applying a high zooming factor near a bookmark. - Matrox Profiler no longer freezes when applying a high zooming factor while using the navigation features 'Goto next/previous'. - A file that ends with a lot of corrupted data can be correctly parsed. - Matrox Profiler no longer crashes when trying to copy information to the clipboard while the latter is locked by another application. - Child windows now appear in the same screen as the main window. - Fixed crash when displaying a very small trace in the Text Trace window. - The location of a bookmark created from the ruler contextual menu will no longer be inaccurate. - Small events separated by large gaps will no longer be combined into a single block. - Search results will no longer be missing some elements in large searches. - Zooming with a region just after panning no longer causes an incorrect zoom. 3. Known limitations - Combining application and thread level activation or deactivation of the trace log can lead to incoherent results when visualized with Matrox Profiler. - Several numerical values of the MIL function parameters are not correctly converted into their definition names. 4. Matrox Design Assistant support - Added support for Matrox Design Assistant traces. The traces include information about features such as loops, steps, flowcharts, filmstrips, operator views, and errors. ",

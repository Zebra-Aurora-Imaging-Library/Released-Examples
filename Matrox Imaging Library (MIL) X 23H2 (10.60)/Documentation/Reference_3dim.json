Syntax void M3dimArith( MIL_ID&nbsp;Src1ImageBufOrGeometry3dgeoId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;Src2ImageBufOrGeometry3dgeoId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;MaskBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Operation, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;SignMode, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function performs the specified point-to-point arithmetic operation on two depth maps or one depth map and one 3D geometry, storing the resulting depth map in the specified destination container or image buffer. Note that M3dimArith() cannot be called with two 3D geometry operands. Alternatively, you can use this function to invert a depth map's Z-values, in which case only a single source depth map is required. Note that 3D geometries of type M_BOX and M_POINT are not supported for this function. All image operands must be fully corrected depth maps for this operation. To determine if you have a fully corrected depth map, call McalInquire() with M_DEPTH_MAP and ensure that it returns M_TRUE. Note that if the two operands are images, their respective camera calibration information can vary in Z, but not in X or Y. All operations are performed using the Z-world coordinates corresponding to the gray levels of the image operands or the surface point of a 3D geometry operand. The resulting Z-world coordinates are then converted back to gray levels, according to the camera calibration information of the destination buffer. If the Z-scale and Z-offset of the destination are such that the 3D point falls outside the vertical span of the destination buffer, the destination pixel will be saturated to either 0 or the maximum value of the buffer, minus 1 (since the maximum value of a depth map represents missing data). Some pixels of the destination buffer can be left unchanged by providing a mask image buffer with the corresponding pixels set to 0. By default, the destination buffer does not have to be calibrated before calling M3dimArith(). The function will fill the destination buffer and associate it with the necessary camera calibration information. You can, however, specify to use the existing camera calibration information of the destination buffer, by passing M_USE_DESTINATION_SCALES to the ControlFlag parameter. If the destination is a container and you pass M_USE_DESTINATION_SCALES to the ControlFlag parameter, the container must be a 3D-processable depth map container. If either or both operands contain missing data (represented using the maximum value of the depth map buffer), missing data might be written to the destination buffer, depending on the value passed to the Operation parameter. Parameters Parameters Src1ImageBufOrGeometry3dgeoId Specifies the first source container, image buffer, or 3D geometry object. For specifying the first source container, image buffer, or 3D geometry object identifier Value Description M_XY_PLANE Specifies the first operand to be the XY (Z=0) plane. 3D geometry object identifier Specifies the first operand to be a 3D geometry object. The 3D geometry object must have been previously allocated on the required system using M3dgeoAlloc() and must have been successfully defined. Note that 3D geometries of type M_BOX and M_POINT are not supported for this function. Depth map container identifier Specifies the first operand to be a depth map container. The container must store data in a 3D-processable depth map format (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE), and must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC. Image buffer identifier Specifies the first operand to be an image buffer that contains a fully corrected depth map. The image buffer must be a 1-band, 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit unsigned buffer and must contain a fully corrected depth map (that is, if you call McalInquire() with M_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE). It must also have the same dimensions and bit depth as the destination buffer (DstImageBufId). This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Src2ImageBufOrGeometry3dgeoId Specifies the second source container, image buffer, or 3D geometry object. If a second source is not required, set this parameter to M_NULL. For specifying the second source container, image buffer, or 3D geometry object identifier Value Description M_XY_PLANE Specifies the second operand to be the XY (Z=0) plane. 3D geometry object identifier Specifies the second operand to be a 3D geometry object. The 3D geometry object must have been previously allocated on the required system using M3dgeoAlloc() and must have been successfully defined. Note that 3D geometries of type M_BOX and M_POINT are not supported for this function. Depth map container identifier Specifies the second operand to be a depth map container. The container must store data in a 3D-processable depth map format (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE), and must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC. Image buffer identifier Specifies the second operand to be an image buffer that contains a fully corrected depth map. The image buffer must be a 1-band, 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit unsigned buffer and must contain a fully corrected depth map (that is, if you call McalInquire() with M_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE). It must also have the same dimensions and bit depth as the destination buffer (DstImageBufId). This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. When both operands are depth map image buffers, their calibration information can vary in Z, but not in X and Y. That is, the Src2ImageBufOrGeometry3dgeoId parameter must have the same camera calibration information for X and Y as the image buffer specified with Src1ImageBufOrGeometry3dgeoId. The operation is performed point-to-point; therefore, each respective pixel must represent the same area in the real world in X and Y. DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination container or image buffer in which to put the result of the arithmetic operation. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must not be a child container. If you pass M_USE_DESTINATION_SCALES to the ControlFlag parameter, the container must be a 3D-processable depth map container (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE). The image buffer must be a 1-band, 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit unsigned buffer. The image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. MaskBufId Specifies the identifier of the image buffer to use as a mask, if needed. For specifying the mask identifier Value Description M_NULL Specifies to write to all pixels in the destination buffer; no mask will be used. Image buffer identifier Specifies the identifier of the image buffer to use as a mask in the arithmetic operation. Pixels in the destination buffer corresponding to pixels set to 0 in the mask buffer are left unchanged, while the other destination pixels will be the result of the arithmetic operation. The image buffer must be a 1-band, binary, 8-bit, or 16-bit buffer, and must have the same dimensions as the destination buffer (DstImageBufId). This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Operation Specifies the operation to perform. For specifying the operation to perform Value Description M_DIST_NN( MIL_INT NeighborhoodSize ) Calculates the absolute difference between the Z-coordinates of corresponding pixels of a depth map and an operand, considering the neighborhood pixels. Typically, this is performed when comparing two depth maps of highly similar objects or features, which are slightly misaligned. M_DIST_NN() compensates for the misalignment. This is a more robust version of the M_SUB_ABS operation, which calculates the Z-coordinate difference without considering the neighborhood of pixels. If either operand is missing data for a certain pixel, the corresponding destination pixel is set to the value for missing data (255, 65535, or 4294967295 for an 8-, 16-, or 32-bit depth map, respectively). Parameters NeighborhoodSize Specifies the size of the neighborhood. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 255 Specifies the size of the height and width of the neighborhood, in pixels, rounded up to the next odd number. Typically, this is a value between 3 and 7. Specifying 2 or 3 will create a 3x3 neighborhood, specifying 4 or 5 will create a 5x5 neighborhood, specifying 6 or 7 will result in a 7x7 neighborhood. The larger the value, the longer the operation will take and the more robust it will be to misalignment. Note that very large values can return insignificant results. Note that specifying 0 or 1 will create a 1x1 neighborhood, which is no neighborhood other than the pixel. This renders this macro equivalent to the M_SUB_ABS operation. M_DIST_NN_SIGNED( MIL_INT NeighborhoodSize ) Calculates the signed difference between the Z-coordinates of corresponding pixels of a depth map and an operand, considering the neighborhood pixels. Typically, this is performed when comparing two depth maps of highly similar objects or features, which are slightly misaligned. M_DIST_NN_SIGNED() compensates for the misalignment. This is a more robust version of the M_SUB operation, which calculates the Z-coordinate difference without considering the neighborhood of pixels. M_DIST_NN_SIGNED() is equivalent to M_DIST_NN(), except that it returns a signed distance. If operand 1 has a higher Z-coordinate than operand 2, the returned value is positive. Otherwise the returned value is negative. If either operand is missing data for a certain pixel, the corresponding destination pixel is set to the value for missing data (255, 65535, or 4294967295 for an 8-, 16-, or 32-bit depth map, respectively). Parameters NeighborhoodSize Specifies the size of the neighborhood. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 255 Specifies the size of the height and width of the neighborhood, in pixels, rounded up to the next odd number. Typically, this is a value between 3 and 7. Specifying 2 or 3 will create a 3x3 neighborhood, specifying 4 or 5 will create a 5x5 neighborhood, specifying 6 or 7 will result in a 7x7 neighborhood. The larger the value, the longer the operation will take and the more robust it will be to misalignment. Note that very large values can return insignificant results. Note that specifying 0 or 1 will create a 1x1 neighborhood, which is no neighborhood other than the pixel. This renders this macro equivalent to the M_SUB operation. M_ADD Adds the Z-coordinate of the first operand to the Z-coordinate of the second operand. Destination = (Operand 1 + Operand 2) If either operand is missing data, the destination is set to the value for missing data. M_FLIP_Z Inverts a depth map's Z values; bright values become dark, and dark values become bright. Note that any missing values are not inverted. Destination = (Maximum value of source buffer - Operand 1) If Operand 1 is missing data, the destination is set to the value for missing data. Note that you cannot use a mask when performing this operation. M_MAX Compares the Z-coordinate of the first operand with the Z-coordinate of the second operand, and takes the greater of the two. Destination = max(Operand 1, Operand 2) If both operands are missing data, the destination is set to the value for missing data. If a single operand is missing data, the destination is set to the value of the other operand. M_MIN Compares the Z-coordinate of the first operand with the Z-coordinate of the second operand, and takes the lesser of the two. Destination = min(Operand 1, Operand 2) If both operands are missing data, the destination is set to the value for missing data. If a single operand is missing data, the destination is set to the value of the other operand. M_REPLACE_MISSING_DATA Returns an image that is the same as the first source depth map, except that any missing values are replaced by their corresponding values from the second source. This operation is available only when the first source is a depth map. M_SUB Subtracts the Z-coordinate of the second operand from the Z-coordinate of the first operand. Destination = (Operand 1 - Operand 2) If either operand is missing data, the destination is set to the value for missing data. M_SUB_ABS Subtracts the Z-coordinate of the second operand from the Z-coordinate of the first operand, and takes the absolute value of the result. This operation is equivalent to taking the absolute value of the M_SUB operation. Destination = | Operand 1 - Operand 2| If either operand is missing data, the destination is set to the value for missing data. M_VALIDITY_MAP Returns an image corresponding to the validity of each pixel in the two operands. Pixel in operand 1 Pixel in operand 2 Returned to corresponding pixel in the destination Value Constant M_INVALID_POINT M_INVALID_POINT 0 M_NO_SRC_VALID_LABEL Valid point M_INVALID_POINT 85 M_ONLY_SRC1_VALID_LABEL M_INVALID_POINT Valid point 170 M_ONLY_SRC2_VALID_LABEL Valid point Valid point 255 M_BOTH_SRC_VALID_LABEL Note that the DstImageBufId parameter must be given an image buffer identifier. SignMode Specifies which Z-coordinate to select for geometries with more than 1 Z-coordinate for a given pair of X- and Y-coordinates. When the two sources are depth maps, or when performing an M_FLIP_Z operation, the SignMode parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. For specifying the sign mode Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_MAX_Z. M_MAX_Z Specifies to use the surface point with the largest Z-coordinate value. M_MIN_Z Specifies to use the surface point with the smallest Z-coordinate value. ControlFlag Specifies how to handle the camera calibration information of the destination image buffer. For specifying how to handle the camera calibration information of the destination image buffer Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_FIT_SCALES. This is the only possible value for M_FLIP_Z and M_VALIDITY_MAP. M_FIT_SCALES Specifies to choose the Z-scale and Z-offset so that the values can be represented in the destination image buffer without saturation. This mode depends only on the possible range of the data, and not on the actual source depth map contents. Note that the X- and Y-scales and offsets of the destination image buffer will be set to the same values as those of the source image(s). After calling M3dimArith(), the destination image buffer will be fully corrected. Note that in extreme cases, M_DIST_NN() and M_DIST_NN_SIGNED() can return saturated pixels because the Euclidean distance is calculated and not just the Z-coordinate distance. M_SET_WORLD_OFFSET_Z Specifies to keep the same Z-scale as the first source image and to set the Z-offset so that the destination image buffer Z-range covers the center of the possible range of the data. Since the Z-scale remains unaltered, it is possible for saturation to occur. The X- and Y-scales and offsets of the destination image buffer will be set to the same values as those of the source image(s). After calling M3dimArith(), the destination image buffer will be fully corrected. M_USE_DESTINATION_SCALES Specifies to use the camera calibration information of the destination image buffer. This means the destination must be fully corrected before calling M3dimArith(), and have the same scales and offsets in X and Y as the source image(s). This can be done by copying the camera calibration information from another image using McalAssociate(), or by providing scales and offsets manually using McalUniform() or using McalControl() with M_GRAY_LEVEL_SIZE_Z and M_WORLD_POS_Z. M3dimArith() will leave the camera calibration information of the destination image buffer unchanged. M_USE_SOURCE1_SCALES Specifies to use the calibration information of the first source. This option is not available when the Src1ImageBufOrGeometry3dgeoId parameter is set to M_XY_PLANE. M_USE_SOURCE2_SCALES Specifies to use the calibration information of the second source. This option is not available when the Src2ImageBufOrGeometry3dgeoId parameter is set to M_XY_PLANE. Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; mil3dim.lib.

Using M3dimControl(), you can set the depth map's required pixel aspect ratio. You can also set a fixed size along 1 dimension, and the function will calculate the necessary size of the other dimension (for either pixel size or image buffer size). Default settings let M3dimCalculateMapSize() do all calculations. Parameters Parameters CalculateMapSizeContext3dimId Specifies a calculate map size 3D image processing context. For specifying the calculate map size 3D image processing context identifier Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default calculate map size 3D image processing context of the current MIL application. The operation will use default values for all calculate map size context control types (M3dimControl()). MIL calculate map size 3D image processing context identifier Specifies the identifier of a calculate map size 3D image processing context, previously allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_CALCULATE_MAP_SIZE_CONTEXT. If a calculate map size context is specified, the function applies the calculate map size control settings specified using M3dimControl(). SrcContainerBufId Specifies the identifier of the source container containing a 3D-processable point cloud. The container must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE). The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC. AABox3dgeoId Specifies the identifier of the axis-aligned 3D box geometry object to use to limit the calculation to points within the box. The 3D box geometry object must have been previously allocated using M3dgeoAlloc() with M_GEOMETRY, and defined as a box. If a 3D box geometry object is not required, set this parameter to M_NULL. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. DepthMapSizeXPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the estimated depth map image buffer size in X. DepthMapSizeYPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the estimated depth map image buffer size in Y. Compilation information Header Include mil.h.

      "text": " M3dimCalibrateDepthMap Synopsis Calibrate a buffer based on the bounding box of a container's point cloud, or an axis-aligned 3D box geometry, to prepare the buffer to hold a depth or intensity map. Syntax void M3dimCalibrateDepthMap( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcContainerBufOrGeometry3dgeoId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DepthMapImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;IntensityMapImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;CalibrationMilObjectOrMatrix3dgeoId, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;PixelSizeAspectRatio, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ZSign, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function calibrates a buffer based on the bounding box of a container's point cloud, or an axis-aligned 3D box geometry. For a point cloud, the source container's M_COMPONENT_RANGE and M_COMPONENT_CONFIDENCE components are used to establish the bounding box. The calibration prepares the buffer to hold depth map or intensity map information. To generate a depth map from a point cloud or 3D geometry, or to generate an intensity map, use M3dimProject(). M3dimCalibrateDepthMap() sets the real-world to pixel unit scale for the image buffer, and sets the real-world to gray level scale (M_GRAY_LEVEL_SIZE_Z) for depth values. You can set this function's PixelSizeAspectRatio to M_NULL to ensure an unconstrained pixel aspect ratio, so that source data fits completely into the depth map. If the PixelSizeAspectRatio parameter is not set to M_NULL, there can be leftover, unused pixel rows or columns in the destination. You can specify where to place valid values in the destination buffer with the ControlFlag parameter and M_DEFAULT or M_CENTER. In the M_DEFAULT case, the data aligns to the top left of the buffer, and the function calculates a pixel size such that the data extends at least the breadth of one dimension, and no data is lost along the other dimension. In the M_CENTER case, valid data is centered in the buffer and extends the full breadth of one dimension with no loss of data along the other dimension. M3dimProject() will set pixels in unused rows or columns to the invalid pixel value. Note that the calculated pixel size does not distort the world data and the overall aspect ratio of source information is maintained. Also note that a projected point retains its source coordinate values, regardless of whether the corresponding pixel is centered (M_CENTER) or not (M_DEFAULT). This means that the depth map's top-left pixel will have different world XY-coordinates, depending on the ControlFlag setting. See the Specifying data placement in the destination image buffer subsection of the Generating fully corrected depth and intensity maps section of Chapter 35: 3D image processing for more information. By default, the relative coordinate system is set to the same location as the absolute coordinate system. You can optionally set the relative coordinate system to a different location by specifying (with CalibrationMilObjectOrMatrix3dgeoId) a calibration context, a calibrated MIL object, or a transformation matrix object. If the destination is a depth map container, matrix information will be added to the M_COMPONENT_MATRIX_MIL component of the container. Note that the pixel-to-world mapping of the specified calibration context or calibrated MIL object is not used. Parameters Parameters SrcContainerBufOrGeometry3dgeoId Specifies the identifier of the source point cloud container or 3D geometry object. The point cloud container must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE). The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC. The 3D geometry object must be an axis-aligned box, previously allocated using M3dgeoAlloc() with M_GEOMETRY, and defined as a box. DepthMapImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer or container with which to associate the calibration information for a depth map. The destination image buffer must be a 1-band, 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit unsigned image buffer. The destination container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, must store data in a 3D-processable depth map format (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE), and must not be a child container. IntensityMapImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer with which to associate the calibration information for an intensity map. This image buffer must have the same dimensions as the buffer specified for DepthMapImageBufId. If an intensity map is not required, set this parameter to M_NULL. CalibrationMilObjectOrMatrix3dgeoId Specifies the identifier of the MIL object that defines the relationship between the relative and absolute coordinate systems in the depth map. The MIL object can be a camera calibration context, a 3D reconstruction context, a 3D reconstruction result buffer, or any object that has camera calibration information, such as an image or result buffer. It can also be a transformation matrix object, previously allocated using M3dgeoAlloc() with M_TRANSFORMATION_MATRIX. If the destination is a depth map container, matrix information will be added to the M_COMPONENT_MATRIX_MIL component. If no calibration context or object associated with a camera calibration context is required, set this parameter to M_NULL. PixelSizeAspectRatio Specifies how to adjust the X and Y pixel sizes. For specifying the pixel aspect ratio Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. M_NULL Specifies to apply a pixel aspect ratio such that the source container's bounding box or the axis-aligned box fits exactly inside the dimensions of the destination image buffer or container. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies an aspect ratio for the destination pixels. The pixel size is computed such that the pixel's length in X divided by its length in Y equals the specified PixelSizeAspectRatio value. ZSign Specifies the sign of the Z-scale. The sign applies to M_GRAY_LEVEL_SIZE_Z, which sets the length, in world units, of one gray level in a fully-corrected depth map. For specifying the Z-scale sign Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_POSITIVE. M_NEGATIVE Specifies a negative value for M_GRAY_LEVEL_SIZE_Z. A negative value indicates that larger Z-values are represented by darker depth map pixels, and the smaller the Z-value the brighter the pixel. M_POSITIVE Specifies a positive value for M_GRAY_LEVEL_SIZE_Z. A positive value indicates that larger Z-values are represented by brighter depth map pixels, and the smaller the Z-value the darker the pixel. ControlFlag Specifies where to place valid values in the depth map. When PixelSizeAspectRatio is set to M_NULL, ControlFlag must be set to M_DEFAULT. For specifying the control flag Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that, once M3dimProject() is called, the point cloud or 3D geometry data is projected onto the depth map buffer such that it aligns to the top left of the buffer, and the data extends at least the breadth of one dimension, leaving space at the bottom or right. M3dimProject() will set pixels in unused rows or columns to the invalid pixel value. The source data maintains its aspect ratio. M_CENTER Specifies that, once M3dimProject() is called, the point cloud data is projected onto the depth map buffer such that it is centered horizontally or vertically in the buffer. M3dimProject() will set pixels in unused rows or columns to the invalid pixel value. The source data maintains its aspect ratio. Compilation information Header Include mil.h.

See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Parameter associations The table below lists possible values for the Context3dimId, ControlType, and ControlValue parameters. For specifying the control type and control value for a 3D image processing context The following Context3dimId, ControlType, and ControlValue parameter settings can be specified for different types of 3D image processing contexts. For specifying the control type and control value for a 3D image processing context Context3dimId Description ControlType ControlValue Calculate map size context ID Specifies a calculate map size 3D image processing context, allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_CALCULATE_MAP_SIZE_CONTEXT, and used in M3dimCalculateMapSize() operations. The recommended size is useful for allocating a depth map image buffer (using MbufAlloc2d()) before calling M3dimProject(). M_CALCULATE_MODE Sets whether the source point cloud container is organized. M3dimCalculateMapSize() calculations are faster with organized point clouds. M_DEFAULT Same as M_UNORGANIZED. M_ORGANIZED Specifies an organized point cloud. Note that using this value with an unorganized point will cause an error. M_UNORGANIZED Specifies an unorganized point cloud. M_PIXEL_ASPECT_RATIO Sets the pixel aspect ratio of the depth map. This option must be set to M_NULL if you have already specified a pixel size with M_PIXEL_SIZE_X and M_PIXEL_SIZE_Y. Otherwise, an error will occur. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. M_NULL Specifies that other data determines the pixel aspect ratio, such as the values set with M_PIXEL_SIZE_X and M_PIXEL_SIZE_Y. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies an aspect ratio for the depth map's pixels. The pixel size is computed such that the pixel's length in X divided by its length in Y equals the specified M_PIXEL_ASPECT_RATIO value. M_PIXEL_SIZE_X Sets the length in X of one pixel in the depth map. Note that you cannot specify a specific value for M_PIXEL_SIZE_X if you have done so for M_SIZE_X (and vice versa). This option must be set to M_NULL if you have already specified a pixel aspect ratio with M_PIXEL_ASPECT_RATIO. Otherwise, an error will occur. M_DEFAULT Same as M_NULL. M_NULL Specifies that M3dimCalculateMapSize() will compute the pixel size in X. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the length in X of one pixel in the depth map, in world units. M_PIXEL_SIZE_Y Sets the length in Y of one pixel in the depth map. Note that you cannot specify a specific value for M_PIXEL_SIZE_Y if you have done so for M_SIZE_Y (and vice versa). This option must be set to M_NULL if you have already specified a pixel aspect ratio with M_PIXEL_ASPECT_RATIO. Otherwise, an error will occur. M_DEFAULT Same as M_NULL. M_NULL Specifies that M3dimCalculateMapSize() will compute the pixel size in Y. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the length in Y of one pixel in the depth map, in world units. M_SIZE_X Sets the image size of the depth map along the X dimension. Note that you cannot set M_SIZE_X and M_SIZE_Y at the same time. Note that you cannot specify a specific value for M_SIZE_X if you have done so for M_PIXEL_SIZE_X (and vice versa). M_DEFAULT Same as M_NULL. M_NULL Specifies that M3dimCalculateMapSize() will compute the image size of the depth map in X. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the image size of the depth map in X, in pixel units. M_SIZE_Y Sets the image size of the depth map along the Y dimension. Note that you cannot set M_SIZE_X and M_SIZE_Y at the same time. Note that you cannot specify a specific value for M_SIZE_Y if you have done so for M_PIXEL_SIZE_Y (and vice versa). M_DEFAULT Same as M_NULL. M_NULL Specifies that M3dimCalculateMapSize() will compute the image size of the depth map in Y. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the image size of the depth map in Y, in pixel units. Fill gaps context ID Specifies a fill gaps 3D image processing context, allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_FILL_GAPS_CONTEXT, and used in M3dimFillGaps() operations. Gaps are missing or invalid data in a depth or intensity map. M_FILL_BORDER Sets whether to propagate the boundary value across each gap that touches the image border. M_DEFAULT Same as M_REPLICATE. M_DISABLE Specifies not to fill gaps that touch the image border. M_REPLICATE Specifies to propagate the unique gap boundary value across each gap that touches the image border, replacing gap pixels up to the image border. M_FILL_MODE Sets the mode in which to fill gaps in depth maps. M_DEFAULT Same as M_X_THEN_Y. M_X_THEN_Y Specifies that each depth map row is analyzed so that gap pixels in each row are filled, and then each column is analyzed to fill the remaining gaps. The filling operation used depends on the M_FILL_SHARP_ELEVATION_DEPTH and M_FILL_SHARP_ELEVATION control types. You can specify how to fill gaps that touch the image border with M_FILL_BORDER. M_Y_THEN_X Specifies that each depth map column is analyzed so that gap pixels in each column are filled, and then each row is analyzed to fill the remaining gaps. The filling operation used depends on the M_FILL_SHARP_ELEVATION_DEPTH and M_FILL_SHARP_ELEVATION control types. You can specify how to fill gaps that touch the image border with M_FILL_BORDER. M_FILL_SHARP_ELEVATION Sets which boundary to use to fill sharp elevation gaps in depth maps. You can specify to propagate either the minimum or maximum gap border value, or not to fill sharp elevation gaps. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies not to fill sharp elevation gaps. M_MAX Specifies to set the destination pixel(s) to the maximum value of the two pixels on either side of the gap. M_MIN Specifies to set the destination pixel(s) to the minimum value of the two pixels on either side of the gap. M_FILL_SHARP_ELEVATION_DEPTH Sets the threshold used to differentiate between gradual elevation gaps and sharp elevation gaps in the depth map. If the difference between a gap's boundary values is less than the specified threshold, the gap is considered a gradual elevation gap, otherwise it is considered a sharp elevation gap. Gradual elevation gaps are filled using linear interpolation; sharp elevation gaps are either filled by propagating the value of one of the boundaries or are left unfilled, depending on the M_FILL_SHARP_ELEVATION control type. It is often better to fill gradual elevation gaps using linear interpolation since the underlying surface of such a gap is considered to be part of the same surface as its boundaries. Whereas for sharp elevation gaps, the underlying surface is considered to be discontinuous at least at one of its boundaries, so propagating the value of one of the boundaries is recommended. If a gap is greater than M_FILL_SHARP_ELEVATION_DEPTH, it is replaced using the secondary algorithm described in M_FILL_SHARP_ELEVATION. M_DEFAULT Same as M_INFINITE. M_INFINITE Specifies that the threshold is infinite. When M_INFINITE is specified, all gaps are considered gradual elevation gaps, so linear interpolation is always used and M_FILL_SHARP_ELEVATION is ignored. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the threshold, in pixel or world units, depending on the units specified with M_INPUT_UNITS. When the threshold is set to 0.0, all gaps are considered sharp elevation gaps, so linear interpolation is never used and all gaps are filled according to M_FILL_SHARP_ELEVATION. M_FILL_THRESHOLD_X Sets the maximum X-size of gaps that will be filled. If a gap is larger than the fill threshold in the X or Y direction, it is not replaced. M_DEFAULT Same as M_INFINITE. M_INFINITE Specifies no maximum in the X-direction. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the maximum X-size, in pixel or world units, depending on the units specified with M_INPUT_UNITS. M_FILL_THRESHOLD_Y Sets the maximum Y-size of gaps that will be filled. If a gap is larger than the fill threshold in the X or Y direction, it is not replaced. M_DEFAULT Same as M_INFINITE. M_INFINITE Specifies no maximum in the Y-direction. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the maximum Y-size, in pixel or world units, depending on the units specified with M_INPUT_UNITS. M_INPUT_UNITS Sets the units with which to interpret the M_FILL_SHARP_ELEVATION_DEPTH, M_FILL_THRESHOLD_X, and M_FILL_THRESHOLD_Y control types. M_DEFAULT Same as M_WORLD. M_PIXEL Specifies to interpret the values in pixel units. M_WORLD Specifies to interpret the values in world units. Filter context ID Specifies a filter 3D image processing context, allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_FILTER_CONTEXT, and used in M3dimFilter() operations. M_DISTANCE_WEIGHT Sets the amount of smoothing. A larger value applies more smoothing than a smaller value. This control type affects the calculation of the distance Gaussian weight, which is used in the smoothing computation and applies to the distance between points in a neighborhood; the exact calculation depends on the specified weight mode. If M_WEIGHT_MODE is set to M_ABSOLUTE, a point's distance Gaussian weight is set equal to M_DISTANCE_WEIGHT. If M_WEIGHT_MODE is set to M_RELATIVE, the distance Gaussian weight is set to M_DISTANCE_WEIGHT * d , where d is an internal value calculated from a point's distance to its neighbors and the number of neighborhood points. If you are unsure of exact values to use, you can set M_WEIGHT_MODE to M_RELATIVE, and MIL will find a heuristic value as a function of the calculated point density, and then you can increase or decrease the multiplicative factors (M_NORMALS_WEIGHT_FACTOR and M_DISTANCE_WEIGHT) to control the degree of smoothing. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the amount of smoothing. M_FILTER_MODE Sets the type of smoothing operation to perform. Deciding which mode to use depends on your data and application. In general, M_SMOOTH_MLS performs a simple averaging, while M_SMOOTH_BILATERAL conserves edges. M_DEFAULT Same as M_SMOOTH_BILATERAL. M_SMOOTH_BILATERAL Specifies to smooth the point cloud using a bilateral filter. A bilateral filter smooths a point cloud while preserving its features; it is effectively an edge-preserving filter. This operation examines a point's distance to its neighbors as well as its distance along a normal direction, to which Gaussian weights are applied. You can control the degree of smoothing and edge preservation with M_DISTANCE_WEIGHT and M_NORMALS_WEIGHT_FACTOR, respectively. M_SMOOTH_MLS Specifies to smooth the point cloud using a moving least squares (MLS) filter. MLS performs a local plane fit at each point, projecting the point onto the locally fitted tangent plane. M_NORMALS_WEIGHT_FACTOR Sets how well edges are preserved for an M_SMOOTH_BILATERAL operation. A smaller value results in more edge preservation. This control type sets the point normal Gaussian weight (s normal) relative to the distance Gaussian weight (s distance), according to the following equation: s normal = M_NORMALS_WEIGHT_FACTOR * s distance . This control type is ignored when M_FILTER_MODE is set to M_SMOOTH_MLS. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies how well edges are preserved for a bilateral smoothing operation. M_USE_SOURCE_NORMALS Sets whether to use the source point cloud's normals information, stored in the source container's M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL component. Note that point normal values are necessary for the filter operation. Setting this control type to M_FALSE means that a source normals component is not used, but that normals are freshly calculated. When M_TRUE is specified, point normals are not recalculated if they exist in the source container. M_DEFAULT Same as M_TRUE. M_FALSE Specifies not to use source normals information. M_TRUE Specifies to use source normals information. M_WEIGHT_MODE Sets how the Gaussian weights are determined in the smoothing operation set with M_FILTER_MODE. M_DEFAULT Same as M_RELATIVE. M_ABSOLUTE Specifies to use the distance Gaussian weight directly, without applying a multiplying factor. M_RELATIVE Specifies to compute and apply a multiplying factor to the distance Gaussian weight. The relative weight (multiplying factor) is computed as a function of point distances to their neighbors and the number of points in the neighborhood. Lattice context ID Specifies a lattice 3D image processing context, allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_LATTICE_CONTEXT, and used in M3dimLattice() operations. M_FRACTION_OF_POINTS Sets the ratio of the total number of required cells to the total number of valid points in the point cloud. MIL will try to divide the point cloud into cells such that the required number of cells contain at least 1 valid point each. Note that the lattice might have extra cells that are empty or that contain only invalid points, depending on the structure of the point cloud. If your point cloud contains 100 valid points and you specify a fraction of 0.25, M3dimLattice() will attempt to divide the valid points into approximately 25 cells. You can specify the tolerance for this amount using M_FRACTION_OF_POINTS_TOLERANCE. Given the example above, if you specify a tolerance of 0.1, M3dimLattice() will attempt to calculate a lattice such that the number of cells with valid points is between 15 and 35. M_FRACTION_OF_POINTS determines the number of points that will be left in the point cloud after subsampling and the number of valid depth map pixels after projecting. When using the calculated lattice to subsample the point cloud, M3dimSample() selects 1 point per cell. Empty cells or cells containing only invalid points are ignored. When using the calculated lattice to project the point cloud, M3dimProject() projects all the points in a cell to the same depth map pixel. Empty cells or cells containing only invalid points will result in invalid pixels. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.5. 0.0 &lt; Value &lt;= 1.0 Specifies the ratio of required cells to valid points. M_FRACTION_OF_POINTS_TOLERANCE Sets the tolerance to use for M_FRACTION_OF_POINTS when calculating the lattice. M3dimLattice() will attempt to calculate a lattice where the minimum number of cells containing valid points is the total number of valid points in the point cloud * (M_FRACTION_OF_POINTS - M_FRACTION_OF_POINTS_TOLERANCE) and the maximum is the total number of valid points in the point cloud * (M_FRACTION_OF_POINTS + M_FRACTION_OF_POINTS_TOLERANCE). Note that the lattice is bound by the structure of the points. Some fractions are not always possible. Note also that the lower the tolerance, the longer M3dimLattice() will take to complete. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.05. 0.0 &lt; Value &lt; 1.0 Specifies the tolerance for the required number of cells. M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_X Sets the proportion of the cell size along the X dimension relative to the cell sizes along the Y and Z dimensions. For example, if you set M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_X to 1.0, M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_Y to M_INFINITE, and M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_Z to 2.0, the cells will be twice as long in the Z direction compared to the X direction. Note that when subsampling using the calculated lattice, calling M3dimSample() generates an error if more than 1 of M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_X, M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_Y, or M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_Z is set to M_INFINITE. Note that when projecting using the calculated lattice, M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_Z must be set to M_INFINITE and M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_X and M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_Y must be set to non-infinite values. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. M_INFINITE Specifies an infinite cell size along X. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the relative cell size along X. M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_Y Sets the proportion of the cell size along the Y dimension relative to the cell sizes along the X and Z dimensions. For example, if you set M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_X to 1.0, M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_Y to M_INFINITE, and M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_Z to 2.0, the cells will be twice as long in the Z direction compared to the X direction. Note that when subsampling using the calculated lattice, calling M3dimSample() generates an error if more than 1 of M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_X, M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_Y, or M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_Z is set to M_INFINITE. Note that when projecting using the calculated lattice, M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_Z must be set to M_INFINITE and M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_X and M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_Y must be set to non-infinite values. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. M_INFINITE Specifies an infinite cell size along Y. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the relative cell size along Y. M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_Z Sets the proportion of the cell size along the Z dimension relative to the cell sizes along the X and Y dimensions. For example, if you set M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_X to 1.0, M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_Y to M_INFINITE, and M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_Z to 2.0, the cells will be twice as long in the Z direction compared to the X direction. Note that when subsampling using the calculated lattice, calling M3dimSample() generates an error if more than 1 of M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_X, M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_Y, or M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_Z is set to M_INFINITE. Note that when projecting using the calculated lattice, M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_Z must be set to M_INFINITE and M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_X and M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_Y must be set to non-infinite values. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. M_INFINITE Specifies an infinite cell size along Z. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the relative cell size along Z. Mesh context ID Specifies a mesh 3D image processing context, allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_MESH_CONTEXT, and used in M3dimMesh() operations. When setting mesh control types, first use M_MESH_MODE to set the surface reconstruction mode, and then specify appropriate settings as per the specified mode. Not all control types are available for each mode. M_MAX_DISTANCE Sets the maximum distance at which to connect 2 neighboring points. This control type is only available when M_MESH_MODE is set to M_MESH_ORGANIZED. M_DEFAULT Same as M_INFINITE. M_INFINITE Specifies no distance constraint. Value Specifies the maximum distance. Any 2 points separated by a distance greater than the specified value will not be connected. M_MAXIMUM_NUMBER_NEIGHBORS Sets the maximum number of neighbors to consider when computing a local plane at each point. This control type is available only when M_MESH_MODE is set to M_MESH_LOCAL_PLANE. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 100. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the maximum number of neighbor points. M_MESH_MODE Sets the surface reconstruction mode to use for mesh generation. When you set the mode to M_MESH_SMOOTHED, you can trim the mesh to discard outlier points with M_MESH_TRIMMING_LEVEL. M_MESH_LOCAL_PLANE Specifies to generate the mesh from local planes that are fit to neighboring points. For each point, neighborhood points are projected to the local plane and the most suitable points in the source point cloud are chosen to form a mesh triangle with the point in question. With this mode, the mesh can have holes. Normal vectors at each point are required. To calculate normal vectors, use M3dimNormals(). M_MESH_ORGANIZED Specifies to generate the mesh from an organized point cloud. This mode connects neighboring points and can result in a mesh with holes due to invalid points in the point cloud. M_MESH_SMOOTHED Specifies to generate a mesh with a smoothed surface. With this mode, MIL creates a new point cloud that has been smoothed to reduce noise; missing data is approximated when possible, resulting in significantly fewer holes. The operation uses a Poisson surface reconstruction algorithm. Normal vectors at each point are required. To calculate normal vectors, use M3dimNormals(). M_MESH_STEP_X Sets the step interval between points, along the X dimension. Points are selected from the source point cloud's M_COMPONENT_RANGE and M_COMPONENT_CONFIDENCE components, where the point cloud's X-, Y-, and Z-coordinates are stored in separate bands of an organized 2D buffer. M_MESH_STEP_X specifies an interval in X for each band. The M3dimMesh() function connects points that are separated by the specified interval, when creating triangular planes for surface reconstruction. Note that, if an invalid point is located at the specified interval (that is, the point's confidence score is 0), no vertex of a triangular plane is formed at this point, and a gap is possible in the resulting mesh. This control type is only available when M_MESH_MODE is set to M_MESH_ORGANIZED. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1. Value Specifies the step interval in the X direction. M_MESH_STEP_Y Sets the step interval between points, along the Y dimension. Points are selected from the source point cloud's M_COMPONENT_RANGE and M_COMPONENT_CONFIDENCE components, where the point cloud's X-, Y-, and Z-coordinates are stored in separate bands of an organized 2D buffer. M_MESH_STEP_Y specifies an interval in Y for each band. The M3dimMesh() function connects points that are separated by the specified interval, when creating triangular planes for surface reconstruction. Note that, if an invalid point is located at the specified interval (that is, the point's confidence score is 0), no vertex of a triangular plane is formed at this point, and a gap is possible in the resulting mesh. This control type is only available when M_MESH_MODE is set to M_MESH_ORGANIZED. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1. Value Specifies the step interval in the Y direction. M_MESH_TRIMMING_LEVEL Sets the trimming level for a mesh, which is applied as a threshold to discard outlier points. Setting a higher value will trim more from the mesh. Note that MIL applies the threshold to an internal measurement that is related to the density of the vertices in the mesh. A typical value for this control type is 7.0. To disable mesh trimming, set M_MESH_TRIMMING_LEVEL to 0.0. This control type is available only when M_MESH_MODE is set to M_MESH_SMOOTHED. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_AUTO Specifies to automatically calculate the trimming level. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the trimming level. M_NEIGHBOR_SEARCH_MODE Sets the search mode for finding the neighbors of a point. This control type is available only when M_MESH_MODE is set to M_MESH_LOCAL_PLANE. M_DEFAULT Same as M_TREE. M_ORGANIZED Specifies to use the point cloud's organizational structure to determine the neighbors of a point. This option is supported only for an organized point cloud. M_TREE Specifies to use a KD tree search mode to determine a point's neighbors. M_NEIGHBORHOOD_DISTANCE Sets the distance that defines the neighborhood of a point; only points within this distance are considered when calculating the local plane of the point. This control type is available only when M_MESH_MODE is set to M_MESH_LOCAL_PLANE. M_DEFAULT Same as M_INFINITE. M_INFINITE Specifies no distance constraint. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the neighborhood distance limit, in world units. M_NEIGHBORHOOD_ORGANIZED_SIZE Sets the neighborhood size when finding the neighbors of a point in an organized point cloud. The size determines the number of elements along a row or column of the 2D buffer of the range and confidence components. For example, if you set M_NEIGHBORHOOD_ORGANIZED_SIZE to 7, the neighborhood is a 7-element by 7-element region in the source container's 2D grid organization (specifically, in the organized point cloud's M_COMPONENT_RANGE and M_COMPONENT_CONFIDENCE components). This control type is supported only when using an organized point cloud and only if M_NEIGHBOR_SEARCH_MODE is set to M_ORGANIZED. This control type is available only when M_MESH_MODE is set to M_MESH_LOCAL_PLANE. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 9. Value &gt;= 3 Specifies the organized neighborhood size, in number of pixels; the specified value must be an odd number. M_NUMBER_POINTS_PER_CELL Sets the number of points within a single octree cell at which the cell will not be split further. This control type is only available when M_MESH_MODE is set to M_MESH_SMOOTHED. For example, if M_NUMBER_POINTS_PER_CELL is set to 3, any octree cell with 3 or fewer points is not divided further. A larger M_NUMBER_POINTS_PER_CELL can minimize effects due to noise in the source cloud data. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1. Value Specifies the number of points, within a single octree cell, at which the cell will not be split further. M_SURFACE_ANGLE_MAX Sets the maximum acceptable angle between the normal of a point and that of a neighboring point for the neighbor to be considered for triangulation. If the angle is within this limit, the neighboring point could be part of a triangle for the mesh. This control type is available only when M_MESH_MODE is set to M_MESH_LOCAL_PLANE. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 45.0. 0.0 &lt; Value &lt; 180.0 Specifies the maximum angle, in degrees. M_TREE_MAX_DEPTH Sets the maximum allowed depth of the octree. The octree partitions the 3D space for the mesh calculation. This control type is only available when M_MESH_MODE is set to M_MESH_SMOOTHED. The maximum tree depth determines the resolution of the 3D mesh. For example, an M_TREE_MAX_DEPTH set to 8 gives a mesh with a resolution of 2 8 x 2 8 x 2 8 . Note that a higher octree value gives a higher resolution, but a slower calculation time. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 8. 5 &lt;= Value &lt;= 12 Specifies the maximum octree depth. M_TRIANGLE_ANGLE_MAX Sets the maximum interior angle for each mesh triangle. The specified angle must be greater than or equal to the minimum interior angle (M_TRIANGLE_ANGLE_MIN). Note that this maximum is guaranteed; larger angles will not occur. This control type is available only when M_MESH_MODE is set to M_MESH_LOCAL_PLANE. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 120.0. 0.0 &lt; Value &lt; 180.0 Specifies the maximum angle, in degrees. M_TRIANGLE_ANGLE_MIN Sets the minimum interior angle for each mesh triangle. The specified angle must be less than or equal to the maximum interior angle (M_TRIANGLE_ANGLE_MAX). Note that this minimum is not guaranteed; smaller angles might occur, due to the greedy nature of the meshing algorithm. This control type is available only when M_MESH_MODE is set to M_MESH_LOCAL_PLANE. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 10.0. 0.0 &lt; Value &lt; 180.0 Specifies the minimum angle, in degrees. Normals context ID Specifies a normals 3D image processing context, allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_NORMALS_CONTEXT, and used in M3dimNormals() operations. M_DIRECTION_MODE Sets the orientation of the normal vectors, towards a reference point or vector set with M_DIRECTION_REFERENCE_..., which are either the X-, Y-, and Z-coordinates of the reference point, or the X-, Y-, and Z-components of the reference vector. A point on a 3-dimensional surface has 2 normal vectors, each perpendicular to the surface, but pointing in opposite directions. M_DIRECTION_MODE sets a preferred orientation for the normals, and therefore sets which normal vector to choose for each point. For example, you can specify a reference point inside your 3D object and use M_AWAY_FROM_POSITION to ensure that all normal vectors point outwards from the object's surface. M_DEFAULT Same as M_TOWARDS_DIRECTION. M_AWAY_FROM_POSITION Specifies to choose, for each point, the normal vector that points away from the reference point specified with coordinates M_DIRECTION_REFERENCE_X, M_DIRECTION_REFERENCE_Y, and M_DIRECTION_REFERENCE_Z. M_TOWARDS_DIRECTION Specifies to choose, for each point, the normal vector that most closely aligns with the reference vector specified with vector components M_DIRECTION_REFERENCE_X, M_DIRECTION_REFERENCE_Y, and M_DIRECTION_REFERENCE_Z. M_TOWARDS_POSITION Specifies to choose, for each point, the normal vector that points towards the reference point specified with coordinates M_DIRECTION_REFERENCE_X, M_DIRECTION_REFERENCE_Y, and M_DIRECTION_REFERENCE_Z. M_DIRECTION_REFERENCE_X Sets the X-coordinate or vector component along X for the reference point or vector (respectively) that determines normal vector orientation. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value Specifies the X-coordinate or vector component along X. M_DIRECTION_REFERENCE_Y Sets the Y-coordinate or vector component along Y for the reference point or vector (respectively) that determines normal vector orientation. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value Specifies the Y-coordinate or vector component along Y. M_DIRECTION_REFERENCE_Z Sets the Z-coordinate or vector component along Z for the reference point or vector (respectively) that determines normal vector orientation. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value Specifies the Z-coordinate or vector component along Z. M_ENFORCE_CONTINUITY Sets whether to maintain the general direction of the normals, which prevents large, discontinuous jumps between normal vectors. For example, if 2 neighboring points have normal vectors (0,0,1) and (0,0,-0.9), 1 of the vectors will be flipped so that both point roughly in the same direction. This means that some normals will not respect the specified M_DIRECTION_MODE, but, on average, most normals will respect the specified orientation of the normal vectors. This option is supported only when M_NEIGHBOR_SEARCH_MODE is set to M_TREE. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to not enforce continuity of normal vectors. M_ENABLE Specifies to enforce continuity of normal vectors. M_MAXIMUM_NUMBER_NEIGHBORS Sets the maximum number of neighbors to consider when computing a point's normal vector. You must specify M_MAXIMUM_NUMBER_NEIGHBORS when using an M_TREE neighbor search mode. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 49. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the maximum number of neighbor points. M_NEIGHBOR_SEARCH_MODE Sets the search mode for finding the neighbors of a point, when calculating a point's surface normal vector. Note that M_ORGANIZED is usually faster, but is less robust to noise. You can optionally specify M_NEIGHBORHOOD_DISTANCE to reduce the effect of outlier neighborhood points. Invalid points in a neighborhood are not considered when calculating normal vectors. M_DEFAULT Same as M_TREE. M_MESH Specifies to use the point cloud's mesh component to determine the neighbors of a point. A mesh's triangular faces are composed of connected neighboring points. This option is available only when the source container has an M_COMPONENT_MESH_MIL component. M_ORGANIZED Specifies to use the point cloud's organizational structure to determine the neighbors of a point. This option is supported only for an organized point cloud. When M_ORGANIZED is specified, you must set either M_MAXIMUM_NUMBER_NEIGHBORS or M_NEIGHBORHOOD_ORGANIZED_SIZE to determine the extent of the neighborhood. M_TREE Specifies to use a KD tree search mode to determine a point's neighbors. When M_TREE is specified, you must also set M_MAXIMUM_NUMBER_NEIGHBORS. M_NEIGHBORHOOD_DISTANCE Sets the distance that defines the neighborhood of a point; only points within this distance are considered for normal vector calculations. This option is not supported when M_NEIGHBOR_SEARCH_MODE is set to M_MESH M_DEFAULT Same as M_INFINITE. M_INFINITE Specifies no distance constraint. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the neighborhood distance limit, in world units. M_NEIGHBORHOOD_ORGANIZED_SIZE Sets the neighborhood size when finding the neighbors of a point in an organized point cloud. The size determines the number of elements along a row or column of the 2D buffer of the range and confidence components. For example, if you set M_NEIGHBORHOOD_ORGANIZED_SIZE to 7, the neighborhood is a 7-element by 7-element region in the source container's 2D grid organization (specifically, in the organized point cloud's M_COMPONENT_RANGE and M_COMPONENT_CONFIDENCE components). Normal calculations for points close to the edge of the 2D buffer use a clipped neighborhood. This control type is supported only when using an organized point cloud and only if M_NEIGHBOR_SEARCH_MODE is set to M_ORGANIZED. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 7. Value &gt;= 3 Specifies the organized neighborhood size, in number of pixels; the specified value must be an odd number. Outliers context ID Specifies an outliers 3D image processing context, allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_OUTLIERS_CONTEXT, and used in M3dimOutliers() operations. M_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD_MODE Sets the threshold mode for a local distance operation. The specified mode establishes how to define the cutoff point (threshold) for determining which points are outliers, from a local average distance distribution across all points in the point cloud. A local average distance is the average distance of a point to other points in its neighborhood. To affect the threshold itself, set a scale factor with M_STD_DEVIATION_FACTOR. This control type is supported only when M_OUTLIER_MODE is set to M_LOCAL_DISTANCE. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ROBUST_STD_DEVIATION. M_ROBUST_STD_DEVIATION Specifies to determine outliers using a threshold based on the median and the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the local average distance distribution of points in the point cloud. This mode is more robust to extreme outliers. Since such outliers can skew the mean, using the median is often a more accurate middle value. M_STD_DEVIATION Specifies to determine outliers using a threshold based on the mean and the standard deviation of the local average distance distribution. M_MINIMUM_NUMBER_NEIGHBORS Sets the minimum number of neighbors that a point must have to be considered an inlier, within the distance that defines the neighborhood. The neighborhood distance is either user-defined or automatically set, depending on the M_NEIGHBORHOOD_DISTANCE_MODE setting. This control type is supported only when M_OUTLIER_MODE is set to M_NUMBER_WITHIN_DISTANCE. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 7. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the minimum number of neighbors. M_NEIGHBOR_SEARCH_MODE Sets the search mode for finding the neighbors of a point. M_DEFAULT Same as M_TREE. M_ORGANIZED Specifies to use the point cloud's organizational structure to determine the neighbors of a point. This option is supported only for an organized point cloud. M_TREE Specifies to use a KD tree search mode to determine a point's neighbors. M_NEIGHBORHOOD_DISTANCE Sets the distance that defines the neighborhood of a point; only points within this distance are considered for outlier calculations. This control type is supported only when M_OUTLIER_MODE is set to M_NUMBER_WITHIN_DISTANCE and M_NEIGHBORHOOD_DISTANCE_MODE is set to M_USER_DEFINED. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the distance. M_NEIGHBORHOOD_DISTANCE_METRIC Sets how to establish the neighborhood of a point, either as a spherical volume around the point (M_EUCLIDEAN), or as a distance in the Z-direction (M_DIRECTION_Z). To set the distance limit of the neighborhood, use M_NEIGHBORHOOD_DISTANCE. This control type is supported only when M_OUTLIER_MODE is set to M_NUMBER_WITHIN_DISTANCE. M_DEFAULT Same as M_EUCLIDEAN. M_DIRECTION_Z Specifies to use a distance in the Z-direction. This option is supported only when M_NEIGHBOR_SEARCH_MODE is set to M_ORGANIZED. M_EUCLIDEAN Specifies to use a Euclidean distance. M_NEIGHBORHOOD_DISTANCE_MODE Sets the mode for computing a point's neighborhood distance. This control type is supported only when M_OUTLIER_MODE is set to M_NUMBER_WITHIN_DISTANCE. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_AUTO Specifies to automatically compute the neighborhood distance. M_USER_DEFINED Specifies to use the distance set with M_NEIGHBORHOOD_DISTANCE. M_NEIGHBORHOOD_ORGANIZED_SIZE Sets the neighborhood size when finding the neighbors of a point in an organized point cloud. The size determines the number of elements along a row or column of the 2D buffer of the range and confidence components. For example, if you set M_NEIGHBORHOOD_ORGANIZED_SIZE to 7, the neighborhood is a 7-element by 7-element region in the source container's 2D grid organization (specifically, in the organized point cloud's M_COMPONENT_RANGE and M_COMPONENT_CONFIDENCE components). This control type is supported only when using an organized point cloud and only if M_NEIGHBOR_SEARCH_MODE is set to M_ORGANIZED. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 7. Value &gt;= 3 Specifies the organized neighborhood size, in number of pixels; the specified value must be an odd number. M_NUMBER_NEIGHBORS Sets the number of neighboring points used to calculate a point's local average distance distribution. This control type is supported only when M_OUTLIER_MODE is set to M_LOCAL_DISTANCE or M_LOCAL_DENSITY_PROBABILITY. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 30. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the number of neighbors. M_OUTLIER_MODE Sets the mode for determining whether a point is an outlier. M_DEFAULT Same as M_LOCAL_DISTANCE. M_LOCAL_DENSITY_PROBABILITY Specifies to use the density of neighboring points and a probability calculation to determine whether a point is an outlier. With this mode, an outlier probability (Poutlier_i ) is assigned to each point, based on the local density of its neighborhood. This probability is then compared to a local outlier threshold (below). If a point's local outlier probability is larger than the calculated local outlier threshold, it is considered an outlier. Poutlier_i &gt; scale_factor * [local_avg_distance_i / mean(local_avg_distance)]. The local outlier threshold calculation incorporates a point's local average distance to its neighbors (local_avg_distance_i) divided by the mean local average distance calculated from all points (mean(local_avg_distance)), all multiplied by a scale factor. Set the scale factor with M_PROBABILITY_THRESHOLD_FACTOR. A smaller scale factor rejects more outliers. This mode is useful when point cloud density is variable. For example, if your point cloud has a sparsely populated region (compared to the whole point cloud), other outlier modes might reject points in that region. Using M_LOCAL_DENSITY_PROBABILITY can reduce this risk. M_LOCAL_DISTANCE Specifies to use a statistical calculation that considers the average distance of a point to other points in its neighborhood to determine whether the point is an outlier. With this mode, a point is deemed an outlier if its average distance to neighboring points is greater than a calculated threshold. The threshold is a function of the mean or median, the standard deviation or the MAD, and the scale factor. Set the number of neighboring points to consider with M_NUMBER_NEIGHBORS. Set the threshold mode and a scale factor for the calculation with M_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD_MODE and M_STD_DEVIATION_FACTOR, respectively. M_NUMBER_WITHIN_DISTANCE Specifies to use the number of points within a defined neighborhood to determine whether a point is an outlier. With this mode, if the number of neighboring points is less than M_MINIMUM_NUMBER_NEIGHBORS, it is considered an outlier. Use M_NEIGHBORHOOD_DISTANCE_METRIC to set either a spherical neighborhood (M_EUCLIDEAN) or one defined along Z (M_DIRECTION_Z). Define the limits of the neighborhood with M_NEIGHBORHOOD_DISTANCE. This is typically the fastest outlier mode. M_PROBABILITY_THRESHOLD_FACTOR Sets the scale factor to use in the probability calculation that determines whether a point is an outlier, when working in the M_LOCAL_DENSITY_PROBABILITY outlier mode. A smaller scale factor rejects more outliers. This control type is supported only when M_OUTLIER_MODE is set to M_LOCAL_DENSITY_PROBABILITY. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.4. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the scale factor. M_STD_DEVIATION_FACTOR Sets the scale factor to use when calculating the local outlier threshold, when working in the M_LOCAL_DISTANCE outlier mode. When M_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD_MODE is set to M_STD_DEVIATION, M_STD_DEVIATION_FACTOR is the factor multiplying the standard deviation of the local average distance distribution. To illustrate, if, in the M_STD_DEVIATION mode, the mean local average distance is 1.0, the standard deviation is 0.3, and M_STD_DEVIATION_FACTOR is set to 3.0, then MIL calculates the local outlier threshold as follows: mean + std_deviation_factor * standard_deviation = 1.0 + 3.0 * 0.3 = 1.9. For this example, points with local average distances larger than 1.9 are considered outliers. When M_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD_MODE is set to M_ROBUST_STD_DEVIATION, M_STD_DEVIATION_FACTOR is the factor multiplying the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the local average distance distribution. For either mode, a smaller factor defines a smaller threshold, thereby more aggressively rejecting outliers. This control type is supported only when M_OUTLIER_MODE is set to M_LOCAL_DISTANCE. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 3.0. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the scale factor. Profile context ID Specifies a profile 3D image processing context, allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_PROFILE_CONTEXT, and used in M3dimProfileEx() operations. M_PROFILE_ACCUMULATE_TYPE Sets how to determine the pixel value when multiple points correspond to the same destination pixel. M_DEFAULT Same as M_MEAN. M_MAX Specifies to use the largest value of all the points corresponding to a single destination pixel. This option is not supported when M_PROFILE_INTERPOLATION_MODE is set to M_AVERAGE. M_MEAN Specifies to use the mean value of all the points corresponding to a single destination pixel. M_MIN Specifies to use the smallest value of all the points corresponding to a single destination pixel. This option is not supported when M_PROFILE_INTERPOLATION_MODE is set to M_AVERAGE. M_PROFILE_INTERPOLATION_AVERAGE_FRACTION Sets the fraction of the sampling distance to use when taking a weighted average of the area surrounding the source point. For example, a value of 0.5 indicates that 50 percent of the pixel area that surrounds the source point (defined by 50% of the sampling distance along the line) is used to calculate a weighted average for the source point. This control type is only available when M_PROFILE_INTERPOLATION_MODE is set to M_AVERAGE. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. 0.0 &lt; Value &lt;= 1.0 Specifies the fraction. M_PROFILE_INTERPOLATION_MODE Sets the interpolation mode used to calculate the value of the destination pixel when multiple source points correspond to a profile point. M_DEFAULT Same as M_BILINEAR. M_AVERAGE Specifies averaging interpolation. The new value is determined by taking a weighted average of the pixel area that surrounds the source point. You can use M_PROFILE_INTERPOLATION_AVERAGE_FRACTION to specify how much of the pixel area to consider. M_BILINEAR Specifies bilinear interpolation. The new value is determined by taking a weighted average of the 4 values (2x2) that surround the source point. M_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR Specifies nearest neighbor interpolation. The new value is that of the pixel closest to the source point. M_PROFILE_MIN_VALID_PERCENTAGE Sets the minimum percentage of corresponding points that must be valid to set the destination pixel to a valid value. When more than one source point corresponds to a destination pixel, the destination pixel will be invalid if the minimum valid percentage is not met. Note that if results are stored in a profile 3D image processing result buffer, invalid points are not included in the profile. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the percentage of corresponding points. Note that a value of 0.0% means there are no constraints on the number of valid points, but if all points contributing to the calculation of a point are invalid, the point in the destination will be invalid. M_PROFILE_SAMPLE_SIZE Sets the sampling distance between two consecutive points along the slicing plane. When the pixel size in X is not equal to the pixel size in Y in the source depth map, this ensures the extracted points are at a uniform distance. Note that this will be the destination pixel size of the profile. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the distance. Use M_PROFILE_SAMPLE_SIZE_MODE to specify how to interpret the specified sampling distance. M_PROFILE_SAMPLE_SIZE_MODE Sets how to interpret the specified sampling distance (M_PROFILE_SAMPLE_SIZE). M_DEFAULT Same as M_RELATIVE_TO_PIXEL_SIZE_MIN. M_RELATIVE_TO_PIXEL_SIZE_MAX Specifies to multiply the sampling distance by the pixel size in X or in Y, depending on which is bigger. M_RELATIVE_TO_PIXEL_SIZE_MIN Specifies to multiply the sampling distance by the pixel size in X or in Y, depending on which is smaller. M_RELATIVE_TO_PIXEL_SIZE_X Specifies to multiply the sampling distance by the pixel size in X. For example, if you set M_PROFILE_SAMPLE_SIZE to 2.0 and the pixel size in X is 0.5 mm, the sampling distance will be 1.0 mm. M_RELATIVE_TO_PIXEL_SIZE_Y Specifies to multiply the sampling distance by the pixel size in Y. For example, if you set M_PROFILE_SAMPLE_SIZE to 2.0 and the pixel size in Y is 0.6 mm, the sampling distance will be 1.2 mm. M_WORLD Specifies that the sampling distance be interpreted in world units. For example, if you set M_PROFILE_SAMPLE_SIZE to 2.0, the sampling distance will be 2.0 world units. M_PROFILE_THICKNESS Sets the thickness of the profile line (slicing plane). Pixels along the line, within the specified thickness, are sampled and corresponding points are considered for the profile. Note that a thick profile line typically results in multiple source points corresponding to the same destination pixel. You can use M_PROFILE_ACCUMULATE_TYPE to determine which of the points are included in the profile. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the thickness. Use M_PROFILE_THICKNESS_MODE to specify how to interpret the specified thickness. M_PROFILE_THICKNESS_MODE Sets how to interpret the specified thickness value (M_PROFILE_THICKNESS). M_DEFAULT Same as M_RELATIVE_TO_PIXEL_SIZE_X. M_RELATIVE_TO_PIXEL_SIZE_MAX Specifies to multiply the thickness value by the pixel size in X or in Y, depending on which is bigger. M_RELATIVE_TO_PIXEL_SIZE_MIN Specifies to multiply the thickness value by the pixel size in X or in Y, depending on which is smaller. M_RELATIVE_TO_PIXEL_SIZE_X Specifies to multiply the thickness value by the pixel size in X. For example, if you set M_PROFILE_THICKNESS to 2.0 and the pixel size in X is 0.5 mm, the profile line will be 1.0 mm thick. M_RELATIVE_TO_PIXEL_SIZE_Y Specifies to multiply the thickness value by the pixel size in Y. For example, if you set M_PROFILE_THICKNESS to 2.0 and the pixel size in Y is 0.6 mm, the profile line will be 1.2 mm thick. M_WORLD Specifies that the thickness value be interpreted in world units. For example, if you set M_PROFILE_THICKNESS to 2.0, the profile line will be 2.0 world units thick. Remap context ID Specifies a remap 3D image processing context, allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_REMAP_CONTEXT, and used in M3dimRemapDepthMap() operations. M_DIRECTION_Z Sets the sign of the Z-scale in the destination depth map. The sign applies to M_GRAY_LEVEL_SIZE_Z, which sets the length, in world units, of one gray level in a fully-corrected depth map. Note that when M_REMAP_MODE is set to M_USE_DESTINATION_CALIBRATION, this control type has no effect. M_DEFAULT Same as M_SAME. M_NEGATIVE Specifies a negative value for the Z-scale. A negative value indicates that larger Z-values are represented by darker depth map pixels, and smaller Z-values are represented by brighter depth map pixels. M_POSITIVE Specifies a positive value for the Z-scale. A positive value indicates that larger Z-values are represented by brighter depth map pixels, and smaller Z-values are represented by darker depth map pixels.

M_DATA_EXTREMES Specifies to remap the source depth map using its maximum and minimum pixel values to define the destination's Z-range. M_GAUSSIAN Specifies to remap the source depth map using a specified number of standard deviations from the mean Z-value to define the destination's Z-range.

M_USE_DESTINATION_CALIBRATION Specifies to remap the source depth map using the destination image buffer's calibration information to define the destination's Z-range. M_USER_DEFINED Specifies to remap the source depth map using custom values to define the destination's Z range; use M_MAX_Z and M_MIN_Z to set the range. M_STANDARD_DEVIATION_FACTOR Sets the standard deviation factor, for when M_REMAP_MODE is set to M_GAUSSIAN. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 2.0. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the standard deviation factor. Statistics context ID Specifies a statistics 3D image processing context, allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_STATISTICS_CONTEXT, and used in M3dimStat() operations. M_BOUNDING_BOX Sets whether to enable bounding box statistics calculations. The bounding box is an axis-aligned or semi-oriented box that contains all or most of the points in the 3D scene, or it encloses a 3D geometry object. To compute a bounding box (for a point cloud or depth map) that contains most of the valid points instead of all of them, set M_BOUNDING_BOX_ALGORITHM to M_ROBUST. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to disable bounding box calculations. M_ENABLE Specifies to enable bounding box calculations. M_BOUNDING_BOX_ALGORITHM Sets the algorithm to use when bounding box calculations have been enabled (M_BOUNDING_BOX). The default setting (M_ALL_POINTS) includes all valid points; no valid points exist outside the bounding box. Invalid points can exist inside or outside the bounding box. This setting is not available for 3D geometries. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ALL_POINTS. M_ALL_POINTS Specifies to compute the axis-aligned bounding box that contains all the valid points. M_ROBUST Specifies to compute an axis-aligned box that contains most of the points, but rejects outliers. M_BOUNDING_BOX_OUTLIER_RATIO_X Sets the fraction of points to exclude from the bounding box, based on X-coordinates. A point is excluded when its X-coordinate places the point in an outlier position, and therefore outside the bounding box. The specified value is a decimal fraction between 0.0 and 1.0. For example, if set to 0.01, the furthest 1% of points along X are excluded. Set this control type when bounding box calculations have been enabled (M_BOUNDING_BOX) and M_BOUNDING_BOX_ALGORITHM is set to M_ROBUST. This setting is not available for 3D geometries. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.002. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt; 1.0 Specifies the fraction. M_BOUNDING_BOX_OUTLIER_RATIO_Y Sets the fraction of points to exclude from the bounding box, based on Y-coordinates. A point is excluded when its Y-coordinate places the point in an outlier position, and therefore outside the bounding box. The specified value is a decimal fraction between 0.0 and 1.0.

Set this control type when bounding box calculations have been enabled (M_BOUNDING_BOX) and M_BOUNDING_BOX_ALGORITHM is set to M_ROBUST. This setting is not available for 3D geometries. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.002. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt; 1.0 Specifies the fraction. M_BOUNDING_BOX_OUTLIER_RATIO_Z Sets the fraction of points to exclude from the bounding box, based on Z-coordinates. A point is excluded when its Z-coordinate places the point in an outlier position, and therefore outside the bounding box. The specified value is a decimal fraction between 0.0 and 1.0. For example, if set to 0.01, the furthest 1% of points along Z are excluded. Set this option when bounding box calculations have been enabled (M_BOUNDING_BOX) and when M_BOUNDING_BOX_ALGORITHM is set to M_ROBUST. This setting is not available for 3D geometries. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.010. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt; 1.0 Specifies the fraction. M_BOX_ORIENTATION Sets whether to compute an axis-aligned or semi-oriented bounding box. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AXIS_ALIGNED. M_AXIS_ALIGNED Specifies to compute the minimum volume axis-aligned bounding box. M_SEMI_ORIENTED Specifies to compute the minimum volume bounding box that is, by default, axis-aligned in Z but not in X and Y.

M_BOX_SEMI_ORIENTED_ROTATION_AXIS Sets the axis with which to align the semi-oriented bounding box, when M_BOX_ORIENTATION is set to M_SEMI_ORIENTED. The minimum volume bounding box is computed such that it is aligned with the specified axis and not constrained by the other two axes. This affects the plane to which the semi-oriented bounding box is parallel. For example, if you set this control type to M_AXIS_X, the semi-oriented bounding box will be axis-aligned in X and parallel to the YZ-plane. This control type is only used when M_BOX_ORIENTATION is set to M_SEMI_ORIENTED. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AXIS_Z. M_AXIS_X Specifies to align the semi-oriented bounding box with the X-axis.

Centroid statistics include the X-, Y-, and Z-coordinates of the centroid. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to disable centroid calculations. M_ENABLE Specifies to enable centroid calculations. M_COMPONENT_OF_INTEREST Sets the component for which to calculate statistics, when computing statistics on a point cloud. M_DEFAULT Same as M_COMPONENT_RANGE. M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL Specifies to calculate the statistics on the normals component. Note that surface variation, aspect ratio, number-of-valid-neighbors, bounding box, and nearest-neighbor statistics are not supported on the normals component, and will generate an error. M_COMPONENT_RANGE Specifies to calculate the statistics on the range component. M_DISTANCE_TO_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR Sets whether to enable distance-to-nearest-neighbor statistics calculations. Distance-to-nearest-neighbor statistics include the average distance, the maximum distance, and the minimum distance of 3D points or real world coordinates to their nearest neighbor. Note that distance-to-nearest-neighbor statistics are not available for 3D geometries. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to disable distance-to-nearest-neighbor calculations. M_ENABLE Specifies to enable distance-to-nearest-neighbor calculations. M_MAX_DISTANCE Sets the maximum distance from a point within which other points are considered its neighbors when calculating distance-to-nearest-neighbor, surface variation, aspect ratio, and number-of-valid-neighbors statistics. M_DEFAULT Same as M_INFINITE. M_INFINITE Specifies that there is no maximum distance. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the maximum distance. M_MAXIMUM_NUMBER_NEIGHBORS Sets the maximum number of neighbors to consider when calculating distance-to-nearest-neighbor, surface variation, aspect ratio, and number-of-valid-neighbors statistics. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 49. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the maximum number of neighbors. M_MOMENT_ORDER Sets the order up to which moments are calculated. For example, setting this to 3 will calculate third order moments, but also second and first order moments. Note that there are (N+1)(N+2)/2 moments for order N. For example, if M_MOMENT_ORDER is set to 3, the number of computed moments are 10, 6, and 3 for third, second, and first order moments, respectively. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 2. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 15 Specifies the moment order. M_MOMENTS Sets whether to enable moments statistics calculations.

M_DEFAULT Same as M_TREE. M_AUTO Specifies to automatically set the search mode based on the point cloud's organization, either M_ORGANIZED if organized or M_TREE if unorganized. M_ORGANIZED Specifies to use the point cloud's organizational structure to determine the neighbors of a point. This option is supported only for an organized point cloud. M_TREE Specifies to use a KD tree search mode to determine a point's neighbors. M_NEIGHBORHOOD_ASPECT_RATIO Sets whether to enable local aspect ratio statistics calculations. For each point, MIL fits a local plane to neighboring points and determines that plane's aspect ratio. The aspect ratio is calculated by dividing the central point's distance to its closest neighbor along one axis by the distance to its closest neighbor along the other axis. Local aspect ratio statistics describe how skewed the point density is in one direction compared to the other. You typically do not want an aspect ratio higher than 5. Neighborhood-based functions do not benefit from the point cloud being denser in only one direction. In the worst case, a neighborhood with only a single row of points will produce faulty results. You can use M3dimSample() to subsample the point cloud to help correct aspect ratios that are too high. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to disable local aspect ratio calculations. M_ENABLE Specifies to enable local aspect ratio calculations. M_NEIGHBORHOOD_ASPECT_RATIO_CLIPPING_VALUE Sets the maximum value of the neighborhood aspect ratio, to avoid skewed statistics. For example, a neighborhood that looks like a line might have an infinite aspect ratio, which will disproportionately affect statistics such as M_NEIGHBORHOOD_ASPECT_RATIO_AVERAGE and M_NEIGHBORHOOD_ASPECT_RATIO_STDEV. To avoid this, it can be clipped to a maximum value using this control. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 100.0. This means that when the aspect ratio exceeds 100:1 (that is, 100 times more points in one direction), the aspect ratio will be clipped to 100 in statistic calculations. Value &gt; 1.0 Specifies the maximum value. M_NEIGHBORHOOD_HEALTHY_THRESHOLD Sets the minimum number of neighbors that constitute a healthy neighborhood for the M_NEIGHBORHOOD_HEALTHY_PERCENTAGE result type (M3dimGetResult()). Most neighborhood-based functions (for example, M3dimNormals()) will work poorly if the percentage of points with a healthy neighborhood is too low. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 7. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the number of neighbors. M_NEIGHBORHOOD_ORGANIZED_SIZE Sets the neighborhood size when finding the neighbors of a point in an organized point cloud for distance-to-nearest-neighbor, surface variation, aspect ratio, and number-of-valid-neighbors calculations. The size determines the number of elements along a row or column of the 2D buffer of the range and confidence components. For example, if you set M_NEIGHBORHOOD_ORGANIZED_SIZE to 7, the neighborhood is a 7-element by 7-element region in the source container's 2D grid organization (specifically, in the organized point cloud's M_COMPONENT_RANGE and M_COMPONENT_CONFIDENCE components). This control type is supported only when using an organized point cloud and only if M_NEIGHBOR_SEARCH_MODE is set to M_ORGANIZED. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 7. Value &gt;= 3 Specifies the organized neighborhood size, in number of pixels; the specified value must be an odd number. M_NORMALIZATION_MODE Sets whether the normalization matrix should transform the point cloud or 3D geometry to fit a signed (M_NORMALIZE_SIGNED) or unsigned (M_NORMALIZE_UNSIGNED) unit box. A signed unit box has a maximum length of 2 (stretches from -1 to +1 along at least one dimension) and is centered at (0,0,0). An unsigned unit box has a maximum length of 1 (stretches from 0 to +1 along at least one dimension) and is centered at (0.5,0.5,0.5). M_DEFAULT Same as M_NORMALIZE_UNSIGNED. M_NORMALIZE_SIGNED Specifies to transform the point cloud or 3D geometry to fit a signed unit box. M_NORMALIZE_UNSIGNED Specifies to transform the point cloud or 3D geometry to fit an unsigned unit box. M_NORMALIZATION_SCALE Sets how to apply scale values when transforming the point cloud or 3D geometry to fit a unit box. If set to M_UNIFORM, each dimension is scaled using the same value such that the largest dimension fits the unit box, and the remaining dimensions will have the same or smaller lengths. If set to M_NON_UNIFORM, scale values are applied such that all dimensions have the same length and fit a unit cube. A normalization matrix computed using non-uniform scaling cannot be applied to 3D geometries of type M_SPHERE or M_BOX. M_DEFAULT Same as M_UNIFORM. M_NON_UNIFORM Applies scale values so that the transformed point cloud or 3D geometry occupies a unit cube. M_UNIFORM Applies the same scale value to all dimensions. M_NUMBER_OF_POINTS Sets whether to enable number-of-points statistics calculations.

M_ENABLE Specifies to enable number-of-points calculations. M_NUMBER_OF_SAMPLES Sets the number of sample points to use when calculating distance-to-nearest-neighbor, surface variation, aspect ratio, and number-of-valid-neighbors statistics. By default, MIL uses all points for the calculation. However, if speed is an issue, you can try specifying a fraction of the total points, which could yield a satisfactory approximate calculation. M_DEFAULT Same as M_INFINITE. M_INFINITE Specifies to use all points when calculating distance-to-nearest-neighbor and surface variation statistics. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the number of sample points to use when calculating distance-to-nearest-neighbor and surface variation statistics. If the specified value is greater than the number of valid points, all points are used. M_NUMBER_OF_VALID_NEIGHBORS Sets whether to enable number-of-valid-neighbors statistics calculations. Number-of-valid-neighbors statistics allow you to check for degenerate neighborhoods, which negatively affect neighborhood-based functions (for example, M3dimNormals()). M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to disable number-of-valid-neighbors calculations. M_ENABLE Specifies to enable number-of-valid-neighbors calculations. M_PCA Sets whether to enable principal component analysis (PCA) statistics calculations. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to disable PCA calculations. M_ENABLE Specifies to enable PCA calculations. M_PCA_MODE Sets whether to calculate the principal component analysis (PCA) around the origin (M_ORDINARY) or around the centroid (M_CENTRAL).

Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the size of the depth map in Y, in world units. M_STATIC_INDEX Sets the source depth map to which all other depth map pixels will be stitched. For example, if depth maps 1 and 2's pixel size=1, depth map 1 starts at world x=3, and depth map 2 starts at world x=5.25, depth map 2 will be stitched to the nearest depth map 1 pixel, such that the intensity values of the destination pixels at world x=5 and world x=6 will be those of the source pixels at world x=5.25 and world x=6.25, or their intensity values will be interpolated (depending on the value of M_STITCH_MODE). M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to use the first depth map in the array. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the index of the depth map to use. This value must be less than the value passed to the NumContainers parameter of M3dimMerge(). M_STITCH_DIRECTION Sets the direction in which to stitch the point clouds' component values. Note that stitching does not depend on the coordinates of points. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DIRECTION_Y.

Interpolation is done to accurately align the depth maps when stitching them. Subsample context ID Specifies a subsample 3D image processing context, allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_SUBSAMPLE_CONTEXT, and used in M3dimSample() subsampling operations. You can set the type of subsampling operation to perform with M_SUBSAMPLE_MODE.

M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the step interval value. M_SUBSAMPLE_MODE Sets the type of subsampling operation to perform. M_DEFAULT Same as M_SUBSAMPLE_DECIMATE. M_SUBSAMPLE_DECIMATE Specifies to subsample using a decimation operation, which selects points at regular intervals. Set the interval size with M_STEP_SIZE_X and M_STEP_SIZE_Y. You can set the resulting subsampled point cloud's organizational type with M_ORGANIZATION_TYPE. Note that M_SUBSAMPLE_DECIMATE can sometimes generate undesirable regular patterns. To avoid such patterns, use random mode (M_SUBSAMPLE_RANDOM) instead. M_SUBSAMPLE_GEOMETRIC Specifies to perform a geometrically stable subsampling, which selects points that help 3D registration converge faster and avoid local minima. The underlying algorithm identifies and rejects points that are likely to cause registration to slide away from convergence, while retaining points that constrain rotational and translational transforms during registration. You can set the fraction of points that are retained from the source point cloud with M_FRACTION_OF_POINTS. M_SUBSAMPLE_GRID Specifies to subsample using a grid operation, which divides the 3D space into cells and, for each subgroup of points, selects a single point per cell.

Note that, when M_ORGANIZATION_TYPE is set to M_ORGANIZED, exactly 1 of M_GRID_SIZE_X, M_GRID_SIZE_Y, or M_GRID_SIZE_Z must be set to M_INFINITE. When M_ORGANIZATION_TYPE is set to M_UNORGANIZED, you can set at most 1 of M_GRID_SIZE_... to M_INFINITE. When one of M_GRID_SIZE_... is set to M_INFINITE, the point selected for a cell depends on the mode specified with M_POINT_SELECTED. When none of M_GRID_SIZE_... is set to M_INFINITE, the point selected for a cell is the point closest to the cell's volumetric center. M_SUBSAMPLE_NORMAL Specifies to subsample based on normal vector angles and a neighborhood distance.

M_FIXTURING_MATRIX Specifies to copy, into the transformation matrix, principal component analysis (PCA) statistics results that can bring points along the object's principal axes to the X-, Y-, and Z-axes. This matrix is the inverse of the PCA matrix (M_PCA_MATRIX).

The transformation matrix object must have been previously allocated using M3dgeoAlloc() with M_TRANSFORMATION_MATRIX. M_NORMALIZATION_MATRIX Specifies to copy, into the transformation matrix, bounding box statistics results that can transform the bounding box into a unit box. The unit box's maximum length is 1, except in the case of a signed unit box, whose maximum length is 2. Use M3dimControl() with M_NORMALIZATION_MODE to specify whether the transformed point cloud or 3D geometry should fit a signed or unsigned unit box. When M_NORMALIZATION_MODE is set to M_NORMALIZE_SIGNED, the unit box of the transformed cloud is signed, centered at (0,0,0), and its unit length is at most 2 (stretches from -1 to +1). When M_NORMALIZATION_MODE is set to M_NORMALIZE_UNSIGNED, the unit box of the transformed cloud is unsigned, centered at (0.5,0.5,0.5), and its unit length is at most 1 (stretches from 0 to +1). When M_NORMALIZATION_SCALE is set to M_UNIFORM, the same scale factor is applied to all dimensions. This means that the largest dimension is scaled to fit the unit box, and the remaining dimensions will have the same or smaller lengths. When M_NORMALIZATION_SCALE is set to M_NON_UNIFORM, a different scale factor is applied along each dimension and the resulting box is a unit cube. This copy operation is not available for a semi-oriented bounding box. Transformation matrix object ID in which to copy Specifies the identifier of the transformation matrix object in which to copy the bounding box statistics results. The transformation matrix object must have been previously allocated using M3dgeoAlloc() with M_TRANSFORMATION_MATRIX. M_PCA_MATRIX Specifies to copy, into the transformation matrix, PCA statistics results that can bring points on the X-, Y-, and Z-axes to the object's principal axes. If M_PCA_MODE is set to M_CENTRAL, the matrix contains a translation and rotation to the centroid; otherwise, it is a pure rotation. The centroid is that of the original depth map or point cloud from which the statistics were calculated. If the source was a point cloud, it is the centroid of the points or the points' unit normal vectors, depending on whether the statistics were calculated on the range or normals component, respectively. Transformation matrix object ID in which to copy Specifies the identifier of the transformation matrix object in which to copy the principal component analysis (PCA) statistics results. The transformation matrix object must have been previously allocated using M3dgeoAlloc() with M_TRANSFORMATION_MATRIX.

If M_PCA_MODE is set to M_CENTRAL, the line starts at the centroid; otherwise, it starts at the origin. The centroid is that of the original depth map or point cloud from which the statistics were calculated.

M_PRINCIPAL_AXIS_2 Specifies to copy PCA statistics results into the specified 3D geometry object, establishing a 3D line geometry; the line marks the second principal axis and has a length of 1 unit. If M_PCA_MODE is set to M_CENTRAL, the line starts at the centroid; otherwise, it starts at the origin. The centroid is that of the original depth map or point cloud from which the statistics were calculated. If the source was a point cloud, it is the centroid of the points or the points' unit normal vectors, depending on whether the statistics were calculated on the range or normals component, respectively. 3D geometry object ID in which to copy Specifies the identifier of a 3D geometry object in which to copy the statistics results. The 3D geometry object must have been previously allocated using M3dgeoAlloc() with M_GEOMETRY.

M_PRINCIPAL_AXIS_3 Specifies to copy PCA statistics results into the specified 3D geometry object, establishing a 3D line geometry; the line marks the third principal axis and has a length of 1 unit. If M_PCA_MODE is set to M_CENTRAL, the line starts at the centroid; otherwise, it starts at the origin. The centroid is that of the original depth map or point cloud from which the statistics were calculated. If the source was a point cloud, it is the centroid of the points or the points' unit normal vectors, depending on whether the statistics were calculated on the range or normals component, respectively. 3D geometry object ID in which to copy Specifies the identifier of a 3D geometry object in which to copy the statistics results. The 3D geometry object must have been previously allocated using M3dgeoAlloc() with M_GEOMETRY. Note that, after calling M3dimCopyResult(), the destination 3D geometry object will return type M_LINE if inquired using M3dgeoInquire() with M_GEOMETRY_TYPE. M_STANDARDIZATION_MATRIX Specifies to copy, into the transformation matrix, moments statistics results that can scale the point cloud to dimensions at or near one unit. This means that the centroid is positioned at (0,0,0) and the point cloud is transformed so that it has unit variance along each axis. Therefore, on average, each point's X-coordinate will be one unit away from the origin, and similarly for each Y- and Z-coordinate. Note that the moments results must be of order 2 or greater. To transform the point cloud to fit inside a unit box, copy bounding box statistic results using M_NORMALIZATION_MATRIX. Transformation matrix object ID in which to copy Specifies the identifier of the transformation matrix object in which to copy the moments statistics results. The transformation matrix object must have been previously allocated using M3dgeoAlloc() with M_TRANSFORMATION_MATRIX. Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; mil3dim.lib.

Syntax void M3dimCrop( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcContainerBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstContainerBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;ImageBufOrGeometry3dgeoId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;Matrix3dgeoId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;OrganizationType, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function crops 3D points in the source container's point cloud, based on a specified 3D geometry mask or image buffer. You can optionally specify a transformation matrix to fixture the source point cloud before the cropping operation. Source components are copied into the destination container where the destination's confidence component determines a point's viability after the crop operation. Specifically, rejected points (those cropped out) are assigned a 0 confidence value in the destination confidence component. Corresponding points in the destination range component are considered cropped out. Note that normals and reflectance (or intensity) components are not required, but the crop operation is applied to these components if they are present in the source container. If the crop is based on a 3D geometry, the default operation keeps points located inside the specified geometry, rejecting all others. If the crop is based on an image buffer, the mask is applied differently based on the type of image buffer: When using an uncalibrated image buffer, points are mapped to the same location in the mask image buffer as the point's location in the range component of its point cloud container. When using a uniformly calibrated image buffer, points are projected orthogonally onto the mask. When using a 3D-based calibrated image buffer, points are projected onto the mask following the frustum of the camera's view, as represented by the associated camera calibration information. Points are kept only if they correspond to non-zero pixels in the mask image buffer; any points corresponding to zero pixels are rejected. Note that you can specify to invert the crop operation (for example, to keep points located outside, instead of inside, the specified geometry). For more information on how different image buffers can affect how the crop is performed, see the the Cropping using a mask image subsection of the Working with points in a point cloud section of Chapter 35: 3D image processing. You can specify how the destination container is organized (for example, as an unorganized point cloud). If a mesh component exists in the source point cloud container, it is also affected by the crop operation. Any cropped point that correspond to the vertex of a triangular face results in that face's removal. This can result in a hole in the mesh. Parameters Parameters SrcContainerBufId Specifies the identifier of the source container containing a 3D-processable point cloud. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE). DstContainerBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination container in which to store the resulting point cloud. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must not be a child container. Note that, if the OrganizationType parameter is set to M_UNORGANIZED and there are no valid points remaining after the crop, the destination container's range component's dimensions are reduced to 1x1 and its corresponding confidence equals 0. ImageBufOrGeometry3dgeoId Specifies the identifier of the 3D geometry object or image buffer used to crop the points. For specifying the mask Value Description M_XY_PLANE Specifies the XY (Z=0) plane. Points are kept above this plane, unless M_INVERSE is specified; see the ControlFlag parameter. MIL 3D geometry object identifier Specifies the 3D geometry object identifier. The 3D geometry object must have been previously allocated on the required system using M3dgeoAlloc() with M_GEOMETRY, and must have been successfully defined. Supported 3D geometries include box, cylinder, plane, and sphere. MIL image buffer identifier Specifies the mask image buffer. The mask must be a 1-band, 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit unsigned image buffer, and must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. You can use a calibrated or uncalibrated image buffer. When cropping using an uncalibrated image buffer, the point cloud's points are mapped to the same location in the mask image buffer as the point's location in the range component of its point cloud container. A point is not kept if it corresponds to a zero pixel in the mask. The image buffer's size in X and Y must be the same as the source container's range component. To inquire the range component's size, use MbufInquireContainer() with M_COMPONENT_RANGE, M_SIZE_X, and M_SIZE_Y. When cropping using a calibrated mask, the point cloud's points are projected onto the mask image. A point is not kept if it is projected onto a zero pixel in the mask. The projection is orthogonal for a uniformly calibrated mask. That is, world coordinate values in the point cloud correspond linearly to pixel positions in the 2D mask image onto which the point cloud is projected. If a calibrated mask image is of type M_3D_CALIBRATION, point projection is not orthogonal, but instead follows the frustum of the camera's view, as represented by the associated camera calibration information. To keep points that correspond to zero pixels and crop out the others, set the ControlFlag parameter to M_INVERSE. Matrix3dgeoId Specifies the identifier of the optional transformation matrix used to fixture the source container before applying the cropping criteria. Note that passing a transformation matrix to M3dimCrop() is the equivalent to first calling M3dimMatrixTransform(), and then calling M3dimCrop() on the resulting transformed point cloud. For specifying the identifier of a 3D geometry transformation matrix Value Description M_NULL Specifies to ignore this parameter. M_IDENTITY_MATRIX Specifies to use an identity matrix. This means that the source point cloud will not be transformed or rotated in any way before the cropping operation. Transformation matrix object identifier Specifies the identifier of a transformation matrix object, previously allocated using M3dgeoAlloc() with M_TRANSFORMATION_MATRIX. The transformation matrix must be any valid affine transformation matrix, where the last row is (0,0,0,1). That is, if you call M3dgeoInquire() with M_AFFINE, the function returns M_TRUE. OrganizationType Specifies how to organize the resulting point cloud. For specifying the organization type Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_SAME. M_SAME Specifies to copy all the source container's components into the destination container; points set to 0 in the destination confidence component indicate cropped points. M_SHRINK Specifies to copy, from source to destination, the smallest region that holds all valid points (remaining after the crop operation) in all components; points set to 0 in the destination confidence component indicate cropped points. Note that the region is a rectangular region within the bands of the 2D data buffers that hold point cloud data. M_UNORGANIZED Specifies to store results in an unorganized point cloud. Components in the destination container will store results of the crop operation in 1D, unorganized buffers. ControlFlag Specifies which points to keep, relative to the cropping object set with ImageBufOrGeometry3dgeoId. By default, the operation only affects the core components of a 3D-processable container. These core components are listed in the description of M_3D_PROCESSABLE. You can use M_APPLY_TO_ALL_COMPONENTS to apply the operation to all other components in the container, including custom components. The components must have the same dimensions as M_COMPONENT_RANGE; otherwise, they will be copied to the destination unmodified. For specifying which points to keep Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies to keep points that are inside the specified 3D geometry object, above the specified plane, or not set to 0 in the specified mask, depending on the cropping object set with ImageBufOrGeometry3dgeoId. Note that, for a plane geometry, above is in the direction of the plane normal vector. To inquire this vector, use M3dgeoInquire() with M_NORMAL_.... M_INVERSE Specifies to keep points that are outside the specified 3D geometry object, below the specified plane, or set to 0 in the specified mask, depending on the cropping object set with ImageBufOrGeometry3dgeoId. Note that, for a plane geometry, below is in the opposite direction of the plane normal vector. To inquire this vector, use M3dgeoInquire() with M_NORMAL_.... Combination value that can be used alone or as combination value for M_INVERSE. You can use the following value on its own, or add it to the above-mentioned value, to specify to apply the cropping operation to all components. For specifying to apply the cropping operation to all components Value Description M_APPLY_TO_ALL_COMPONENTS Specifies that the operation will affect the core components of a 3D-processable container, as well as any other component (including custom components) that has the same dimension as M_COMPONENT_RANGE. These components must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with them. For example, using a component that is an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Note that if a custom component has an associated calibration context, the component's information is cropped, but its calibration context is ignored and discarded. If the resulting operation yields an empty container with 0 valid points, the components with the same dimensions are not created and will not exist in the destination container.

You can choose to fill gaps with interpolated values, or propagate a boundary value across the gap. The gap filling operation is performed according to the context specified with GapFillingContext3dimId. For some applications, you can reasonably approximate gap values with an interpolation of neighboring values. In other situations, such as when the gap spans an abrupt change in depth, or the gap is very wide, you can choose to propagate one of the gap's boundary values across the gap. To specify how wide a gap to fill and other gap filling settings, use M3dimControl(). Gaps are filled in a 2-step process: first along X, and then along Y (or vice versa). For example, if you choose to fill first along the X-direction, all gaps along rows in the depth or intensity map are evaluated and filled before any columns are examined. Therefore, gaps are examined not as an X-by-Y area to be filled, but on a per-row (or column) basis. To set the mode in which to fill gaps, use M3dimControl() with M_FILL_MODE and M_X_THEN_Y or M_Y_THEN_X. Parameters Parameters GapFillingContext3dimId Specifies a fill gaps 3D image processing context. For specifying the fill gaps 3D image processing context identifier Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default fill gaps 3D image processing context of the current MIL application.

MIL fill gaps 3D image processing context identifier Specifies the identifier of a fill gaps 3D image processing context, previously allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_FILL_GAPS_CONTEXT. If a previously allocated context is specified, the function applies the fill gaps control settings specified using M3dimControl(). DepthMapImageBufId Specifies the depth map container or image buffer identifier of the depth map on which to fill gaps. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, must store data in a 3D-processable depth map format (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE), and must not be a child container. The image buffer must be an 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit unsigned, 1-band buffer, and must be 3D-corrected (that is, if you call McalInquire() with M_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE). IntensityMapImageBufId Specifies the image buffer identifier of the intensity map on which to fill gaps. The image buffer must be an 8-bit or 16-bit unsigned, 1-band or 3-band buffer. The image buffer must have the same dimensions as the buffer specified for DepthMapImageBufId (or, if DepthMapImageBufId is a depth map container, the same dimensions as the range component). If the intensity map is not required, set this parameter to M_NULL. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. Compilation information Header Include mil.h.

Syntax void M3dimFilter( MIL_ID&nbsp;FilterContext3dimId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcContainerBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstContainerBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function applies a smoothing filter to a point cloud. Filtering reduces noise by changing the positions of points, but does not eliminate them. If you want to invalidate outlier points, use M3dimOutliers(). You can choose the type of smoothing operation to perform, either bilateral or moving least squares (MLS). Use M3dimControl() with M_FILTER_MODE to set the mode. The MLS filter applies smoothing equally to surface and edge points. The bilateral filter, on the other hand, smooths points on faces, leaving edge points much less affected. The bilateral filter (M_SMOOTH_BILATERAL) uses the source point cloud's normal values. If a normals component does not already exist in the source point cloud, M3dimFilter() will calculate point normals and create a normals component, adding it to the destination container. In this case, use M3dimControl() with M_USE_SOURCE_NORMALS set to M_FALSE. Note that this is more efficient than separately calculating a normals component using M3dimNormals(). Nevertheless, the method used for computing normals could improve filter results. For more information, see the Smoothing a point cloud subsection of the Working with points in a point cloud section of Chapter 35: 3D image processing. Parameters Parameters FilterContext3dimId Specifies a filter 3D image processing context. For specifying the filter 3D image processing context identifier Value Description MIL filter 3D image processing context identifier Specifies the identifier of a filter 3D image processing context, previously allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_FILTER_CONTEXT. The function applies the filter control settings specified using M3dimControl(). SrcContainerBufId Specifies the identifier of the 3D-processable point cloud container to use as the source. The container must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE). The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC.

Syntax void M3dimFindTransformation( MIL_ID&nbsp;FindTransformationContext3dimId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SourceContainerOrArrayBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;TargetContainerOrArrayBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;Result3dimOrMatrix3dgeoId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function finds the rigid or affine transformation between the source and target sets of points. MIL finds the transformation matrix A such that A * source (as per M3dimMatrixTransform()) best approximates the target. Specifically, the transformation minimizes the squared error between pairs of points. Source[x, y] is compared with Target[x, y]. Accordingly, this function works only when you know a specific pairing between the source and target points (for example, through feature extraction). For a function that finds an alignment but does not require an exact pairing, see M3dregCalculate(). Results are stored in the specified result buffer or transformation matrix object. To retrieve the matrix from a result buffer, use M3dimCopyResult() with M_TRANSFORMATION_MATRIX. The source and target can be both containers or both MIL array buffers (M_ARRAY), or any combination of the two. Note that only pairs with 2 valid points are considered. For a MIL array buffer, all points are valid; for a container, points are valid if their corresponding confidence score is non-zero. For this function to succeed, at least 3 non-collinear point pairs are required for a rigid transformation, and at least 4 non-coplanar point pairs are required for an affine transformation. If the operation fails, M3dimGetResult() with M_STATUS returns M_NOT_ENOUGH_POINT_PAIRS, M_ALL_POINTS_COPLANAR, or M_NOT_INITIALIZED, and the zero matrix is returned. Note that attempting to use the zero matrix in functions such as M3dimMatrixTransform() will cause an error. To verify that the matrix is a valid rigid or affine transformation and not the zero matrix, call M3dgeoInquire() with M_RIGID or M_AFFINE (respectively) and ensure that the function returns M_TRUE. Parameters Parameters FindTransformationContext3dimId Specifies the identifier of a find transformation 3D image processing context. For specifying the find transformation 3D image processing context identifier Value Description M_FIND_TRANSFORMATION_CONTEXT_AFFINE Specifies to find an affine transformation between the source and target sets of points. You should use this mode when one set of points (either source or target) originates from an uncalibrated source, which might contain a distortion such as a shear. Note that this mode requires at least 4 non-coplanar point pairs. M_FIND_TRANSFORMATION_CONTEXT_RIGID Specifies to find a rigid transformation between the source and target sets of points. You should use this mode when the two sets of points (source and target) differ by a physical displacement in three dimensions (for example, a rotation and/or translation). Note that this mode requires at least 3 non-collinear point pairs. SourceContainerOrArrayBufId Specifies the identifier of the source container containing a 3D-processable point cloud, or specifies the identifier of the source MIL array buffer. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE). The source MIL array buffer must be a 3-band floating-point buffer, allocated using MbufAllocColor() with M_ARRAY, and must have the same size as the target. You can load values into the buffer using, for example, MbufPutColor(). TargetContainerOrArrayBufId Specifies the identifier of the target container containing a 3D-processable point cloud, or specifies the identifier of the target MIL array buffer. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE). The target MIL array buffer must be a 3-band floating-point buffer, allocated using MbufAllocColor() with M_ARRAY, and must have the same size as the source. You can load values into the buffer using, for example, MbufPutColor(). Result3dimOrMatrix3dgeoId Specifies the identifier of the find transformation 3D image processing result buffer or transformation matrix object in which to store the calculated transformation matrix. The result buffer must have been allocated using M3dimAllocResult() with M_FIND_TRANSFORMATION_RESULT; the result buffer holds the transformation matrix and the status of the operation.

You can use M3dimFix() to verify that a container is suitable for use with another 3D function. You can optionally specify a destination container to obtain a modified copy of the source container that fixes the specified conditions. Parameters Parameters SrcContainerBufId Specifies the identifier of the source point cloud container, previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC. The container must be 3D processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE). DstContainerBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination container in which to place the modified point cloud. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must not be a child container. If you do not want to retrieve a modified point cloud that satisfies the given conditions, you must set this parameter to M_NULL. Conditions Specifies which conditions you would like to be validated and optionally fixed. The values in the tables below can be added together to specify multiple conditions. For example, to verify that a mesh contains only valid points and that there are no degenerate triangles, specify M_MESH_VALID_POINTS + M_MESH_VALID_NEIGHBORS. For specifying the conditions to validate Value Description M_ALL Specifies to verify that all the conditions listed in this table are met. Conditions are only validated if the specified source point cloud container has the component required to validate the condition. If you specify a DstContainerBufId, you will retrieve a modified version of the source point cloud container that satisfies all the valid conditions for it. M_MESH_VALID_NEIGHBORS Specifies to check each edge in the mesh to verify that the edge appears in at most two triangular faces. Triangular faces are also verified to ensure that they are constructed from three different vertices to ensure that there are no degenerate triangular faces in the mesh. This option is available when the source container has an M_COMPONENT_MESH_MIL component. M_MESH_VALID_NEIGHBORS must be satisfied for some functions which use a mesh component, such as M3dmetVolume(). If you specify a destination container and more than two triangular faces are found sharing a common edge, the first two faces are kept, while the subsequent triangles are removed. M_MESH_VALID_POINTS Specifies to check that each point in the mesh is valid; a valid point has a non-zero confidence score. This option is available when the source container has an M_COMPONENT_MESH_MIL component. M_MESH_VALID_POINTS must be satisfied for all functions that use a mesh component. If you specify a destination container, any invalid point in the mesh that corresponds to the vertex of a triangular face results in that face's removal. M_NORMALS_FINITE Specifies to check that each point in the range component has a finite normal vector. This option is available when the source container has an M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL component. M_NORMALS_FINITE must be satisfied for all functions that use a normals component. If you specify a DstContainerBufId and points with infinite normal vectors are found, the point's confidence is set to 0 and the normals length is set to the range's invalid value. You can set this value using M_3D_INVALID_DATA_VALUE with MbufControl(). M_NORMALS_NORMALIZED Specifies to check that each point with a non-zero confidence has a normal with a norm of exactly one or zero. This option is available when the source container has an M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL component. M_NORMALS_NORMALIZED must be satisfied for all functions that use a normals component. If you specify a DstContainerBufId and normals are found without a norm of one or zero, they will be normalized to have a norm of one. M_RANGE_FINITE Specifies to check that each point in the range component is finite. M_RANGE_FINITE is required for all 3D functions. If you specify a DstContainerBufId and invalid points are found, the point's confidence is set to 0 and the point is set to the range's invalid value. You can set this value using M_3D_INVALID_DATA_VALUE with MbufControl(). M_UNREPLICATED_POINTS Specifies to check that each point in the range component with a non-zero confidence is unreplicated. If you specify a DstContainerBufId and replicated points are found, the point's confidence is set to 0. Note that when two points are replicates, either of the points could be removed. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion. This parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. ResultPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the conditions that were detected. Alternatively, if you do not want to return the conditions, you can set this parameter to M_NULL. Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; mil3dim.lib.

Syntax MIL_INT M3dimGet( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContainerOrImageBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Component, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;ArraySize, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Options, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;*DstCoord1OrPackedArrayPtr, //out MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;*DstCoord2ArrayPtr, //out MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;*DstCoord3ArrayPtr //out ) Description This function returns a component's values that correspond to valid points in the source point cloud or depth map container, or it returns valid values in a depth map image, excluding invalid points and points outside a region of interest (if the depth map image buffer is associated with an ROI). When copying from a floating-point buffer to an integer array, the values are truncated. If the source buffer depth is greater than that of the destination array, the most significant bits are truncated when the data is copied into the destination. For a depth map image, you can limit this function's results to a region of the depth map image buffer using a region of interest (ROI) set using MbufSetRegion(). The ROI must be defined in raster format (M_RASTER or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error is generated if the ROI is only in vector format (M_VECTOR). To get all the coordinates stored in a component, regardless of the corresponding confidence score, use MbufGet(). Note that presented above is an example prototype of this function. You can call M3dimGet() with the same prototype as any of the type-specific functions below, without using the function's type-specific name; that is, use M3dimGet() and not, for example, M3dimGetFloat(). MIL automatically casts the data into the appropriate type. This is true except when using a C compiler. When using a C compiler, you must always call this function with its type-specific name (you cannot use the standard name of this function). Parameters Parameters ContainerOrImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source point cloud container, depth map container, or depth map image buffer. The point cloud or depth map container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC. The point cloud container must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE). The depth map container must store data in a 3D-processable depth map format (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE). The image buffer must be an 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit unsigned buffer, and must contain a fully corrected depth map (that is, if you call McalInquire() with M_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE). If you specify an image buffer that has an ROI associated with it, the ROI must be in raster format; otherwise, you will get an error. Component Specifies the component from which to get values. The specified component must be of the same size as that of M_COMPONENT_RANGE, and must be an 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit image buffer. If the required component is not the same size, use MbufGet() instead. When ContainerOrImageBufId is a depth map image buffer, you must set Component to M_DEFAULT. Use the following settings to specify a component using its identifier or index. An error is generated if there is no component in the container matching the specified identifier or index. For specifying a component by its identifier or index Value Description M_COMPONENT_BY_ID( MIL_INT ID ) Specifies the component, in the container, that has the specified buffer identifier. Parameters ID Specifies the MIL identifier of the component. M_COMPONENT_BY_INDEX( MIL_INT ComponentIndex ) Specifies the component, in the container, at the specified index. Parameters ComponentIndex Specifies the index of the component. Use the following settings to specify a component by its component type, which identifies what kind of information the component stores. For specifying a component by its component type Value Description M_COMPONENT_CONFIDENCE Specifies that the component stores confidence information for the M_COMPONENT_RANGE component of the container. Coordinates associated with the confidence value 0 are considered invalid data and will not be used by 3D image processing functions. M_COMPONENT_COORDINATE_MAP_A_MIL Specifies that the component stores the A coordinate map provided by the camera. When using MbufConvert3d() with a projective map, this component can be used instead of the column index of each corresponding pixel and will result in a better representation of the camera's lens model when generating X-coordinates. A coordinate map component is associated with a range component in the same container when there is only one range component and only one type of each coordinate map component in that container. Note that this component is only available if it is provided by the camera. For more information refer to your cameras manual. M_COMPONENT_COORDINATE_MAP_B_MIL Specifies that the component stores the B coordinate map provided by the camera. When using MbufConvert3d() with a projective map, this component can be used instead of the row index of each corresponding pixel and will result in a better representation of the camera's lens model when generating Y-coordinates. A coordinate map component is associated with a range component in the same container when there is only one range component and only one type of each coordinate map component in that container. Note that this component is only available if it is provided by the camera. For more information refer to your cameras manual. M_COMPONENT_CUSTOM + n Specifies that the component has a custom component type, identified by n, where n can be a value between 0 and 254. You can use custom component types to identify components which store information that does not fit one of the standard component types. In addition, some cameras transmit components with custom component types. Refer to your camera manual to determine what type of information is stored in transmitted components. M_COMPONENT_DISPARITY Specifies that the component stores a disparity map. Each pixel of a disparity map indicates the apparent distance (typically measured in pixel units) between where an object appears in the left and right images captured by a stereoscopic camera. M_COMPONENT_INFRARED Specifies that the component stores an intensity image of infrared light. M_COMPONENT_INTENSITY Specifies that the component stores an intensity image of visible light. M_COMPONENT_METADATA Specifies that the component stores metadata information. Metadata components are used by MIL internally. Typically, you should ignore metadata components in your application. M_COMPONENT_MULTISPECTRAL Specifies that the component stores an intensity image where each band represents the intensity of a specific wavelength of light. Unlike an intensity component, a multispectral component might include information about non-visible light. M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL Specifies that the component stores normals information for each point in the M_COMPONENT_RANGE component of the container. M_COMPONENT_RANGE Specifies that the component stores 3D position information. This is a 3-band buffer that stores coordinates of 3D points. M_COMPONENT_REFLECTANCE Specifies that the component stores a reflectance map. Each pixel of a reflectance map indicates how much of the light hitting an object at that location is reflected back. Typically, this is an intensity image of the light spectrum used by a 3D sensor to detect 3D distance/position information. Typically, if the map was generated by a laser profiler, each row indicates the detected intensity of the laser for a single scan. M_COMPONENT_SCATTER Specifies that the component stores a scatter map. Each pixel of a scatter map indicates how much of the light hitting an object at that location is detected scattering beneath the object's surface. M_COMPONENT_ULTRAVIOLET Specifies that the component stores an intensity image of ultraviolet light. M_COMPONENT_UNDEFINED Specifies that the component stores information of an unknown type. ArraySize Specifies the maximum number of elements that the arrays can hold. If the specified ArraySize is larger than the number of points written, the rest of the array is left unchanged; if ArraySize is less than the number of points available, the points are written up to the specified ArraySize. When determining the required size of the arrays for subsequent calls to M3dimGet(), set this parameter to M_NULL. When using a standard vector (std::vector) overload function in C++, you can pass M_DEFAULT to this parameter and MIL will automatically determine the size based on the number of items in the vector passed to the DstCoord1OrPackedArrayPtr, DstCoord2ArrayPtr, or DstCoord3ArrayPtr parameter. Options Specifies additional options. For specifying the storage format Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_PLANAR. M_PACKED Specifies to store the component data in a packed format. M_PLANAR Specifies to store the component data in a planar format. DstCoord1OrPackedArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) array of type MIL_FLOAT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_FLOAT&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) array of type MIL_INT16 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT16&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) array of type MIL_INT32 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT32&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) array of type MIL_INT8 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT8&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) array of type MIL_UINT16 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_UINT16&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) array of type MIL_UINT32 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_UINT32&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) array of type MIL_UINT8 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_UINT8&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) Specifies the address of the user array in which to store the retrieved data. This array can hold the values of the specified point cloud or depth map's component, or a packed array of all the data. For instance, a depth map's 3 bands of coordinate data, if packed, is stored in the array in an interleaved manner (for example, XYZ XYZ XYZ...). When determining the required size of this array for subsequent calls to M3dimGet(), set this parameter to M_NULL. DstCoord2ArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) array of type MIL_FLOAT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_FLOAT&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) array of type MIL_INT16 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT16&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) array of type MIL_INT32 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT32&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) array of type MIL_INT8 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT8&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) array of type MIL_UINT16 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_UINT16&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) array of type MIL_UINT32 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_UINT32&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) array of type MIL_UINT8 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_UINT8&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) Specifies the address of the user array in which to store the retrieved data. If the component is 3-band and Options is set to M_PLANAR, the pointer passed to DstCoord2ArrayPtr must be valid. If the component is 1-band or Options is set to M_PACKED, set DstCoord2ArrayPtr to M_NULL. When determining the required size of this array for subsequent calls to M3dimGet(), set this parameter to M_NULL. DstCoord3ArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) array of type MIL_FLOAT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_FLOAT&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) array of type MIL_INT16 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT16&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) array of type MIL_INT32 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT32&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) array of type MIL_INT8 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT8&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) array of type MIL_UINT16 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_UINT16&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) array of type MIL_UINT32 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_UINT32&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) array of type MIL_UINT8 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_UINT8&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(ArraySize) Specifies the address of the user array in which to store the retrieved data.

When determining the required size of this array for subsequent calls to M3dimGet(), set this parameter to M_NULL. Return value The returned value is the number of entries written into the array(s). If DstCoord1OrPackedArrayPtr, DstCoord2ArrayPtr and DstCoord3ArrayPtr are set to M_NULL, M3dimGet() returns the required size of the array(s) for subsequent calls to the function.

Syntax MIL_INT M3dimGetList( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContainerOrImageBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Component, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;SrcArraySize, //in const MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;*SrcPixelXArrayPtr, //in const MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;*SrcPixelYArrayPtr, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Options, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;*DstCoord1OrPackedArrayPtr, //out MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;*DstCoord2ArrayPtr, //out MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;*DstCoord3ArrayPtr, //out MIL_INT32&nbsp;*IndexArrayPtr //out ) Description This function reads the values in a source container or depth map image buffer, at the specified positions, and places the values in the specified destination arrays. If the source is a container, you must specify from which component to copy the data. Each X/Y pair listed in the source arrays specifies the position of a point in its container's 2D grid organization (or pixel location in a depth map). Unlike MbufGetList(), this function has options for casting, storing the data in packed or planar format, and handling invalid points. It also returns the number of points written to the arrays. Note that the source array(s) can specify positions with subpixel precision. In this case, the source buffer is typically an organized point cloud. To establish values for the destination array(s), you can specify to interpolate between neighboring values that surround each subpixel position in the container's specified component. To determine the size of the arrays required to store the requested values, call this function and set DstCoord1OrPackedArrayPtr, DstCoord2ArrayPtr and DstCoord3ArrayPtr to M_NULL. The function will return the required array size(s). Note that presented above is an example prototype of this function. You can call M3dimGetList() with the same prototype as any of the type-specific functions below, without using the function's type-specific name; that is, use M3dimGetList() and not, for example, M3dimGetListDoubleInt16(). MIL automatically casts the data into the appropriate type. This is true except when using a C compiler. When using a C compiler, you must always call this function with its type-specific name (you cannot use the standard name of this function). Parameters Parameters ContainerOrImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source point cloud container, depth map container, or depth map image buffer. The point cloud or depth map container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC. The point cloud container must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE). The depth map container must store data in a 3D-processable depth map format (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE). The image buffer must be an 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit unsigned buffer, and must contain a fully corrected depth map (that is, if you call McalInquire() with M_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE). If you specify an image buffer that has an ROI associated with it, the ROI must be in raster format; otherwise, you will get an error. Component Specifies the component from which to get point information. The specified component must be the same size as that of M_COMPONENT_RANGE, and must be an 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit image buffer. If the required component is not the same size, use MbufGetList() instead. When ContainerOrImageBufId is a depth map image buffer, you must set Component to M_DEFAULT. Use the following settings to specify a component using its identifier or index. An error is generated if there is no component in the container matching the specified identifier or index. For specifying a component by its identifier or index Value Description M_COMPONENT_BY_ID( MIL_INT ID ) Specifies the component, in the container, that has the specified buffer identifier. Parameters ID Specifies the MIL identifier of the component. M_COMPONENT_BY_INDEX( MIL_INT ComponentIndex ) Specifies the component, in the container, at the specified index. Parameters ComponentIndex Specifies the index of the component. Use the following settings to specify a component by its component type, which identifies what kind of information the component stores. For specifying a component by its component type Value Description M_COMPONENT_CONFIDENCE Specifies that the component stores confidence information for the M_COMPONENT_RANGE component of the container. Coordinates associated with the confidence value 0 are considered invalid data and will not be used by 3D image processing functions. M_COMPONENT_COORDINATE_MAP_A_MIL Specifies that the component stores the A coordinate map provided by the camera. When using MbufConvert3d() with a projective map, this component can be used instead of the column index of each corresponding pixel and will result in a better representation of the camera's lens model when generating X-coordinates. A coordinate map component is associated with a range component in the same container when there is only one range component and only one type of each coordinate map component in that container. Note that this component is only available if it is provided by the camera. For more information refer to your cameras manual. M_COMPONENT_COORDINATE_MAP_B_MIL Specifies that the component stores the B coordinate map provided by the camera. When using MbufConvert3d() with a projective map, this component can be used instead of the row index of each corresponding pixel and will result in a better representation of the camera's lens model when generating Y-coordinates. A coordinate map component is associated with a range component in the same container when there is only one range component and only one type of each coordinate map component in that container. Note that this component is only available if it is provided by the camera. For more information refer to your cameras manual. M_COMPONENT_CUSTOM + n Specifies that the component has a custom component type, identified by n, where n can be a value between 0 and 254. You can use custom component types to identify components which store information that does not fit one of the standard component types. In addition, some cameras transmit components with custom component types. Refer to your camera manual to determine what type of information is stored in transmitted components. M_COMPONENT_DISPARITY Specifies that the component stores a disparity map. Each pixel of a disparity map indicates the apparent distance (typically measured in pixel units) between where an object appears in the left and right images captured by a stereoscopic camera. M_COMPONENT_INFRARED Specifies that the component stores an intensity image of infrared light. M_COMPONENT_INTENSITY Specifies that the component stores an intensity image of visible light. M_COMPONENT_METADATA Specifies that the component stores metadata information. Metadata components are used by MIL internally. Typically, you should ignore metadata components in your application. M_COMPONENT_MULTISPECTRAL Specifies that the component stores an intensity image where each band represents the intensity of a specific wavelength of light. Unlike an intensity component, a multispectral component might include information about non-visible light. M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL Specifies that the component stores normals information for each point in the M_COMPONENT_RANGE component of the container. M_COMPONENT_RANGE Specifies that the component stores 3D distance/position information. This is a 3-band buffer that stores coordinates of 3D points. M_COMPONENT_REFLECTANCE Specifies that the component stores a reflectance map. Each pixel of a reflectance map indicates how much of the light hitting an object at that location is reflected back. Typically, this is an intensity image of the light spectrum used by a 3D sensor to detect 3D distance/position information. Typically, if the map was generated by a laser profiler, each row indicates the detected intensity of the laser for a single scan. M_COMPONENT_SCATTER Specifies that the component stores a scatter map. Each pixel of a scatter map indicates how much of the light hitting an object at that location is detected scattering beneath the object's surface. M_COMPONENT_ULTRAVIOLET Specifies that the component stores an intensity image of ultraviolet light. M_COMPONENT_UNDEFINED Specifies that the component stores information of an unknown type. SrcArraySize Specifies the number of values in the source array(s). When using a standard vector (std::vector) overload function in C++, you can pass M_DEFAULT to this parameter and MIL will automatically determine the size based on the number of items in the vector passed to the SrcPixelXArrayPtr or SrcPixelYArrayPtr parameter. SrcPixelXArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(SrcArraySize) array of type MIL_FLOAT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_FLOAT&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:Call M3dimGetList() with DstCoord1OrPackedArrayPtr set to M_NULL, DstCoord2ArrayPtr set to M_NULL, DstCoord3ArrayPtr set to M_NULL, and IndexArrayPtr set to M_NULL.

The array size is stored in the return value of the function. array of type MIL_UINT32 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_UINT32&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:Call M3dimGetList() with DstCoord1OrPackedArrayPtr set to M_NULL, DstCoord2ArrayPtr set to M_NULL, DstCoord3ArrayPtr set to M_NULL, and IndexArrayPtr set to M_NULL. The array size is stored in the return value of the function. array of type MIL_UINT8 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_UINT8&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:Call M3dimGetList() with DstCoord1OrPackedArrayPtr set to M_NULL, DstCoord2ArrayPtr set to M_NULL, DstCoord3ArrayPtr set to M_NULL, and IndexArrayPtr set to M_NULL. The array size is stored in the return value of the function. Specifies the address of an array containing the Y-positions of values to get. Each position is that of a point in its container's 2D grid organization (or pixel location in a depth map). Positions can be specified with subpixel precision. If the source container is unorganized, you can set this parameter to M_NULL. Options Specifies additional options. Note that you can combine settings (for example, M_PACKED + M_BILINEAR + M_INCLUDE_INVALID_POINTS). Any option not specified uses the default value. For instance, setting this parameter to M_PACKED also sets M_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR and M_SKIP_INVALID_POINTS, even though M_PACKED is the only explicitly-set value. For specifying default options Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_PLANAR + M_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR + M_SKIP_INVALID_POINTS. Combination values that can be used alone or as combination values for any of the possible values of the Options parameter. You can use one of the following values on its own, or add it to the above-mentioned value, to specify the storage format in the destination array(s). For specifying the storage format Value Description M_PACKED Specifies to store the data in a packed format. M_PLANAR Specifies to store the data in a planar format. This is the default value. Combination values that can be used alone or as combination values for any of the possible values of the Options parameter.

For specifying how to interpret subpixel positions in the source array(s) Value Description M_BILINEAR Specifies bilinear interpolation. The value placed in the user-defined array is determined by taking a weighted average of the 4 values (2x2) that surround the subpixel position. If any of the 4 surrounding values is invalid, M_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR is used instead. M_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR Specifies nearest neighbor interpolation. The value placed in the user-defined array is that of the value of the pixel closest to the subpixel position. This is the default value. Combination values that can be used alone or as combination values for any of the possible values of the Options parameter. You can use one of the following values on its own, or add it to the above-mentioned value, to specify how to deal with invalid points. For specifying how to deal with invalid points Value Description M_INCLUDE_INVALID_POINTS Specifies to include invalid points. If a point is invalid, the function writes an unspecified value in the data output array(s) and -1 in the source-index array (IndexArrayPtr). For example, if the input confidence = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], and the input component = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5], then the data output array = [3, ?, 4, ?, 5], with indices = [0, -1, 2, -1, 4]. M_SKIP_INVALID_POINTS Specifies to skip invalid points so that the output arrays contain only valid points. For example, if the input confidence = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], and the input component = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5], then the data output array = [3, 4, 5], with indices = [0, 2, 4]. This is the default value. DstCoord1OrPackedArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(SrcArraySize) array of type MIL_FLOAT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_FLOAT&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:Call M3dimGetList() with DstCoord1OrPackedArrayPtr set to M_NULL, DstCoord2ArrayPtr set to M_NULL, DstCoord3ArrayPtr set to M_NULL, and IndexArrayPtr set to M_NULL.

The array size is stored in the return value of the function. Specifies the address of a user-defined array in which to store the retrieved data. This array can hold the values of the specified point cloud or depth map's component, or a packed array of all the data. For instance, the range component's 3 bands of coordinate data, if packed, is stored in the array in an interleaved manner (for example, XYZ XYZ XYZ...). Note that you can specify an array of the required type; MIL automatically casts the data into the appropriate type. When determining the required size of this array for subsequent calls to M3dimGetList(), set this parameter to M_NULL.

Syntax void M3dimLattice( MIL_ID&nbsp;LatticeContext3dimId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;ContainerBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;Box3dgeoId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;LatticeResultOrContext3dimId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function calculates a lattice that divides points into cells. You can use the calculated lattice to subsample or project the point cloud, where one point is selected per cell, or all points in a cell are projected into the same depth map pixel, respectively. Use M3dimControl() to set constraints on the lattice before calling this function. For example, you can specify the relative cell dimensions, using M_RELATIVE_CELL_SIZE_.... Results are stored in the specified lattice 3D image processing result buffer or subsample 3D image processing context. You can retrieve results from the lattice 3D image processing result buffer, using M3dimGetResult(). To use the lattice to subsample the point cloud, specify a subsample 3D image processing context. Alternatively, you can store results in a lattice 3D image processing result buffer, and then copy them into a subsample 3D image processing context, using M3dimCopyResult() with M_SUBSAMPLE_CONTEXT. When you call M3dimSample() with a subsample 3D image processing context containing lattice results, a grid operation is performed where one point is selected per cell in the lattice. Empty cells or cells containing only invalid points are ignored. This function can be used instead of M3dimCalculateMapSize() to calculate a recommended depth map image buffer size to use to project the point cloud. In this case, you must store results in a lattice 3D image processing result buffer. You can retrieve the sizes along X and Y using M3dimGetResult() with M_NUMBER_OF_CELLS_X and M_NUMBER_OF_CELLS_Y, and then pass these values to MbufAlloc2d() to allocate an image buffer that will hold the depth map. You can retrieve the start point and cell/pixel sizes in X and Y using M3dimGetResult() with M_START_POINT_X, M_START_POINT_Y, M_CELL_SIZE_X, and M_CELL_SIZE_Y, and then pass these values to McalUniform() to calibrate the allocated image buffer for the depth map. When you call M3dimProject() with the calibrated depth map image buffer, all the points in a cell are projected into the same depth map pixel. Empty cells or cells containing only invalid points will result in invalid pixels. Parameters Parameters LatticeContext3dimId Specifies the identifier of the lattice 3D image processing context. The context must have been previously allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_LATTICE_CONTEXT. ContainerBufId Specifies the identifier of the source container containing a 3D-processable point cloud. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE). Box3dgeoId Specifies the identifier of the axis-aligned 3D box geometry object to use to determine the lattice origin and number of cells. Only points inside the box are used to calculate the lattice. The 3D box geometry object must have been previously allocated using M3dgeoAlloc() with M_GEOMETRY, and defined as a box. If a 3D box geometry object is not required, set this parameter to M_NULL. The source container's axis-aligned bounding box is used instead. LatticeResultOrContext3dimId Specifies the identifier of the lattice 3D image processing result buffer or subsample 3D image processing context. For specifying the lattice 3D image processing result buffer or subsample 3D image processing context identifier Value Description MIL lattice 3D image processing result buffer identifier Specifies the identifier of a lattice 3D image processing result buffer, previously allocated using M3dimAllocResult() with M_LATTICE_RESULT. MIL subsample 3D image processing context identifier Specifies the identifier of a subsample 3D image processing context, previously allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_SUBSAMPLE_CONTEXT. Note that this is equivalent to specifying a lattice 3D image processing result buffer and using M3dimCopyResult() with M_SUBSAMPLE_CONTEXT.

Note that you can combine M_ROTATION_AND_SCALE with M_PACKED or M_PLANAR (that is, you can set the ControlFlag parameter to M_ROTATION_AND_SCALE + M_PACKED or M_ROTATION_AND_SCALE + M_PLANAR). For specifying the control flag Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_PLANAR. M_PACKED Specifies that the source points are passed in a packed format and/or that the destination points should be returned in a packed format, depending on what you pass to the SrcCoordYArrayPtr, SrcCoordZArrayPtr, DstCoordYArrayPtr, and DstCoordZArrayPtr parameters. If both SrcCoordYArrayPtr and SrcCoordZArrayPtr are passed M_NULL, SrcCoordXArrayPtr is assumed to be a packed set of X-, Y-, and Z-coordinates. If both DstCoordYArrayPtr and DstCoordZArrayPtr are passed M_NULL, DstCoordXArrayPtr is filled with a packed set of X-, Y-, and Z-coordinates. If SrcCoordYArrayPtr, SrcCoordZArrayPtr, DstCoordYArrayPtr, and DstCoordZArrayPtr are passed M_NULL, SrcCoordXArrayPtr is assumed to be a packed set of X-, Y-, and Z-coordinates, and DstCoordXArrayPtr is filled with a packed set of X-, Y-, and Z-coordinates. M_PLANAR Specifies that the source and destination coordinates are stored in a planar format; that is, the X-, Y-, and Z-coordinate values are stored in 3 separate arrays. When M_PLANAR is specified, no source or destination array pointer parameters can be set to M_NULL. M_ROTATION_AND_SCALE Specifies to apply only the rotation and scale parts of the transformation to the source points. Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; mil3dim.lib.

Syntax void M3dimMerge( const MIL_ID&nbsp;*SrcContainerBufIdArrayPtr, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstContainerBufId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;NumContainers, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;Context3dimId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function merges all the specified point clouds or depth maps into a single point cloud or depth map. Merged point clouds will either be unorganized or organized in a 3D-processable point cloud container, whereas merged depth maps will always be organized in a 3D-processable depth map container. By default, each depth map will be stitched in fast mode (M_FAST) to the first depth map provided in the array. You can specify to stitch to a different depth map, using M3dimControl() with M_STATIC_INDEX. When M_STITCH_MODE is set to M_FAST, the depth maps are combined quickly but without interpolation, risking an inaccurate stitch. If the depth map pixels are not perfectly aligned with the chosen depth map (for example, the world X-coordinate is 1 for the first pixel in the depth map that you specify with M_STATIC_INDEX, but the world X-coordinate is 3.2 for the first pixel in a depth map to be stitched, and they both have a pixel width of 0.5 world units), the stitch will not be accurate in fast mode because its pixels will be forced to shift to align with the pixels of the chosen depth map in the destination, with no gray level correction for the shift to represent the new position. For example, the intensity value of the destination pixel at (3,0) in the world will be the intensity value of the source pixel at (3.2,0) in the world. You can set M_STITCH_MODE to M_PRECISE so that the destination depth map pixels are assigned interpolated gray levels. In the above example, MIL will attempt to calculate an intensity value for the destination pixel at (3,0) in the world by taking a weighted average of the four source pixels nearest that point. Note that stitching depth maps in precise mode is slower, but more accurate. If 2 depth maps overlap in X and/or Y, the pixel value in the resulting depth map will be the average value of the overlapping pixels, by default. You can specify to use the minimum or maximum value instead, using M3dimControl() with M_OVERLAP_MODE. Optionally, to reduce the number of points in the resulting point cloud, you can specify a subsample 3D image processing context, to apply a subsampling operation to the merged point cloud. Note that if you specify a stitch or subsample 3D image processing context, the stitch or subsample control settings specified using M3dimControl() are applied. Note that after the merge operation, a resulting point cloud is unorganized, unless a stitch context is specified or the optional subsample context specifies an organized resulting point cloud (that is, M3dimControl() with M_ORGANIZATION_TYPE is set to M_ORGANIZED). If you did not specify a stitch context, or a subsample context and the aforementioned control setting, and the resulting merged point cloud is unorganized, you can still create an organized point cloud from the data. To do so, pass the unorganized point cloud to M3dimSample() along with a subsample 3D image processing context configured using M3dimControl() with M_SUBSAMPLE_MODE set to M_SUBSAMPLE_GRID and M_ORGANIZATION_TYPE set to M_ORGANIZED. Note that in this case, you cannot set M_SUBSAMPLE_MODE to M_SUBSAMPLE_DECIMATE, since this mode is supported only when the source point cloud is organized. Parameters Parameters SrcContainerBufIdArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_ID [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_ID&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumContainers) Specifies the address of the array that holds the identifiers of the point cloud containers, depth map containers, or depth map image buffers to merge. You can set some entries in the array to M_NULL to exclude them from the merge operation. For specifying the array of containers or image buffers Value Description Depth map container array identifier Specifies an array containing the identifiers of depth map containers. The depth map containers must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must store data in a 3D-processable depth map format (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE). Depth map image buffer array identifier Specifies an array containing the identifiers of depth map image buffers. The image buffers must be 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit unsigned, 1-band buffers, and must contain a fully corrected depth map (that is, if you call McalInquire() with M_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE). Point cloud container array identifier Specifies an array containing the identifiers of point cloud containers. The point cloud containers must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE). DstContainerBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination container in which to store the resulting point cloud or depth map. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must not be a child container. When merging point clouds, the resulting point cloud will be unorganized, unless the optional subsample context specifies an organized resulting point cloud or the optional stitch context is specified. NumContainers Specifies the size of the array passed to SrcContainerBufIdArrayPtr. When using a standard vector (std::vector) overload function in C++, you can pass M_DEFAULT to this parameter and MIL will automatically determine the size based on the number of items in the vector passed to the SrcContainerBufIdArrayPtr parameter. Context3dimId Specifies the stitch or subsample 3D image processing context identifier. For specifying the stitch or subsample 3D image processing context identifier Value Description M_NULL Specifies to ignore this parameter. Note that the resulting merged point cloud will be unorganized. This value is only available when merging point clouds. M_STITCH_CONTEXT_DEFAULT Specifies a predefined stitch 3D image processing context with the default settings. Note that the resulting merged point cloud or depth map will be organized. This value is only available when merging organized point clouds or depth maps. MIL stitch 3D image processing context identifier Specifies the identifier of a stitch 3D image processing context, previously allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_STITCH_CONTEXT. Note that M3dimControl() with M_STATIC_INDEX must be set to a value less than the NumContainers parameter. Note that the resulting merged point cloud or depth map will be organized. This value is only available when merging organized point clouds or depth maps. MIL subsample 3D image processing context identifier Specifies the identifier of a subsample 3D image processing context, previously allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_SUBSAMPLE_CONTEXT. Note that the organization of the resulting merged point clouds depends on the value of M3dimControl() with M_ORGANIZATION_TYPE. This value is only available when merging point clouds. ControlFlag Specifies which components will be affected by the operation. Note that when merging depth map image buffers, this parameter is reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. For specifying whether to merge points from all components Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the operation will only affect the core components of a 3D-processable point cloud or depth map container. These core components are listed in the description of MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE or M_3D_PROCESSABLE_DEPTH_MAP. All other components are copied to the destination container unmodified. M_APPLY_TO_ALL_COMPONENTS Specifies that the operation will affect the core components of a 3D-processable point cloud container, as well as any other component (including custom components) that has the same dimension as M_COMPONENT_RANGE. These components must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with them. For example, using a component that is an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Note that if a custom component has an associated calibration context, the component's information is merged, but its calibration context is discarded. To avoid ambiguity, within each source point cloud container, each component must be unique such that its data type and number of bands are not identical to any other component of the same type in the container. M_APPLY_TO_ALL_COMPONENTS does not support 1-bit buffers. If the resulting operation yields an empty container with 0 valid points, the components with the same dimensions are not created and will not exist in the destination container. This value is only available when merging point clouds. Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; mil3dim.lib. DLL Requires mil.dll; mil3dim.dll.

Syntax void M3dimMesh( MIL_ID&nbsp;MeshContext3dimId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcContainerBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstContainerBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function generates a triangular mesh structure for the source container's point cloud, using the specified surface reconstruction mode. The mesh data is stored in an M_COMPONENT_MESH_MIL component, which is added to the destination container. You can choose the surface reconstruction mode with which to create the mesh, either organized, local plane, or smoothed. Use M3dimControl() with M_MESH_MODE to set the mode, or use this function to specify a predefined context that uses default settings to create the mesh. The organized surface reconstruction mode (M_MESH_ORGANIZED) requires an organized point cloud and connects neighboring points to create the mesh. With this mode, invalid data points in the point cloud result in a mesh with holes. No change is made to the source container's M_COMPONENT_RANGE and M_COMPONENT_CONFIDENCE components; they are simply copied over to the destination container. If the components M_COMPONENT_INTENSITY, M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL, and M_COMPONENT_REFLECTANCE exist in the source container, these are also copied to the destination container. The local plane reconstruction mode (M_MESH_LOCAL_PLANE) also connects neighboring points to create the mesh; however, it uses local planes computed from each point's neighborhood to establish which neighbors to connect. For each point, neighborhood points are projected to the local plane and the most suitable points are chosen to form a mesh triangle with the point in question. Note that the triangle's vertices are points from the original point cloud, which can be organized or unorganized. With this mode, the mesh can have holes. Components are handled in the same way as for the organized surface reconstruction mode. Note that normal vectors at each 3D point are required (M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL component). The smoothed surface reconstruction mode (M_MESH_SMOOTHED) also requires normal vectors at each 3D point (M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL component) and generates a mesh by solving a Poisson equation. This approach generates a smooth surface even when the source point cloud is noisy; missing data is approximated when possible, resulting in significantly fewer holes. Before solving the Poisson equation, an octree is built, which partitions the 3D space for the mesh calculation. The octree's depth determines the mesh's resolution. Note that a higher octree depth gives a higher resolution, but a slower calculation time. Smoothed surface reconstruction generates a new point cloud; new M_COMPONENT_RANGE and M_COMPONENT_CONFIDENCE components are added to the destination container, along with the mesh component. To remove points from the point cloud whose confidence is equal to zero, as well as points that are not part of the mesh, use M3dimRemovePoints() with M_NOT_MESH_POINTS. Note that, when using the smoothed surface reconstruction mode, no M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL component is added to the destination container. To determine the number of triangular faces in the mesh, inquire the M_COMPONENT_MESH_MIL component using MbufInquireContainer() with M_SIZE_X. Inquiring the M_SIZE_Y value of the M_COMPONENT_MESH_MIL component returns 3 for an unorganized destination point cloud (3 vertices for each triangular face), and 6 for an organized destination point cloud (3 vertices with corresponding coordinates in both X and Y). Parameters Parameters MeshContext3dimId Specifies a mesh 3D image processing context. For specifying the mesh 3D image processing context identifier Value Description M_MESH_CONTEXT_LOCAL_PLANE Specifies a predefined mesh 3D image processing context with all mesh context control types (M3dimControl()) set to their default, except for M_MESH_MODE which is set to M_MESH_LOCAL_PLANE. Use this predefined context to create the mesh from local planes that are fit to neighboring points. With the local plane surface reconstruction mode, local planes help determine which points in the source point cloud to connect. With this mode, the mesh can have holes. M_MESH_CONTEXT_ORGANIZED Specifies a predefined mesh 3D image processing context with all mesh context control types (M3dimControl()) set to their default, except for M_MESH_MODE which is set to M_MESH_ORGANIZED. Use this predefined context to create the mesh using the organized surface reconstruction mode. With surface reconstruction from an organized point cloud, neighboring points are connected. Any invalid points will result in a mesh with holes. M_MESH_CONTEXT_SMOOTHED Specifies a predefined mesh 3D image processing context with all mesh context control types (M3dimControl()) set to their default, except for M_MESH_MODE which is set to M_MESH_SMOOTHED. Use this predefined context to generate a mesh with a smoothed surface. With the smoothed surface reconstruction mode, the mesh structure is extrapolated from existing points and smoothing is applied to reduce the noise in the point cloud; missing data is approximated when possible, resulting in significantly fewer holes. This mode generates a new point cloud with a smooth surface. MIL mesh 3D image processing context identifier Specifies the identifier of a mesh 3D image processing context, previously allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_MESH_CONTEXT. If a previously allocated context is specified, the function applies the mesh control settings specified using M3dimControl(). SrcContainerBufId Specifies the identifier of the 3D-processable point cloud container to use as the source. The container must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE). The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC. DstContainerBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination container, previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC. The destination container must not be a child container. The destination container's M_COMPONENT_MESH_MIL component stores the mesh data in an unsigned, 32-bit, 1-band, 2D array buffer.

Any previously existing M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL component in the destination container is overwritten. All other source components are copied to the destination container, and replace any previously existing components. For some functions that use normal values, how those values were calculated can affect results. For example, when using M3dimFilter() with a bilateral smoothing filter (M_SMOOTH_BILATERAL), the filter operation works best with normals that were calculated using the M_MESH or M_TREE neighbor search mode (M3dimControl() with M_NEIGHBOR_SEARCH_MODE). However, normals created using the M_ORGANIZED mode can give faster filtering results. Parameters Parameters NormalsContext3dimId Specifies a normals 3D image processing context.

An outlier is a point identified as anomalous (for instance, due to noise), typically because it is too distant from neighboring points. Use M3dimControl() to set the outlier mode (M_OUTLIER_MODE) and other options for the operation. M3dimOutliers() sets the confidence of outlier points to zero; the points will still exist but are invalidated. You can specify one or two destination objects. If specifying two, the first receives a copy of the source with outlier points invalidated; the second receives a mask image in which pixels that correspond to outlier points are set to a non-zero value, while the rest of the pixels are set to zero. If specifying only one destination object, set the other to M_NULL. Depending on the destination parameter that you set, the function will produce either a point cloud (or depth map) with outlier points invalidated, or an outlier mask image. If you only create a mask image, you can examine the identified outliers before committing to invalidating them in the point cloud or depth map. For example, you can display outliers in a contrasting color and compare different masks created from the same point cloud or depth map. If the outcome is not satisfactory (for example, not enough outliers are identified or some are misidentified), you can adjust the outliers control settings and repeat the operation until the result is acceptable. Once you are satisfied, you can call M3dimOutliers() and specify a destination container that you are confident will have the true outlier points invalidated. Parameters Parameters OutliersContext3dimId Specifies an outliers 3D image processing context.

Use this predefined context to determine outliers based on the number of neighboring points with the automatically calculated neighborhood distance. M_OUTLIERS_CONTEXT_PROBABILITY Specifies a predefined outliers 3D image processing context with all outliers context control types (M3dimControl()) set to their default, except M_OUTLIER_MODE which is set to M_LOCAL_DENSITY_PROBABILITY. Use this predefined context to determine outliers based on the density of neighboring points and a probability calculation.

Use this predefined context to determine outliers based on the median and mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the local average distance distribution, which considers the average distance of all points to their closest neighbors. This context uses the default outlier mode (M_LOCAL_DISTANCE). M_OUTLIERS_CONTEXT_STD_DEVIATION Specifies a predefined outliers 3D image processing context with all outliers context control types (M3dimControl()) set to their default, except M_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD_MODE which is set to M_STD_DEVIATION. Use this predefined context to determine outliers based on the mean and standard deviation of the local average distance distribution, which considers the average distance of all points to their closest neighbors.

If a previously allocated context is specified, the function applies the outliers control settings specified using M3dimControl(). SrcContainerOrImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source point cloud container, depth map container, or depth map image buffer. The point cloud container must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE), and must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC. The depth map container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must store data in a 3D-processable depth map format (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE). The image buffer must be a 1-band, 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit unsigned buffer, and must contain a fully corrected depth map (that is, if you call McalInquire() with M_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE). Dst1ContainerOrImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination container or depth map image buffer. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must not be a child container. The destination will have the same components as the source container, with the confidence component updated accordingly. The image buffer must have the same dimensions as the buffer specified for SrcContainerOrImageBufId. In addition, the image buffer must be an unsigned, 1-band buffer with the same depth as the source buffer. If not required, set this parameter to M_NULL. Note that this parameter and Dst2ImageBufId cannot both be set to null. When not set to null, this parameter setting must match the source so that both are containers or both are depth map image buffers. Dst2ImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer in which pixels that correspond to outlier points will be set to a non-zero value, creating an outlier mask image. The rest of the pixels are set to zero, indicating inliers or preexisting invalid points in the source object. The image buffer must have the same dimensions as the buffer specified for SrcContainerOrImageBufId. In addition, the image buffer must be an 8-bit, unsigned, 1-band buffer.

The specified result buffer is filled with coordinates that make up the profile. For a depth map profile, pixels are sampled along a specified line and corresponding points are extracted; if the specified line crosses a valid depth map pixel, the corresponding point is included in the profile. The specified line effectively defines a slicing plane for the depth map, since the pixels' intensity values indicate depth (Z-values). You can use M3dimProfileEx() to consider multiple source points for each profile point so that the thickness of the line is taken into consideration. Note that M3dimProfileEx() always extracts a uniform depth map profile, where each point is at an equal distance away from the next along the profile line defined by the start and end points. For a 3D geometry or mesh profile, 3D points are sampled and extracted along an intersection of the specified slicing plane and the geometry or mesh. For a point cloud profile, 3D points are sampled and extracted along a specified slicing plane, which is divided into a grid of cells. For each cell, if points exist within the specified cutoff distance (perpendicular to the plane), the point closest to the plane is selected for the profile. Note that the profile contains valid points only. No profile points are extracted from gaps in the depth map or invalid points in the source container. You can retrieve results using M3dimGetResult(). To draw the profile, use M3dimDraw3d(). Alternatively, you can use MgraDots() or M3dgraDots() to draw the profile points. Parameters Parameters SrcMilObjectId Specifies the identifier of the source point cloud container, depth map container, 3D geometry object, or depth map image buffer. The point cloud or depth map container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC. The point cloud container must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE).

The specified destination container or result buffer is filled with coordinates that make up the profile. You can use M3dimControl() to specify settings, such as the thickness of the profile and the interpolation mode to use. Pixels are sampled along a specified line and corresponding points are considered for the profile. The specified line effectively defines a slicing plane for the depth map, since the pixels' intensity values indicate depth (Z-values). In M3dimProfile(), if the specified line crosses a valid depth map pixel, the corresponding point is included in the profile. Whereas, M3dimProfileEx() can sample multiple source pixels for each profile point so that the thickness of the line is taken into consideration; you can use M3dimControl() with M_PROFILE_THICKNESS to specify a thickness perpendicular to the profile line, and all points corresponding to pixels within the specified thickness of the line will be considered when determining the value of the destination pixel. This function always uniformly extracts points along the profile line defined by the start and end points; pixels are sampled along the line using a specified sampling distance (M3dimControl() with M_PROFILE_SAMPLE_SIZE) so that each point in the profile is at an equal distance away from the next. Note that when the destination is a result buffer, the profile contains valid points only; no profile points are extracted from gaps in the depth map. Invalid points can exist in the profile only when the destination is a container. You can retrieve results using M3dimGetResult(). To draw the profile, use M3dimDraw3d(). Alternatively, you can use MgraDots() or M3dgraDots() to draw the profile points. Parameters Parameters ProfileContext3dimId Specifies the identifier of the profile 3D image processing context. The context must have been allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_PROFILE_CONTEXT. SrcDepthBufId Specifies the identifier of the source depth map container or depth map image buffer. For specifying the source depth map container or depth map image buffer identifier Value Description Depth map container identifier Specifies the identifier of a depth map container. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must store data in a 3D-processable depth map format (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE). Depth map image buffer identifier Specifies the identifier of a depth map image buffer. The image buffer must be an 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit unsigned, 1-band buffer, and must contain a fully corrected depth map (that is, if you call McalInquire() with M_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE). The image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. DstContainerBufOrResult3dimId Specifies the identifier of the destination container or profile 3D image processing result buffer. For specifying the destination container or profile result buffer identifier Value Description Container identifier Specifies the identifier of a container. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must not be a child container. MIL profile 3D image processing result buffer identifier Specifies the identifier of a profile 3D image processing result buffer. The result buffer must have been previously allocated using M3dimAllocResult() with M_PROFILE_RESULT. Param1 Specifies the first parameter, which determines the units with which to interpret the Param2, Param3, Param4, and Param5 parameters. For specifying the input units Value Description M_PIXEL Specifies to interpret the values in pixel units. M_WORLD Specifies to interpret the values in world units. Param2 Specifies the X-coordinate of the first point that defines the line along which to extract points.

Syntax void M3dimProject( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcContainerBufOrGeometry3dgeoId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DepthMapImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;IntensityMapImageBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ProjectionMode, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;OverlapMode, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Options, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function projects a point cloud or a 3D geometry onto the XY (Z=0) plane, generating a fully corrected depth map. A depth map pixel's gray level indicates depth. M3dimProject() can also generate an intensity map image from the source container, if an appropriate component is available (M_COMPONENT_REFLECTANCE and/or M_COMPONENT_INTENSITY). An intensity map pixel's gray level indicates the luminosity of the original scene at the location represented by the corresponding pixel in the depth map. M3dimProject() projects the points of the point cloud on the XY (Z=0) plane of its working coordinate system. To change the resulting depth map, use M3dimRotate() or M3dimMatrixTransform() to rotate or transform (respectively) the 3D points before calling M3dimProject(). To define the region of the point cloud or 3D geometry to project, the destination buffer's size and camera calibration information are used to establish a bounding box. You can use M3dimCalculateMapSize() to establish the required destination depth map buffer size in X and Y, and M3dimCalibrateDepthMap() to calibrate the buffer(s). Alternatively, you can use M3dimLattice() to establish the required destination depth map buffer size in X and Y (M3dimGetResult() with M_NUMBER_OF_CELLS_...), and McalUniform() to manually calibrate the buffer(s), using M3dimGetResult() with M_START_POINT_... and M_CELL_SIZE_... to specify the translation and scale of the transformation between pixel and world units. For more information, see M3dimLattice(). If you want to limit which points are considered for the projection, prior to calling M3dimProject(), you can crop or mask the point cloud (using M3dimCrop() or changing the data in the source container's confidence component). For more information, see the Regions of interest subsection of the Working with 3D section of Chapter 2: Building an application. Note that, when generating an intensity map, the source container's reflectance or intensity component provides the color or intensity for pixels in the destination image. If both components exist, only the reflectance component is considered. You cannot generate an intensity map when projecting a 3D geometry. Parameters Parameters SrcContainerBufOrGeometry3dgeoId Specifies a source container or 3D geometry object. For specifying the source container or 3D geometry object identifier Value Description Source 3D geometry object identifier Specifies the identifier of a 3D geometry object, except that of a box geometry object. The 3D geometry object must have been previously allocated using M3dgeoAlloc() with M_GEOMETRY, and must have been successfully defined. Supported 3D geometries include cylinder, line, plane, point, and sphere. Source container identifier Specifies the identifier of the source container. The container must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE). The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC. DepthMapImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination depth map container or depth map image buffer, previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() or MbufAlloc2d(). To establish the required destination depth map buffer size in X and Y, use M3dimCalculateMapSize() or M3dimLattice(). The destination container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, must store data in a 3D-processable depth map format (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE), and must not be a child container. The destination image buffer must be fully corrected (that is, if you call McalInquire() with M_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE). This means that the buffer must be associated with a calibration context and have a constant pixel size in X and Y; it must also have a valid Z-scale. To establish the required calibration, use M3dimCalibrateDepthMap(), or use McalUniform() to calibrate the buffer and McalControl() with M_GRAY_LEVEL_SIZE_Z to set the Z-scale. Note that, depending on the Z-scale and offset of the destination image buffer, a point's Z-value can place it outside the buffer's range of possible values. By default, the point is ignored, but saturation to either 0 or the buffer's maximum value (minus 1) is possible with the Options parameter set to M_SATURATION. The destination image buffer must be an 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit unsigned buffer. IntensityMapImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination intensity map image buffer. The image buffer must have the same dimensions as the buffer specified for DepthMapImageBufId. In addition, the image buffer must be an 8-bit or 16-bit unsigned, 1-band or 3-band buffer. The number of bands must be equal to that of the component M_COMPONENT_REFLECTANCE or M_COMPONENT_INTENSITY. If the container has neither M_COMPONENT_REFLECTANCE nor M_COMPONENT_INTENSITY components, or if projecting a 3D geometry, this parameter must be set to M_NULL. ProjectionMode Specifies the projection mode. You must set this parameter to M_DEFAULT if the source is a 3D geometry object. For specifying the projection mode Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_POINT_BASED. M_MESH_BASED Specifies to consider the source container's mesh component when extracting 3D points for projection into the depth map. For a meshed point cloud, each triangular face has 3 vertices, and a vertex's Z-value determines the gray level of its corresponding pixel in the depth map. The remaining pixels (in the depth map) are assigned interpolated gray levels, since they correspond to the triangular faces between the vertices (in the point cloud's mesh). The container must have an M_COMPONENT_MESH_MIL component before using the M_MESH_BASED mode. M_POINT_BASED Specifies to project the 3D points directly into the depth map. OverlapMode Specifies the overlap mode, which determines a pixel's gray level when multiple points correspond to the same destination depth map pixel. For specifying the overlap mode Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_MAX_Z. M_AVERAGE Specifies to use the average gray level of all the 3D points projected on a single depth map pixel. M_MAX_INTENSITY Specifies to use the gray level of the 3D point with the highest intensity. The source container must have an intensity or reflectance component. Note that M_MAX_INTENSITY is not available when the source object is a 3D geometry. M_MAX_Z Specifies to use the gray level of the 3D point with the largest Z-value, of all the 3D points projected on a single depth map pixel. Note that this value can be bright or dark, depending on whether the Z-scale (M_GRAY_LEVEL_SIZE_Z) is positive or negative (if you calibrated the buffer using M3dimCalibrateDepthMap(), M3dimCalibrateDepthMap() with ZSign set to M_POSITIVE or M_NEGATIVE). M_MIN_Z Specifies to use the gray level of the 3D point with the smallest Z-value, of all the 3D points projected on a single depth map pixel. Note that this value can be dark or bright, depending on whether the Z-scale (M_GRAY_LEVEL_SIZE_Z) is positive or negative (if you calibrated the buffer using M3dimCalibrateDepthMap(), M3dimCalibrateDepthMap() with ZSign set to M_POSITIVE or M_NEGATIVE). M_OVERWRITE Specifies to use the last gray level of all the 3D points projected on a single depth map pixel. This mode continually overwrites the previous gray value for the pixel. M_OVERWRITE can be marginally faster than the other overlap modes. Options Specifies additional options. Note that you can combine the 2 values M_ACCUMULATE and M_SATURATION (that is, you can set the Options parameter to M_ACCUMULATE + M_SATURATION). For specifying the option Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies no saturation; points falling outside the depth map image buffer's grayscale range are ignored. M_ACCUMULATE Specifies not to clear the previous contents of the depth map image buffer prior to projection. M_SATURATION Specifies saturation. Note that saturation can occur, depending on the Z-scale and offset of the destination depth map buffer. If, for a given pixel of the destination buffer, the corresponding gray level of the 3D geometry or point of the point cloud falls outside the buffer's grayscale range, the pixel will be saturated to either 0 or the buffer's maximum value, minus 1 (the maximum value is reserved to represent missing data).

Syntax void M3dimRemapDepthMap( MIL_ID&nbsp;RemapContext3dimId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function linearly remaps source pixels to destination pixels according to the specified mode, which determines the range of Z-values (Z-range) for the destination depth map. Use M3dimControl() to set the remap mode (M_REMAP_MODE) and other remap options. Note that the remap operation maintains the same calibration in X and Y as the source buffer. You can use M3dimRemapDepthMap() to remap a depth map to a different data type. This allows you to pass the remapped depth map to functions that only accept image buffers of certain bit depths (for example, MmodFind()). You can limit this function's results to a region of an image buffer using a region of interest (ROI) set using MbufSetRegion(). The ROI must be defined in raster format (M_RASTER or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error is generated if the ROI is only in vector format (M_VECTOR). If both the source and the destination image buffers have an ROI, results are limited to the portion of the ROIs that intersect. Parameters Parameters RemapContext3dimId Specifies a remap 3D image processing context. For specifying the remap 3D image processing context identifier Value Description M_REMAP_CONTEXT_BUFFER_LIMITS Specifies a predefined remap 3D image processing context with all remap context control types (M3dimControl()) set to their default, including M_REMAP_MODE, which is set to M_BUFFER_LIMITS. Use this predefined context to remap the source depth map using its M_MIN and M_MAX as the values to define the destination's Z-range. M_REMAP_CONTEXT_DATA_EXTREMES Specifies a predefined remap 3D image processing context with all remap context control types (M3dimControl()) set to their default, except for M_REMAP_MODE, which is set to M_DATA_EXTREMES. Use this predefined context to remap the source depth map using its minimum and maximum pixel values to define the destination's Z-range. M_REMAP_CONTEXT_USE_DESTINATION Specifies a predefined remap 3D image processing context with all remap context control types (M3dimControl()) set to their default, except for M_REMAP_MODE, which is set to M_USE_DESTINATION_CALIBRATION. Use this predefined context to remap the source depth map using the destination image buffer's calibration information or destination container's scale, offset, and matrix information to define the destination's Z-range. MIL remap 3D image processing context identifier Specifies the identifier of a remap 3D image processing context, previously allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_REMAP_CONTEXT. In this case, the function applies the remap control settings specified using M3dimControl(). SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source depth map image buffer or depth map container. The image buffer must be a 1-band, 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit unsigned buffer, and must contain a fully corrected depth map (that is, if you call McalInquire() with M_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE). The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must store data in a 3D-processable depth map format (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE).

Syntax void M3dimRemovePoints( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcContainerBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstContainerBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Option, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function removes 3D points from a point cloud, based on a specified condition (for example, all invalid points). The specified points are removed from the point cloud, not just invalidated with the confidence component. The mesh component (if existing) is recalculated for the remaining points. If the point cloud has both intensity and reflectance components, the points' color or intensity data is assumed to be stored in the reflectance component. Consequently, the specified points' color or intensity data is removed from the reflectance component, while the intensity component is copied unchanged into the destination container. This is because, when both components exist in a point cloud, the intensity component often stores a photographic image of the source scene. A data correlation might or might not exist between the image and the container's 3D points, depending on the type of 3D sensor used to generate the data. If the intensity component or the reflectance component exists but not both, it is modified and copied to the destination container. Note that, if an M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL component exists in the source container, normal vectors of removed points are also removed; remaining point normals are not recalculated. The destination point cloud is always unorganized, meaning its data is stored in the destination container with 1D components. Parameters Parameters SrcContainerBufId Specifies the identifier of the source point cloud container. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE). DstContainerBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination container in which to place the modified point cloud. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must not be a child container. If, after the operation, there are no valid points remaining, the destination container's range component is reduced to 1x1 and its corresponding confidence equals 0. Option Specifies which points to remove. For specifying the option Value Description M_INVALID_NORMALS Specifies to remove points whose confidence is equal to zero, as well as points whose normal vector values are zero. Note that other points with non-unit normal vectors are not removed. This option is available only when the component M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL exists in the source point cloud container. M_INVALID_POINTS_ONLY Specifies to remove points whose confidence is equal to zero. M_NOT_MESH_POINTS Specifies to remove points whose confidence is equal to zero, as well as points that are not part of the mesh. This option is available only when the component M_COMPONENT_MESH_MIL exists in the source point cloud container. ControlFlag Specifies which components will be affected by the operation. For specifying whether to remove points from all components Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the operation will only affect the core components of a 3D-processable container. These core components are listed in the description of MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE. All other components are copied to the destination container unmodified. M_APPLY_TO_ALL_COMPONENTS Specifies that the operation will affect the core components of a 3D-processable container, as well as any other component (including custom components) that has the same dimension as M_COMPONENT_RANGE. These components must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with them. For example, using a component that is an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Note that if a custom component has an associated calibration context, the component has points removed, but its context is discarded. If the resulting operation yields an empty container with 0 valid points, the components with the same dimensions are not created and will not exist in the destination container.

Syntax MIL_ID M3dimRestore( MIL_CONST_TEXT_PTR&nbsp;FileName, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*Context3dimIdPtr //out ) Description This function restores a 3D image processing context that was previously saved to a file, using M3dimSave() or M3dimStream(). This function restores all of the 3D image processing context's settings that were in effect when it was saved. When the restored 3D image processing context is no longer required, release it using M3dimFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during restoration; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the 3D image processing context's lifetime and you must not manually free it. Parameters Parameters FileName Specifies the name and path of the file from which to restore the 3D image processing context. The function handles (internally) the opening and closing of the file. This parameter can be set to one of the following: For specifying the file name and path Value Description M_INTERACTIVE [This is only applicable to Windows] Opens the File Open dialog box from which you can interactively specify the drive, directory, and name of the file. MIL_TEXT(\"FileName\") 1 Specifies the drive, directory, and name of the file (for example, \"C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). Typically, 3D image processing context files have an M3DIM extension. To specify a file on a remote computer (under Distributed MIL), prefix the specified file name string with \"remote:///\" (for example, \"remote:///C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). 1 If you are passing the value in a variable, don't enclose it in MIL_TEXT(). SysId Specifies the system on which to restore the 3D image processing context. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the system identifier Value Description M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. Context3dimIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the 3D image processing context identifier or specifies the data type that the function should use to return the 3D image processing context identifier. For retrieving the identifier or specifying how to return it Value Description M_NULL Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated 3D image processing context ; in this case, a standard MIL identifier of type MIL_ID is returned. M_UNIQUE_ID Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated 3D image processing context ; in this case, a MIL smart identifier of type MIL_UNIQUE_3DIM_ID is returned instead of a standard MIL identifier. This setting is only available when using C++11 (or later). A MIL smart identifier manages the lifespan of the MIL object it owns (similar to a std::unique_ptr). Note, you can use a MIL smart identifier as though it were a standard MIL identifier, except that you cannot use it to manually free the 3D image processing context (it is freed automatically).

If the source is a point cloud container, M3dimRotate() applies the specified rotation to the coordinates in the M_COMPONENT_RANGE component. If a M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL component exists in the source container, it is recalculated and added to the destination container, along with the modified M_COMPONENT_RANGE component. The source container's M_COMPONENT_CONFIDENCE component is copied to the destination container. If M_COMPONENT_REFLECTANCE and M_COMPONENT_MESH_MIL components exist in the source, they are also copied to the destination. Any previously existing M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL, M_COMPONENT_REFLECTANCE, or M_COMPONENT_MESH_MIL components are removed from the destination container. Note that all angles should be specified in degrees. However, unlike most other MIL functions, angles are interpreted using the right-hand grip rule around the axis of rotation; if you wrap your right hand around the axis of rotation, pointing your thumb in the positive direction of the axis, your fingers wrap in the direction of rotation. For example, a positive rotation around the Z-axis corresponds to a rotation that turns the positive X-axis toward the positive Y-axis. All coordinates are expressed in world units in the working coordinate system. Note that, when rotating a point cloud, this function affects the coordinates of the points and not their storage location in the container. Parameters Parameters SrcContainerBufOrGeometry3dgeoId Specifies the source point cloud container or 3D geometry object. Note that the source and destination must match so that both are containers or both are 3D geometries. For specifying the source container or 3D geometry object identifier Value Description M_XY_PLANE Specifies the XY (Z=0) plane. Source 3D geometry object identifier Specifies the identifier of the source 3D geometry object. The 3D geometry object must have been previously allocated using M3dgeoAlloc() with M_GEOMETRY, and must have been successfully defined. Source container identifier Specifies the identifier of the source point cloud container. The container must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE). The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC. DstContainerBufOrGeometry3dgeoId Specifies the destination container or 3D geometry object.

Its definition is dependent on the type of rotation selected. Set this parameter to M_DEFAULT if not used. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Param3 Specifies an attribute of the rotation. Its definition is dependent on the type of rotation selected. Set this parameter to M_DEFAULT if not used. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Param4 Specifies an attribute of the rotation. Its definition is dependent on the type of rotation selected. Set this parameter to M_DEFAULT if not used. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. CenterX Specifies the X-coordinate of the point around which the rotation is performed. To specify the volumetric center point when rotating a 3D geometry, set this parameter to M_GEOMETRY_CENTER. To specify the volumetric center point or center of mass when rotating a point cloud, calculate (using M3dimStat()) and then retrieve (using M3dimGetResult()) the required bounding box (M_BOX_CENTER_...) or centroid (M_CENTROID_...) statistics (respectively), and then pass these coordinates to the CenterX, CenterY and CenterZ parameters. For specifying the X-coordinate value Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. M_GEOMETRY_CENTER Specifies the 3D geometry's center point. This setting is only applicable if the geometry is finite (for example, a box, sphere, or finite cylinder). Note that, if M_GEOMETRY_CENTER is specified, you must set CenterY and CenterZ to M_DEFAULT. Value Specifies the X-coordinate value. CenterY Specifies the Y-coordinate of the point around which the rotation is performed. If the CenterX parameter is set to M_GEOMETRY_CENTER, set this parameter to M_DEFAULT. For specifying the Y-coordinate value Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value Specifies the Y-coordinate value. CenterZ Specifies the Z-coordinate of the point around which the rotation is performed. If the CenterX parameter is set to M_GEOMETRY_CENTER, set this parameter to M_DEFAULT.

Syntax void M3dimSample( MIL_ID&nbsp;SampleContext3dimId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcContainerBufOrGeometry3dgeoId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstContainerBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function reduces the number of points in a point cloud (subsampling), increases the number of points in a meshed point cloud (surface sampling), or creates a point cloud from a 3D geometry. When subsampling a point cloud, the function subsamples the source container's point cloud (M_COMPONENT_RANGE and M_COMPONENT_CONFIDENCE components), and places the resulting less dense point cloud into the destination container. If an M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL component exists in the source container, it is subsampled and the new normals component is added to the destination container. Typically, the source container's M_COMPONENT_REFLECTANCE component (if it exists) is also subsampled. You can choose the type of subsampling operation to perform, using M3dimControl() with M_SUBSAMPLE_MODE. The grid operation (M_SUBSAMPLE_GRID) uses a lattice structure with a specified cell size to divide points into subgroups and selects a single point per cell. You can use M3dimLattice() to calculate the lattice required to retain a particular fraction of points from the source point cloud. You can copy lattice results into a subsample 3D image processing context, using M3dimCopyResult() with M_SUBSAMPLE_CONTEXT. When you call M3dimSample() with a subsample 3D image processing context containing lattice results, a grid operation is performed using the cell sizes of the lattice results (M3dimGetResult() with M_CELL_SIZE_...). When surface sampling a point cloud, the function samples the surface of a meshed point cloud, and places a denser (non-meshed) point cloud into the destination container. New M_COMPONENT_RANGE and M_COMPONENT_CONFIDENCE components are generated for the destination container, as well as a new M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL component (regardless of whether an M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL component exists in the source container). In addition, if the source container has an M_COMPONENT_REFLECTANCE component, destination reflectance values are interpolated for a destination M_COMPONENT_REFLECTANCE component. When surface sampling a finite 3D geometry, the function samples the geometry's surface, and generates the components M_COMPONENT_RANGE and M_COMPONENT_CONFIDENCE. A M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL component is also generated for box, cylinder, and sphere 3D geometries, but not for a point or line. Note that infinite 3D geometries (such as an infinite cylinder, line, or plane) are not supported. When using M3dimSample(), regardless of the existence of a mesh structure (M_COMPONENT_MESH_MIL component) associated with the source, the destination point cloud will not have a mesh structure; subsampling or surface sampling invalidates the mesh. If an M_COMPONENT_MESH_MIL component exists in the destination container, it is deleted. Note that, if the source container has both M_COMPONENT_REFLECTANCE and M_COMPONENT_INTENSITY components, the reflectance component is sampled or subsampled and the intensity component is copied to the destination container unmodified, unless the reflectance component is not in the right format. In this case, the intensity component is subsampled or surface sampled, with the resulting M_COMPONENT_INTENSITY component added to the destination container. If only 1 component of these types exist (reflectance or intensity), that component is subsampled or surface sampled. Note that by default, any component in the source container that is not listed above is copied to the destination unmodified, when subsampling or surface sampling a point cloud. For subsampling, you can use M_APPLY_TO_ALL_COMPONENTS to apply the operation to all other components in the container, including custom components. The components must have the same dimensions as M_COMPONENT_RANGE; otherwise, they will be copied to the destination unmodified. Parameters Parameters SampleContext3dimId Specifies a subsample or surface sample 3D image processing context. For specifying the subsample or surface sample 3D image processing context identifier Value Description MIL subsample 3D image processing context identifier Specifies the identifier of a subsample 3D image processing context, previously allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_SUBSAMPLE_CONTEXT. The function applies the subsample control settings specified using M3dimControl(). MIL surface sample 3D image processing context identifier Specifies the identifier of a surface sample 3D image processing context, previously allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_SURFACE_SAMPLE_CONTEXT. The function applies the surface sample control settings specified using M3dimControl(). SrcContainerBufOrGeometry3dgeoId Specifies the identifier of the source container containing a 3D-processable point cloud, or specifies the identifier of the source 3D geometry object. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE). The container must have the component M_COMPONENT_MESH_MIL for surface sampling. The 3D geometry object must have been previously allocated using M3dgeoAlloc() with M_GEOMETRY, and must have been successfully defined. Note that 3D geometries are supported for a surface sampling context only; the geometry cannot be infinite (such as an infinite cylinder, line, or plane). DstContainerBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination container in which to place the generated point cloud. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must not be a child container. ControlFlag Specifies which components will be affected by the operation. For a surface sample operation, this parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. For specifying whether to apply subsampling to all components Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the operation will only affect the core components of a 3D-processable container. These core components are listed in the description of MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE. All other components are copied to the destination container unmodified. M_APPLY_TO_ALL_COMPONENTS Specifies that the operation will affect the core components of a 3D-processable container, as well as any other component (including custom components) that has the same dimension as M_COMPONENT_RANGE. These components must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with them. For example, using a component that is an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Note that if a custom component has an associated calibration context, the component is subsampled, but its context is discarded. If the resulting operation yields an empty container with 0 valid points, the components with the same dimensions are not created and will not exist in the destination container. This option is only available for a subsample 3D image processing context. Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; mil3dim.lib. DLL Requires mil.dll; mil3dim.dll.

For specifying the X-coordinate value Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. M_GEOMETRY_CENTER Specifies the 3D geometry object's center point for a finite 3D geometry (for example, a box, sphere, or finite cylinder). Note that, if you specify M_GEOMETRY_CENTER, you must set CenterY and CenterZ to M_DEFAULT. Value Specifies the X-coordinate value. CenterY Specifies the Y-coordinate of the point that defines the center of the scaling operation. If the CenterX parameter is set to M_GEOMETRY_CENTER, set this parameter to M_DEFAULT. Note that sphere and box 3D geometries do not accept non-uniform scaling. For specifying the Y-coordinate value Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0.

Syntax void M3dimStat( MIL_ID&nbsp;StatContext3dimId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;MilObjectId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;StatResult3dimOrGeometry3dgeoId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function calculates a variety of statistics for the 3D points in a point cloud, for the real-world coordinates that correspond to pixels in a depth map, or for a 3D geometry. The specified statistics 3D image processing context establishes which statistics to calculate and how to calculate them. If you need to calculate one type of statistic and use default settings, you can use a predefined context; otherwise, use M3dimAlloc() to set up a custom context that you can control using M3dimControl(). For example, to calculate bounding box statistics for a point cloud or depth map, you can first enable the calculation (using M3dimControl() with M_BOUNDING_BOX and M_ENABLE), and then have the algorithm compute the axis-aligned box that contains most of the points but rejects outliers (M_BOUNDING_BOX_ALGORITHM set to M_ROBUST). Note that, if you use the default M_STAT_CONTEXT_BOUNDING_BOX context, M3dimStat() computes the bounding box of all valid points. Results are stored in the specified 3D statistics result buffer. For a 3D geometry, you can calculate bounding box and centroid statistics only. Note that, when you specify a destination 3D geometry, bounding box and centroid statistics are written directly to the specified 3D geometry object, which establishes the geometry as a 3D box or 3D point, respectively. After calling M3dimStat(), you can obtain the statistics from the result buffer using M3dimGetResult(). Note that there must be a sufficient number of valid points in the source container or image buffer for the statistics to be calculated. This means that there must be at least 2 valid points for M_STAT_CONTEXT_DISTANCE_TO_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR calculations, and at least 1 valid point for all other statistics types. In the case of an insufficient number of valid points, the result is typically 0; however, PCA or fixturing matrices return the identity matrix, and PCA axes return an axis-aligned coordinate system with vector coordinates (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). Also note that, for moments, if the specified powers in X, Y, and Z are all 0, the result is 1; otherwise, the result is 0. Parameters Parameters StatContext3dimId Specifies a previously allocated statistics 3D image processing context (used to evaluate multiple statistical calculations), or a predefined statistics 3D image processing context (used to evaluate a single statistical calculation). Set this parameter to one of the following: For specifying the statistics context Value Description M_STAT_CONTEXT_BOUNDING_BOX Specifies a predefined statistics 3D image processing context with the M_BOUNDING_BOX control type (M3dimControl()) set to M_ENABLE. For a point cloud or depth map, use this predefined context to calculate bounding box statistics using the default setting (M_ALL_POINTS), which includes all valid points; no valid points exist outside the bounding box. To exclude outliers, use a custom context and compute a bounding box that contains most of the valid points instead of all of them, using M3dimControl() with M_BOUNDING_BOX_ALGORITHM set to M_ROBUST. Note that, if the destination object (StatResult3dimOrGeometry3dgeoId) is a 3D geometry, this setting writes the calculated bounding box into the specified 3D geometry object directly. M_STAT_CONTEXT_CENTROID Specifies a predefined statistics 3D image processing context with the M_CENTROID control type (M3dimControl()) set to M_ENABLE. Use this predefined context to calculate centroid statistics. The centroid is the center of mass of a point cloud, depth map, or 3D geometry. Centroid statistics include the X-, Y-, and Z-coordinates of the centroid. Note that, if the destination object (StatResult3dimOrGeometry3dgeoId) is a 3D geometry, this setting writes the calculated centroid into the specified 3D geometry object directly. M_STAT_CONTEXT_DISTANCE_TO_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR Specifies a predefined statistics 3D image processing context with the M_DISTANCE_TO_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR control type (M3dimControl()) set to M_ENABLE. Use this predefined context to calculate distance-to-nearest-neighbor statistics, which include the average distance, the maximum distance, and the minimum distance of 3D points or real-world coordinates to their nearest neighbor. This predefined context is not available for 3D geometries. M_STAT_CONTEXT_NUMBER_OF_POINTS Specifies a predefined statistics 3D image processing context with the M_NUMBER_OF_POINTS control type (M3dimControl()) set to M_ENABLE. Use this predefined context to calculate number-of-points statistics, which include the total number of points, the number of points that are missing data (invalid points), and the number of valid points. This predefined context is not available for 3D geometries. M_STAT_CONTEXT_PCA Specifies a predefined statistics 3D image processing context with the M_PCA control type (M3dimControl()) set to M_ENABLE. Use this predefined context to calculate principle component analysis (PCA) statistics. This predefined context is not available for 3D geometries. M_STAT_CONTEXT_PCA_NORMALS Specifies a predefined statistics 3D image processing context with the M_PCA control type set to M_ENABLE, the M_PCA_MODE control type set to M_ORDINARY, and the M_COMPONENT_OF_INTEREST control type set to M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL (M3dimControl()). Use this predefined context to calculate principle component analysis (PCA) statistics on a point cloud's unit normal vectors. This predefined context is not available for depth maps or 3D geometries. M_STAT_CONTEXT_SEMI_ORIENTED_BOX Specifies a predefined statistics 3D image processing context with the M_BOUNDING_BOX control type set to M_ENABLE and the M_BOX_ORIENTATION control type set to M_SEMI_ORIENTED (M3dimControl()). Use this predefined context to calculate semi-oriented bounding box statistics, whereby the minimum volume bounding box is axis-aligned in Z but not in X and Y. To change the axis with which the semi-oriented bounding box is aligned, use a custom context and specify the axis using M_BOX_SEMI_ORIENTED_ROTATION_AXIS. For a point cloud or depth map, specifying this predefined context calculates semi-oriented bounding box statistics using the default algorithm (M_ALL_POINTS), which includes all valid points; no valid points exist outside the semi-oriented bounding box. To exclude outliers, use a custom context and compute a semi-oriented bounding box that contains most of the valid points instead of all of them, using M3dimControl() with M_BOUNDING_BOX_ALGORITHM set to M_ROBUST. MIL statistics 3D image processing context identifier Specifies the identifier of a statistics 3D image processing context, previously allocated using M3dimAlloc() with M_STATISTICS_CONTEXT. In this case, use M3dimControl() to enable the statistics type(s) and specify additional control settings. MilObjectId Specifies the identifier of the source container containing a 3D-processable point cloud or depth map, the identifier of the source depth map image buffer, or the identifier of the source 3D geometry object. Note that when M_COMPONENT_OF_INTEREST is set to M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL (using M3dimControl()), the source object must have normals. This means that the source cannot be a depth map image buffer, a point or line 3D geometry object, or a container without a normals component. For specifying the source container, image buffer, or 3D geometry object identifier Value Description Source 3D geometry object identifier Specifies the identifier of the source 3D geometry object. The 3D geometry object must have been previously allocated using M3dgeoAlloc() with M_GEOMETRY, and must have been successfully defined. Supported 3D geometries include box, cylinder, line, point, and sphere. Note that infinite 3D geometries (such as an infinite cylinder, an infinite line, or a plane) are not supported. Source depth map container identifier Specifies the identifier of the source depth map container. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must store data in a 3D-processable depth map format (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE). Source image buffer identifier Specifies the identifier of the source image buffer. The source image buffer must be a 1-band, 8-, 16-, or 32-bit unsigned buffer, and must be fully corrected (that is, if you call McalInquire() with M_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE). The source image buffer can have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it, but it must be a raster region. Using an image buffer with a non-raster type of ROI will cause an error. Source point cloud container identifier Specifies the identifier of the source point cloud container. The container must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE), and must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC. StatResult3dimOrGeometry3dgeoId Specifies the identifier of the statistics 3D image processing result buffer, or the identifier of a 3D geometry object. The result buffer must have been allocated using M3dimAllocResult() with M_STATISTICS_RESULT. The 3D geometry object must have been allocated using M3dgeoAlloc() with M_GEOMETRY.

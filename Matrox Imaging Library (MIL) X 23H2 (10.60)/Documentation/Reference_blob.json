Syntax MIL_ID MblobAlloc( MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ContextType, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*ContextBlobIdPtr //out ) Description This function allocates a blob analysis context. A blob analysis context contains all the information necessary to perform an MblobCalculate() operation, including global processing settings, and the blob features to calculate. Immediately after allocation, the context has only a few features enabled for calculation (for example, a blob's area). Use MblobControl() to enable addition features for calculation. When the blob analysis context is no longer required, release it using MblobFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during allocation; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the blob analysis context's lifetime and you must not manually free it. Parameters Parameters SysId Specifies the system on which to allocate the context. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the system Value Description M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). ContextType Reserved for future expansion. This parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion. This parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. ContextBlobIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the blob analysis context identifier or specifies the data type that the function should use to return the blob analysis context identifier. For retrieving the identifier or specifying how to return it Value Description M_NULL Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated blob analysis context ; in this case, a standard MIL identifier of type MIL_ID is returned. M_UNIQUE_ID Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated blob analysis context ; in this case, a MIL smart identifier of type MIL_UNIQUE_BLOB_ID is returned instead of a standard MIL identifier. This setting is only available when using C++11 (or later). A MIL smart identifier manages the lifespan of the MIL object it owns (similar to a std::unique_ptr). Note, you can use a MIL smart identifier as though it were a standard MIL identifier, except that you cannot use it to manually free the blob analysis context (it is freed automatically). For more information, see the MIL smart identifiers subsection of the MIL custom data types, void pointers, extensions, and portability functions section of Chapter 2: Building an application. Address in which to write the identifier Specifies the address of a MIL_ID in which to write the identifier of the allocated blob analysis context. If allocation fails, M_NULL is written as the identifier. Return value The returned value is the blob analysis context identifier either as a standard identifier (MIL_ID) or a smart identifier (MIL_UNIQUE_BLOB_ID). If allocation fails, M_NULL is returned (or nullptr if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified). Remark The prototypes of functions in the Mblob module changed as of MIL 10 PP2.

Syntax void MblobCalculate( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextBlobId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;BlobIdentImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;GrayImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;ResultBlobId //in ) Description This function calculates the specified features for all currently included blobs in the blob identifier image, and stores results in the specified result buffer. To specify the features to calculate, pass a blob analysis context that has the required features enabled for calculation. Use MblobControl() to enable the features. You can select the blobs on which to perform the calculations using MblobSelect(). Calculations of features with a binary definition (such as M_BREADTH) are performed using only the blob identifier image (BlobIdentImageBufId). If a feature with a grayscale definition (such as M_MAX_PIXEL) is enabled for calculation, you must pass a grayscale image buffer to the GrayImageBufId parameter. In this case, the blob identifier image is used to identify the blobs and the grayscale image is used to provide the blob pixel values. Note that the blob identifier image and the grayscale image must be the same size. Instead of passing the blob identifier image separately, you can associate an ROI with the grayscale image buffer and have the ROI act as the blob identifier image. The blob identifier image identifies each blob as a group of touching pixels in the current foreground state (zero or non-zero, based on MblobControl() with M_FOREGROUND_VALUE). The current M_CONNECTIVITY processing mode (also set with MblobControl()), determines when to consider pixels as touching. If the blob identifier image has been previously binarized so that it contains only two extreme values (0 and 1 for 1-bit images, 0 and 0xff for 8-bit images, and 0 and 0xffff for 16-bit images), blob analysis can be performed a little faster. However, you must first set MblobControl() with M_IDENTIFIER_TYPE to M_BINARY, to let MIL know that the blob identifier image has only two states. Depending on the blob identification mode (MblobControl() with M_BLOB_IDENTIFICATION_MODE), MblobCalculate() either treats each blob individually (M_INDIVIDUAL), groups all blobs together (M_WHOLE_IMAGE), groups blobs according to their actual pixel value in the blob identifier image (M_LABELED or M_LABELED_TOUCHING). Both M_LABELED and M_LABELED_TOUCHING treat blobs with the same pixel value as being grouped together. However, M_LABELED treats touching blobs as the same blob (regardless of their label); while M_LABELED_TOUCHING treats them as separate. If you are calculating chain features (enabled using MblobControl() with M_CHAINS or M_ALL_FEATURES), you cannot use MblobControl() with M_BLOB_IDENTIFICATION_MODE set to M_LABELED_TOUCHING. If several calls are made to MblobCalculate() with the same image, context, and result buffer, features calculated in one call remain in the result buffer and are not recalculated in subsequent calls. However, if you then use the result buffer with different images or if you change the blob analysis context's processing settings using MblobControl() (constants from the For global processing settings of a blob analysis context that cause results to be recalculated table), any results already in the buffer become invalid and are discarded. Therefore, it is more efficient to use a result buffer exclusively in one processing mode with one blob identifier image (or one identifier/grayscale image pair if features with a grayscale definition are needed). If you have associated the blob identifier image with a camera calibration context, and GrayImageBufId is set to M_NULL, the result buffer will be associated with the same camera calibration context as the blob identifier image. However, if you provide a grayscale image that is not calibrated or does not have the same camera calibration context as the blob identifier image, the result buffer will not be calibrated (both the identifier and grayscale images must have the same camera calibration context for the result buffer to be calibrated). You can limit blob analysis calculations to a region of the blob identifier image using a region of interest (ROI) set using MbufSetRegion(). In this case, the specified features are only calculated for included blobs (or parts of blobs) lying within the ROI. Alternatively, you can define an ROI for the grayscale image. In this case, the ROI of the grayscale image is used as the blob identifier image and BlobIdentImageBufId must be set to M_NULL. For more information, see the Regions of interest subsection of the Child buffers, regions of interest, and fixturing section of Chapter 2: Building an application. When calculating depth map related features (using MblobControl() with M_DEPTH_MAP_...), you must set BlobIdentImageBufId to M_NULL, and GrayImageBufId to a fully corrected depth map that is associated with an ROI that acts as the blob identifier image as well as identifies invalid pixels. Note that if you don't pass a fully corrected depth map, you will obtain an error if you try to retrieve a depth map feature result using MblobGetResult(); MblobCalculate() will not generate an error. Use MbufSetRegion() with M_RASTERIZE_DEPTH_MAP_VALID_PIXELS to associate an ROI with the specified depth map. Most feature calculations are initially performed in the pixel coordinate system. It is typically possible to transform the result of these calculations to the relative coordinate system using MblobControl() with M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS. Those feature types whose calculation are not performed in the pixel coordinate system, or that cannot be transformed into the relative coordinate system, will have that fact stated in the result type's description in MblobGetResult(). Refer to the description of a particular feature's result, in MblobGetResult(), to determine if it can be transformed and returned in the relative coordinate system. Note that some feature results such as M_NUMBER_OF_HOLES do not have a different meaning in either the pixel coordinate system or the relative coordinate system. Parameters Parameters ContextBlobId Specifies the identifier of the blob analysis context, that specifies the feature(s) to calculate, and other settings related to the blob analysis operation. The blob analysis context must have been previously allocated on the required system with MblobAlloc(). BlobIdentImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the image buffer to use as the blob identifier image. This image is used to distinguish blob pixels from background pixels and which pixels belong to which blob. The blob identifier image buffer must be a packed binary, 8-, 16-, or 32-bit unsigned, single-band image buffer. 32-bit image buffers are only supported when the blob identification mode is set to M_LABELED_TOUCHING. This image buffer can have a region of interest (ROI) defined using MbufSetRegion(). The region must be defined in raster format (M_RASTER or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error is generated if the ROI is only in vector format (M_VECTOR). You can set this parameter to M_NULL to use the ROI of the grayscale image buffer as the blob identifier image. An error is generated if this parameter is set to M_NULL and there is either no grayscale image, or the grayscale image has no associated ROI. GrayImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the image buffer to use as the grayscale image. This image is used to supply the intensity of blob pixels when calculating features with a grayscale definition. If this parameter is set to M_NULL, features with a grayscale definition, such as M_SUM_PIXEL, cannot be calculated. This parameter is ignored when calculating features with only a binary definition. The grayscale image buffer must be an 8-bit or 16-bit, unsigned, single band image buffer. This image buffer can have a region of interest (ROI) defined using MbufSetRegion(). The region must be defined in raster format (M_RASTER or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error will be generated if the ROI is only in vector format (M_VECTOR). ResultBlobId Specifies the identifier of a blob analysis result buffer, in which to store calculated results. The blob analysis result buffer must have been previously allocated on the required system using MblobAllocResult(). Remark The prototypes of functions in the Mblob module changed as of MIL 10 PP2.

Syntax void MblobControl( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextOrResultBlobId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlType, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;ControlValue //in ) Description This function allows you to control a setting of the specified blob analysis context or result buffer. For blob analysis contexts, these settings control the execution of MblobCalculate(), and which blob features are enabled for calculation. For blob analysis result buffers, these settings control the post-manipulation of results. If MblobControl() is not called, default processing controls and values are used in calculations. You can inquire about most of these settings using MblobInquire(). Changing certain control type settings will cause MblobCalculate() to discard all results currently in your result buffer prior to calculation. If this is the case, it will be mentioned in the preamble to the table containing these control types. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler) in 64-bit mode, MblobControl() internally calls the MIL_DOUBLE version of this function (MblobControlDouble()). If you need to pass large integer values (including pointers), call the MIL_INT64 version of this function (MblobControlInt64()). Parameters Parameters ContextOrResultBlobId Specifies the identifier of the blob analysis context or result buffer. ControlType Specifies the setting to change.

Changing the value of the following control types between calls to MblobCalculate() will cause all the results currently in your Blob analysis result buffer to be discarded upon the next call to MblobCalculate(). For global processing settings of a blob analysis context that cause results to be recalculated ControlType Description ControlValue M_BLOB_IDENTIFICATION_MODE Sets whether to calculate features for each blob, or to treat groups of blobs as single blobs and calculate the features of these blobs as if they were one blob. M_DEFAULT Same as M_INDIVIDUAL. M_INDIVIDUAL Specifies that all blobs are measured individually. M_LABELED Specifies that blobs with the same label are grouped together, and that touching blobs with different labels are also grouped together. The foreground value of the blob identifier image will be used as the label value of the blob; therefore, when using M_LABELED, the M_FOREGROUND_VALUE control type cannot be set to M_ZERO, and the identifier image cannot be binary (1-bit). M_LABELED is not supported for merge operations using MblobMerge(). M_LABELED_TOUCHING Specifies that blobs with the same label are grouped together, and that touching blobs with different labels are measured individually. The foreground value of the blob identifier image will be used as the label value of the blob; therefore, when using M_LABELED_TOUCHING, the M_FOREGROUND_VALUE control type cannot be set to M_ZERO. In addition, the blob identifier image cannot be binary (1-bit). M_LABELED_TOUCHING is not supported with the following: MblobCalculate(), when chain features are enabled for calculation (MblobControl() with M_CHAINS, or M_ALL_FEATURES). MblobDraw() with M_DRAW_BLOBS_CONTOUR, M_DRAW_HOLES_CONTOUR, or a combination of the two. MblobSelect() with M_MERGE. M_WHOLE_IMAGE Specifies that all blobs are grouped together. If the blob identifier image is already binarized (for example, pixel values for an 8-bit image are either 0 or 0xff), you can set M_IDENTIFIER_TYPE to M_BINARY to calculate features faster. M_CONNECTIVITY Sets the image lattice for blob analysis. M_DEFAULT Same as M_8_CONNECTED. M_4_CONNECTED Specifies that each pixel has 4 neighbors. M_8_CONNECTED Specifies that each pixel has 8 neighbors. M_FERET_ANGLE_SEARCH_END Sets the upper limit of the angular search range in which to search for the maximum (M_FERET_MAX_DIAMETER) or minimum (M_FERET_MIN_DIAMETER) Feret diameters. Note that MblobCalculate() only searches through the specified range when calculating Feret features. Better results for the features can exist outside of this search range. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 180. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 180 Specifies the upper limit of the angular search range. The end value must be greater than the start value. M_FERET_ANGLE_SEARCH_START Sets the lower limit of the angular search range in which to search for the maximum (M_FERET_MAX_DIAMETER) or minimum (M_FERET_MIN_DIAMETER) Feret diameters. Note that MblobCalculate() only searches through the specified range when calculating Feret features. Better results for the features can exist outside of this search range. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 180 Specifies the lower limit of the angular search range. The start value must be less than the end value. M_FOREGROUND_VALUE Sets which pixel values are considered to be in the foreground. M_DEFAULT Same as M_NONZERO. M_NONZERO Specifies the blobs consisting of non-zero pixels. M_ZERO Specifies the blobs consisting of zero pixels. M_NUMBER_OF_FERETS Sets the number of Feret angles to use when calculating a Feret feature (M_FERET_...) or a feature based on Ferets (that is, M_RECTANGULARITY, M_ROUGHNESS, or M_CONVEX_PERIMETER). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 8. M_INFINITE Specifies the use of a high precision algorithm to accurately calculate Feret features (and features based on Feret features). The M_FERET_DIAMETERS result type is not supported when you use this setting. M_MIN_FERETS Specifies the minimum number of Feret angles. The minimum number of Feret angles is 2. Value &gt; M_MIN_FERETS Specifies the number of Feret angles. The first Feret angle used is always 0°, and the difference between successive angles is 180° / number of Ferets. For the following global processing setting control types, you must set the ContextOrResultBlobId parameter to a blob analysis context. These control types do not cause any results currently in the result buffer to be discarded when MblobCalculate() is called. For global processing settings of a blob analysis context that do not cause results to be recalculated ControlType Description ControlValue M_FERET_CONTACT_POINTS Sets whether to calculate Feret contact points for features that support it (for example, M_FERET_AT_PRINCIPAL_AXIS_ANGLE) if the feature has been enabled for calculation. This enables the use of the M_FERET_CONTACT_POINTS_... combination constants in MblobGetResult(). M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that the Feret contact points for supported features will not be calculated. M_ENABLE Specifies that the Feret contact points for supported features will be calculated. M_FERET_GENERAL_ANGLE Sets the angle to use when calculating M_FERET_GENERAL. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. -360.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 360.0 Specifies the angle, in degrees. M_IDENTIFIER_TYPE Sets the values that non-zero pixels in the blob identifier image can have. If the blob identifier image is already binarized (for example, pixel values for an 8-bit image are either 0 or 0xff), you can set this control type to M_BINARY to calculate features faster. M_DEFAULT Same as M_GRAYSCALE. M_BINARY Specifies that non-zero pixels must have the maximum value of the buffer (for example, 0xff for an 8-bit image). M_GRAYSCALE Specifies that non-zero pixels can have any value. M_MAX_BLOBS Sets the maximum number of blobs to process. If this number is reached, processing is stopped, and results available in the result buffer become invalid and are discarded unless M_RETURN_PARTIAL_RESULTS is enabled. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that there is no limit on the maximum number of blobs. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the maximum number of blobs. M_MOMENT_GENERAL_MODE Sets the type of moment to calculate when calculating a user-specified moment (M_MOMENT_GENERAL). M_DEFAULT Same as M_ORDINARY. M_CENTRAL Specifies a central moment. A central moment is defined as , where i runs from 1 to the number of pixels in the blob, pi = value of a pixel (always 1 for binary moments), xi = its X-coordinate, yi = its Y-coordinate, = the weighted mean of xi , = the weighted mean of yi , q and r are the order of the moment in X and Y respectively. The weighted mean is the first-order ordinary moment divided by the sum of the pixel values (M_SUM_PIXEL for grayscale definitions, M_AREA for binary definitions). Central moments use coordinates relative to each blob's center of gravity, and are therefore independent of a blob's position within an image. M_ORDINARY Specifies an ordinary moment. An ordinary moment is defined as , where i runs from 1 to the number of pixels in the blob, pi = value of a pixel (always 1 for binary moments), xi = its X-coordinate, yi = its Y-coordinate, and (q + r) are the order of the moment in X and Y respectively. Ordinary moments are affected by the blob position because they use coordinates relative to the image origin (top-left corner). M_MOMENT_GENERAL_ORDER_X Sets the order of the X-component of the user-specified moment. Use this control type when calculating a user-specified moment (M_MOMENT_GENERAL). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the X-order of the moment. M_MOMENT_GENERAL_ORDER_Y Sets the order of the Y-component of the user-specified moment. Use this control type when calculating a user-specified moment (M_MOMENT_GENERAL). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the Y-order of the moment. M_MOMENT_THIRD_ORDER_MODE Sets how to calculate third-order moments. M_FAST is faster than M_PRECISE, but it might cause some imprecisions. M_DEFAULT Same as M_FAST. M_FAST Specifies that third-order moments will be calculated quickly. M_PRECISE Specifies that third-order moments will be calculated accurately. M_PIXEL_ASPECT_RATIO Sets the pixel aspect ratio of the image(s). This is only useful if the image has a uniform pixel aspect ratio with different X- and Y-scales. For non-uniform distortion, you can use McalGrid() or McalList() to calibrate the image, and McalTransformImage() to physically correct the image. All results returned by MblobGetResult() are affected by M_PIXEL_ASPECT_RATIO, including those that are simply positions within the image. For more information, see the Pixel aspect ratio subsection of the Adjusting blob analysis processing controls section of Chapter 6: Blob analysis. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the pixel width/pixel height. M_RETURN_PARTIAL_RESULTS Sets whether results from partially scanned images will be available after a stop condition is met. The three stop conditions are: The maximum number of blobs (M_MAX_BLOBS) has been processed. The timeout limit (M_TIMEOUT) is exceeded. The calculation has been stopped by the user (M_STOP_CALCULATE). When a stop condition is met, the image is only partially scanned and results about blobs found in the partially scanned image are discarded. When M_RETURN_PARTIAL_RESULTS is set to M_ENABLE, you can access the results of those blobs that are completely defined (those blobs whose entire perimeter was scanned) in the partially scanned image. Note that when using multi-processing (MappControlMp() with M_MP_USE set to M_ENABLE) and this control type is enabled, it is possible that the number of blobs returned can exceed the number set using M_MAX_BLOBS. This is because multi-processing might divide the image into pieces and process each piece independently; in this case, there is no global number of blobs counted for the entire image until everything is processed. When a stop condition is met in one of the image pieces, processing is stopped everywhere. The total number of blobs is then combined and returned, which can be greater than M_MAX_BLOBS. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to discard results of partially scanned images when processing is interrupted. M_ENABLE Specifies to make results of partially scanned images available when processing is interrupted. M_SAVE_RUNS Sets whether to save run information when calling MblobCalculate(). M_DEFAULT Same as M_ENABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies not to save run information. Disabling saves time when performing the first call to MblobCalculate() and reduces the memory requirements for the result buffer. However, you cannot use MblobLabel(), or MblobGetLabel(), and certain draw operations are disabled. See MblobDraw() for more information on which draw operations require run information to be saved. In addition, using MblobControl(), you cannot enable for calculation the chained pixels features (M_CHAINS), the convex hull features (M_CONVEX_HULL), M_NUMBER_OF_FERETS when it is set to M_INFINITE, and the Feret features (M_FERETS). M_ENABLE Specifies to save run information. Calls to MblobCalculate() will save run information from the blob identifier image in the result buffer. M_SORTn Sets the feature to use as the n th sorting key for results, where n stands for an integer between 1 and 3. Changes to this control type take effect upon the next call to MblobCalculate(). If you select a feature as a sorting key that is not enabled, an error will occur on the next call to MblobCalculate(). M_DEFAULT Same as M_NO_SORT. M_AREA Specifies to sort by the number of foreground pixels in each blob (holes are not counted). M_AXIS_PRINCIPAL_ANGLE Specifies to sort by the angle, in degrees, at which each blob has the least moment of inertia. M_AXIS_SECONDARY_ANGLE Specifies to sort by the angle perpendicular to M_AXIS_PRINCIPAL_ANGLE of each blob, in degrees.

You can retrieve results for this feature using MblobGetResult() with M_SUM_PIXEL_SQUARED. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that this feature will not be calculated. M_ENABLE Specifies that this feature will be calculated. The following control types establish which of the features, that have both a binary and a grayscale definition, are calculated for each blob. The binary definition considers all pixels equal; the grayscale definition weighs pixels by their value in the grayscale image (the grayscale definition is much slower to calculate). When you do not specify a combination value for the following control types, both versions of the feature (or groups of features) are enabled for calculation by default. If you do not provide a grayscale image to MblobCalculate(), only the binary version can be calculated. Specifying a combination value for the following control types will overwrite the settings that were set when no combination value was specified. If a combination value was initially specified for a control type, and a different setting was specified for the same control type without a combination value, it will also overwrite the previous setting. For example, if you specify M_MOMENT_GENERAL with M_ENABLE, both the binary and grayscale versions of the feature will be calculated. If you subsequently specify M_MOMENT_GENERAL + M_GRAYSCALE with M_DISABLE, only the binary version of the feature will be calculated. For the following control types, you must set the ContextOrResultBlobId parameter to a blob analysis context. For specifying to calculate features with two definitions (binary and grayscale) ControlType Description ControlValue M_CENTER_OF_GRAVITY Sets whether to calculate both X- and Y-coordinates of the center of gravity.

You can retrieve results for these features using MblobGetResult() with M_MOMENT_X0_Y1, and M_MOMENT_X1_Y0. To calculate higher order moments, use M_MOMENT_SECOND_ORDER for predefined second-order moments, M_MOMENT_THIRD_ORDER for predefined third-order moments, or M_MOMENT_GENERAL for user-specified moments. Note that first-order moment features are calculated faster when using M_MOMENT_FIRST_ORDER than when using M_MOMENT_GENERAL. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that these features will not be calculated. M_ENABLE Specifies that these features will be calculated. M_MOMENT_GENERAL Sets whether to calculate a user-specified moment.

You can retrieve results for this feature using MblobGetResult() with M_MOMENT_GENERAL. You could alternatively enable the calculation of M_MOMENT_FIRST_ORDER, M_MOMENT_SECOND_ORDER, or M_MOMENT_THIRD_ORDER to calculate a set of first, second, or third-order moments, respectively. Note that first and second-order moment features are calculated faster when using M_MOMENT_FIRST_ORDER or M_MOMENT_SECOND_ORDER than when using M_MOMENT_GENERAL. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE.

You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to set whether to enable, disable, or sort on only the binary or grayscale calculation of the feature. Note that this combination is essential for some values. Refer to the individual values to determine if this is the case. For control values of the M_SORTn control type, this combination is essential (that is, you must add one of these combination values to the control value). For feature parameters that have two definitions Combination value Description M_BINARY Selects the binary definition of the selected feature. M_GRAYSCALE Selects the grayscale definition of the selected feature. The following control types establish which of the features, that are related to depth maps, are calculated for each blob. These blob features can only be calculated if you pass MblobCalculate() a grayscale image that is a fully corrected depth map, and is associated with an ROI that acts as the blob identifier image as well as identifies invalid pixels. You can verify that the grayscale image is a fully corrected depth map using McalInquire() with M_DEPTH_MAP. You can use MbufSetRegion() with M_RASTERIZE_DEPTH_MAP_VALID_PIXELS to merge confidence information with the blob identifier image. For the following control types, you must set the ContextOrResultBlobId parameter to a blob analysis context. For specifying to calculate features related to depth maps ControlType Description ControlValue M_DEPTH_MAP_MAX_ELEVATION Sets whether to calculate the maximum elevation of a blob. The M_DEPTH_MAP_MAX_ELEVATION result will be available only if the grayscale image is a fully corrected depth map. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that the maximum elevation of the blob will not be calculated. M_ENABLE Specifies that the maximum elevation of the blob will be calculated. M_DEPTH_MAP_MEAN_ELEVATION Sets whether to calculate the mean elevation of a blob. The M_DEPTH_MAP_MEAN_ELEVATION result will be available only if the grayscale image is a fully corrected depth map. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that the mean elevation of the blob will not be calculated. M_ENABLE Specifies that the mean elevation of the blob will be calculated. M_DEPTH_MAP_MIN_ELEVATION Sets whether to calculate the minimum elevation of a blob. The M_DEPTH_MAP_MIN_ELEVATION result will be available only if the grayscale image is a fully corrected depth map. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that the minimum elevation of the blob will not be calculated. M_ENABLE Specifies that the minimum elevation of the blob will be calculated. M_DEPTH_MAP_SIZE_Z Sets whether to calculate the Z-size (difference between maximum and minimum elevation) of a blob. The M_DEPTH_MAP_SIZE_Z result will be available only if the grayscale image is a fully corrected depth map. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that the Z-size of the blob will not be calculated. M_ENABLE Specifies that the Z-size of the blob will be calculated. M_DEPTH_MAP_VOLUME Sets whether to calculate the volume of a blob. The M_DEPTH_MAP_VOLUME result will be available only if the grayscale image is a fully corrected depth map. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that the volume of the blob will not be calculated. M_ENABLE Specifies that the volume of the blob will be calculated. For the following control types, you must set the ContextOrResultBlobId parameter to a blob analysis result buffer. For a blob analysis result buffer ControlType Description ControlValue M_INDEX_MODE Sets the index mode to use when retrieving results using MblobGetResult() and when drawing results using MblobDraw(). M_DEFAULT Same as M_USE_MACRO. M_INDEX Specifies that the index will be passed directly to the LabelOrIndex parameter of MblobGetResult() or MblobDraw(), without any macros. M_LABEL Specifies that the label will be passed directly to the LabelOrIndex parameter of MblobGetResult() or MblobDraw(), without any macros.

Note that M_USE_MACRO cannot be used in M_LABELED_TOUCHING mode with a 32-bit blob identifier image. M_INPUT_SELECT_UNITS Sets which units to use with the CondLow and CondHigh parameters of the MblobSelect() function, when specifying the limit values of the blob selection condition. This essentially sets the input coordinate system to use. M_PIXEL Specifies that the limit values passed to MblobSelect() be interpreted in pixel units, with respect to the pixel coordinate system. This is the default value. M_WORLD Specifies that the limit values passed to MblobSelect() be interpreted in world units, with respect to the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, calling MblobSelect() generates an error if the specified result buffer is not associated with a camera calibration context. M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS Sets whether to return results in pixels or world units. This essentially sets the output coordinate system to use. The setting of this control type will only affect functions within this module which return positional results. This control type can be changed at any time to return results in the required output units. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ACCORDING_TO_CALIBRATION. M_ACCORDING_TO_CALIBRATION Specifies that results are returned in world units if the result was calculated on an image associated with a camera calibration context; otherwise, specifies that results are returned in pixel units. M_PIXEL Specifies that results are returned in pixel units, with respect to the pixel coordinate system. M_WORLD Specifies that results are returned in world units, with respect to the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, calling MblobGetResult() generates an error if the result was not calculated on a calibrated image. M_STOP_CALCULATE Stops the current blob analysis calculation. You must call MblobControl() with M_STOP_CALCULATE from another thread (typically of higher priority). Results already available in the result buffer become invalid and will be discarded, unless M_RETURN_PARTIAL_RESULTS is enabled. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default behavior. Remark The prototypes of functions in the Mblob module changed as of MIL 10 PP2. For C applications, by default the original prototypes are used to ensure backward-compatibility. To use the updated prototypes, add #define M_USE_OLD_MBLOB_API_IN_C 0 before including mil.h.

Syntax void MblobDraw( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextGraId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;ResultBlobId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufOrListGraId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Operation, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;LabelOrIndex, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function draws specific blob features, which were calculated using MblobCalculate(), in the destination image buffer or 2D graphics list. This function can draw multiple features at a time. You can draw results obtained relative to an offset, at the top-left corner of the destination image, using MgraControl() with M_DRAW_OFFSET_X and M_DRAW_OFFSET_Y and zoom them using MgraControl() with M_DRAW_ZOOM_X and M_DRAW_ZOOM_Y. For example, you can draw a zoomed section of the blobs found in the target image at the top-left corner of the destination image. For more information, see the Drawing graphics with offset and zoom subsection of the Drawing graphics section of Chapter 26: Generating graphics. Parameters Parameters ContextGraId Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics context to use when drawing. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For specifying the 2D graphics context Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the default 2D graphics context of the current MIL application is used. Note that there is a different default 2D graphics context for each thread. MIL 2D graphics context identifier Specifies a valid 2D graphics context identifier, which you have allocated using MgraAlloc(). ResultBlobId Specifies the identifier of the blob analysis result buffer from which to retrieve the features to draw. DstImageBufOrListGraId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer or 2D graphics list in which to draw. The buffer can be any valid MIL image buffer allocated using MbufAlloc...(). The 2D graphics list must be previously allocated using MgraAllocList(). By drawing into a display's overlay buffer or associating the 2D graphics list with the display, you can also annotate an image non-destructively. If specifying an image buffer, it must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Operation Specifies the type of operation to perform. The values in the tables below can be added together to draw multiple features at a time. For example, to draw the contour, holes, and position of the blobs, you would specify M_DRAW_BLOBS_CONTOUR + M_DRAW_HOLES + M_DRAW_POSITION. The following operations can draw in a destination image buffer or 2D graphics list. For specifying the type of operation Value Description M_DRAW_AXIS Draws a cross at the blobs' center of gravity, respecting the principal and secondary axes. Note that to perform this operation, one feature among M_AXIS_PRINCIPAL_ANGLE or M_AXIS_SECONDARY_ANGLE must have been calculated using the binary definition. M_DRAW_BLOBS Draws the blobs. Note that to perform this operation, runs must have been previously saved using MblobControl() with M_SAVE_RUNS set to M_ENABLE. When drawing in either an image buffer or a 2D graphics list, MgraControl() with M_INPUT_UNITS cannot be set to M_WORLD for this operation. M_DRAW_BLOBS_CONTOUR Draws the external outline of the blobs. Note that to perform this operation, runs must have been previously saved using MblobControl() with M_SAVE_RUNS set to M_ENABLE. Also note that when using MblobControl() with M_BLOB_IDENTIFICATION_MODE set to either M_WHOLE_IMAGE or M_LABELED, both the blob and hole contours will be drawn when performing this operation. If M_BLOB_IDENTIFICATION_MODE is set to M_LABELED_TOUCHING, you cannot specify M_DRAW_BLOBS_CONTOUR. When drawing in either an image buffer or a 2D graphics list, MgraControl() with M_INPUT_UNITS cannot be set to M_WORLD for this operation. M_DRAW_BOX Draws the image-axis aligned bounding box of each blob. The image-axis-aligned bounding box is the bounding box that is aligned with the pixel coordinate system's axes. Note that to perform this operation, the M_BOX feature must have been calculated. M_DRAW_BOX_CENTER Draws a cross at the center of the blobs' bounding box. Note that to perform this operation, the M_BOX feature must have been calculated. M_DRAW_CENTER_OF_GRAVITY Same as M_DRAW_POSITION. M_DRAW_CONVEX_HULL Draws the convex hull of the blobs.

The line's end points are tangent to the Feret diameter's contact points. Note that to perform this operation, the following features must have been calculated: M_BOX, M_FERET_MAX_DIAMETER, and M_FERET_MAX_ANGLE. M_DRAW_FERET_MIN Draws the blobs' minimum Feret diameter, using an H-type line (|-|) that passes through the center of the blob's bounding box at the minimum Feret diameter's angle. The line's end points are tangent to the Feret diameter's contact points. Note that to perform this operation, the following features must have been calculated: M_BOX, M_FERET_MIN_DIAMETER, and M_FERET_MIN_ANGLE. M_DRAW_HOLES Draws the holes of the blobs.

When drawing in either an image buffer or a 2D graphics list, MgraControl() with M_INPUT_UNITS cannot be set to M_WORLD for this operation. M_DRAW_HOLES_CONTOUR Draws the outline of the blobs' holes. Note that to perform this operation, runs must have been previously saved using MblobControl() with M_SAVE_RUNS set to M_ENABLE. Also note that when using MblobControl() with M_BLOB_IDENTIFICATION_MODE set to either M_WHOLE_IMAGE or M_LABELED, both the blob and hole contours will be drawn when performing this operation. If M_BLOB_IDENTIFICATION_MODE is set to M_LABELED_TOUCHING, you cannot draw the blobs' holes with M_DRAW_HOLES_CONTOUR.

Syntax MIL_INT MblobGetLabel( MIL_ID&nbsp;ResultBlobId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;XPos, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;YPos, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;*LabelVarPtr //out ) Description This function gets the label value of a specified blob. Label values are used, for example, to obtain calculation results for single blobs. Blob label values must have been generated by calling MblobCalculate(). Parameters Parameters ResultBlobId Specifies the identifier of the blob analysis result buffer where the labels are stored. Note, this function cannot obtain the label values of blobs that have been deleted from the result buffer with MblobSelect(). XPos Specifies the X-coordinate of the blob. YPos Specifies the Y-coordinate of the blob. LabelVarPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the label value. If there is no blob at the specified location, the blob has been deleted, or if the blob's XPos and YPos lie outside the original identifier image, M_NULL is returned instead of the label value. Also, since MblobGetLabel() returns the label value, you can set this parameter to M_NULL. Return value The returned value is the label value of the specified blob. Remark The prototypes of functions in the Mblob module changed as of MIL 10 PP2. For C applications, by default the original prototypes are used to ensure backward-compatibility. To use the updated prototypes, add #define M_USE_OLD_MBLOB_API_IN_C 0 before including mil.h. For information about the original API for the Mblob module refer to the MIL 10 PP1 documentation, available online to registered users at https://www.matrox.com/imaging/mil_help.

      "text": " MblobGetResult Synopsis Get results for a feature of the included blobs, from a blob result buffer. Syntax void MblobGetResult( MIL_ID&nbsp;ResultBlobId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;LabelOrIndex, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ResultType, //in void&nbsp;*ResultArrayPtr //out ) Description This function retrieves the results for a specified feature of one or all included blobs, from the specified blob analysis result buffer. If your target image was associated with a camera calibration context, positional and dimensional results are, by default, returned with respect to the relative coordinate system of the image. Otherwise, these results are returned in pixels, relative to the top-left pixel in the target image. If your target image was associated with a camera calibration context but you want to retrieve positional and dimensional results in pixel units, use MblobControl() with the M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS control type set to M_PIXEL. Note that if you set M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS to M_WORLD without having specified a calibrated image from which to calculate the results, MblobGetResult() will generate an error. When calculated in pixel units, the pixel aspect ratio, specified using MblobControl() with M_PIXEL_ASPECT_RATIO, is taken into account horizontally. Results are returned in units of \"pixel height\" since the pixel width is adjusted to be equal to the pixel height. Note that MblobGetResult() generates an error if you try to retrieve a result whose corresponding feature, or the group of features to which it belongs, was not enabled for calculation. You can add the M_AVAILABLE combination constant to a feature to determine if the result is available for retrieval. Parameters Parameters ResultBlobId Specifies the identifier of the blob analysis result buffer from which to get results. The specified feature(s) must have already been calculated with MblobCalculate(). LabelOrIndex Specifies the label or index of the blob for which to get results, or specifies that you are getting general results related to all blobs. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For specifying the label or index of the blob Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_INCLUDED_BLOBS for features that apply to one or all occurrences. Same as M_GENERAL for general result types. M_BLOB_INDEX( MIL_INT Index ) Specifies the index of the blob for which to get results. You can get the number of included blobs in the result buffer using M_NUMBER. Parameters Index Specifies the index. 0 &lt;= Value &lt; M_NUMBER Specifies the valid indices of a blob. M_BLOB_LABEL( MIL_INT Label ) Specifies the label of the blob for which to get results. You can get a list of valid blob label values with M_LABEL_VALUE. Parameters Label Specifies the label. M_GENERAL Retrieves a result relating to the entire blob result buffer. M_INCLUDED_BLOBS Retrieves all included blob results. ResultType Specifies the type of result to retrieve. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ResultArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] array of type MIL_FLOAT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_FLOAT&gt; ] array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] array of type MIL_INT16 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT16&gt; ] array of type MIL_INT32 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT32&gt; ] array of type MIL_INT64 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT64&gt; ] MIL_DOUBLE MIL_FLOAT MIL_INT MIL_INT16 MIL_INT32 MIL_INT64 Specifies the address of the array in which to write results.

In this case, you must set LabelOrIndex to M_GENERAL. For retrieving general results from the blob result buffer ResultType Description ResultArrayPtr - Possible values returned M_BLOB_IDENTIFICATION_MODE Retrieves whether features were calculated for each blob, or for groups of blobs treated as single blobs.

M_TRUE Specifies that the maximum number of blobs was reached. M_MAX_LABEL_VALUE Retrieves the maximum label value of all blobs in the result buffer, regardless of included or excluded status. Label values for blobs are generated when a call to MblobCalculate() is made. The maximum label value is not necessarily the same as the total number of blobs because some label values might not be used, depending on the blob's shape. One of the uses for obtaining the maximum label value is to determine if an 8 or 16-bit image buffer is needed for MblobLabel(). Note that if zero is returned, no blobs were found.

Recommended casting type: Array of type MIL_INT M_EXCLUDED Specifies that the blob is not included in calculations and retrieval of results. M_INCLUDED Specifies that the blob is included in calculations and retrieval of results. M_CHAIN_INDEX Retrieves the indices which indicate the chain to which each chained pixel belongs. Each blob's border chain is identified as index 1. Chains that delimit holes in the blob are identified by subsequent indices. When retrieving the chain index of each chained pixel for all included blobs in the image, you can use M_NUMBER_OF_CHAINED_PIXELS to determine the number of chained pixels in each blob, and therefore determine to which blob each chained pixel belongs.

Chained pixels always form a closed chain. This implies that the starting pixel in the chain is also the closing one. If your blob has regions which are 1 pixel wide, these pixels are chained twice, once in the forward direction and then in the opposite direction. The calculation of this feature can be enabled using MblobControl() with M_CHAINS. Blobs with holes have multiple chains.

M_EULER_NUMBER Retrieves the number of blobs minus the number of holes (number of blobs - number of holes). This value is more useful if calculated using the M_WHOLE_IMAGE blob identification mode instead of the M_INDIVIDUAL blob identification mode. Unlike its usual effect, when using the M_WHOLE_IMAGE blob identification mode, each blob is treated individually, as opposed to grouping all of the blobs in an image together. So M_EULER_NUMBER returns (number of blobs - number of holes). Whereas as usual, when using the M_INDIVIDUAL blob identification mode, each blob is treated separately; therefore, the Euler number for each blob is just 1 - the number of holes.

The calculation of this feature can be enabled using MblobControl() with M_FERETS. It is accurate for reasonably compact objects, but becomes less accurate for very elongated objects (because M_FERET_MIN_DIAMETER becomes less accurate). For very elongated objects, M_ELONGATION should be used.

Syntax void MblobLabel( MIL_ID&nbsp;ResultBlobId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function draws a labeled image in which each blob existing in the specified result buffer is represented with its own unique label value. The label values are taken from the blob analysis result buffer. A call to MblobCalculate() must have been made to generate label values for an image. Blobs that have been deleted from the result buffer are not drawn. Parameters Parameters ResultBlobId Specifies the identifier of the blob analysis result buffer. DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination (labeled) image buffer. This must be a single band, 8-, 16-, or 32-bit unsigned buffer. Note, this buffer need not be the same size as the original identifier image used to calculate the blobs; however, it must be 16 or 32 bits deep if the maximum label value is between 256 and 65535 inclusively, or 32 bits if the maximum label value exceeds 65535. To determine the maximum label value, call MblobGetResult() with M_MAX_LABEL_VALUE. The number of blobs alone does not tell you the maximum label value (label values are not necessarily contiguous). This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. ControlFlag Specifies whether or not to clear the destination image buffer before drawing the labeled image into it. This parameter can be set to one of the following: For the destination image buffer Value Description M_CLEAR Clears the destination image buffer before placing the labeled image into it. M_NO_CLEAR Does not clear the destination image buffer before placing the labeled image into it (background pixels will be unchanged).

Syntax void MblobMerge( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcResultBlobId1, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcResultBlobId2, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstResultBlobId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function merges the results of two blob result buffers into a single result buffer. The source results are merged as if they were taken from two vertically adjacent child buffers of one image. As such, the destination result buffer uses the coordinate system of the first result buffer, and positional results from the second result buffer are translated in the Y-direction to take into account this coordinate system change. Border blobs that would touch if they were in one image are grouped into one grouped blob, assigned a single label, and recalculated as if the grouped blobs were one blob. Only features that were calculated for all the individual blobs in the group are recalculated for the new grouped blob; calculations are made using the results of the individual blobs in the group. See the Merging results section of Chapter 6: Blob analysis for more detailed explanations. Note that after merging the results, you can perform an MblobSelect() operation to further include or exclude blobs in your destination result buffer, but if you perform an MblobCalculate() operation after the merge, all the results in the destination result buffer will be discarded. The source blob results must have been calculated by a context that: Has the same run information saving mode (M_SAVE_RUNS set to M_ENABLE or M_DISABLE). Has the same pixel aspect ratio (M_PIXEL_ASPECT_RATIO). Has the same lattice (M_CONNECTIVITY). Has the same blob identification mode (M_BLOB_IDENTIFICATION_MODE). If the blob result buffers have M_BLOB_IDENTIFICATION_MODE set to M_LABELED, they cannot be merged. Has the same number of Ferets (M_NUMBER_OF_FERETS). Note that if the source results include user-specified moments (added using MblobControl() with M_MOMENT_GENERAL), or third-order moments calculated in precise mode (added using MblobControl() with M_MOMENT_THIRD_ORDER set to M_ENABLE, and M_MOMENT_THIRD_ORDER_MODE set to M_PRECISE), MblobMerge() will only be able to merge the moments if they were calculated using their binary definition and M_SAVE_RUNS was enabled. If they were calculated using their grayscale definition or M_SAVE_RUNS was not enabled, the moments will not be merged. Furthermore, if you specify a sorting key for result retrieval, the sorting order will not be respected after the merge. If both source result buffers have the same camera calibration information (although their results might be from different child images), the destination result buffer will have the same camera calibration information. If either of the source result buffers is uncalibrated, or if they have different camera calibration information, the destination result buffer will be uncalibrated. Parameters Parameters SrcResultBlobId1 Specifies the identifier of the first source result buffer. SrcResultBlobId1 and SrcResultBlobId2 cannot be the same. SrcResultBlobId2 Specifies the identifier of the second source result buffer. SrcResultBlobId1 and SrcResultBlobId2 cannot be the same. DstResultBlobId Specifies the identifier of the destination result buffer. DstResultBlobId cannot be the same as SrcResultBlobId1 or SrcResultBlobId2. ControlFlag Specifies the control settings for the merge operation. This parameter can be set to any of the following. For specifying the type of merge operation Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default control operation. The default value is M_COPY, in which the source results are copied into the destination result buffer, and the orientation of the merged result will be as if the source results were taken from two vertically adjacent child buffers of one image. M_COPY Copies the results of SrcResultBlobId1 and SrcResultBlobId2 into the destination result buffer. After the merge, the original results of SrcResultBlobId1 and SrcResultBlobId2 remain intact. M_MOVE Moves the results of the source result buffers into the destination result buffer. After the merge, the original results of SrcResultBlobId1 and SrcResultBlobId2 are emptied.

A seed image is needed to perform an M_RECONSTRUCT_FROM_SEED type of operation. For any other operation type, set this parameter to M_NULL. DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination (processed blobs) image buffer. The destination buffer must be a single band, packed binary, 8- or 16-bit unsigned buffer. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Operation Specifies the type of operation to perform. This parameter can be set to one of the following values: For specifying the type of operation to perform Value Description M_ERASE_BORDER_BLOBS All blobs that do not touch the borders of the source image are copied to the destination image buffer according to the selected processing mode. Pixels of the blobs that touch the border are replaced according to the selected processing mode. Note that when the M_GRAYSCALE and M_FOREGROUND_ZERO processing modes are selected, the border blobs are filled with the average grayscale pixel value of the background. This operation is similar to a \"border kill\". M_EXTRACT_HOLES All holes within the blobs of the source buffer are copied to the destination buffer with their pixel values set to their corresponding blob's pixel values, according to the selected processing mode. A hole cannot touch any image border to be considered a hole. Note that, in the M_GRAYSCALE processing mode, the pixel values of holes copied to the destination buffer are set to the blob's average grayscale pixel value in the source buffer. Also, when the M_GRAYSCALE and M_FOREGROUND_ZERO processing modes are selected, the blobs are filled with the average grayscale pixel value of the background. M_FILL_HOLES All blobs in the source buffer are copied to the destination buffer according to the selected processing mode, and those blobs with holes are filled according to the processing mode. A hole must not touch the border of the image to be considered a hole. Note that when the M_GRAYSCALE processing mode is selected, holes are filled with the average grayscale pixel value of the corresponding blob. M_RECONSTRUCT_FROM_SEED All blobs in the source buffer that have at least one corresponding foreground seed pixel in the seed buffer are copied to the destination buffer, according to the selected processing mode. Blobs that are not seeded are replaced according to the selected processing mode. Note that when the M_GRAYSCALE and M_FOREGROUND_ZERO processing modes are selected, blobs in the source image that are not seeded are filled with the average grayscale value of the background. Also, the value of the seed pixels must be strictly zero for this operation to be performed properly. Note that the seed image and the destination image must have identical dimensions. ProcMode Specifies the processing mode to use. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the processing mode to use Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default processing mode (which corresponds to M_BINARY + M_8_CONNECTED). M_BINARY Specifies that non-zero pixel values will be treated as ones (1) during processing, and the resulting non-zero pixels copied to the destination buffer will be set to the maximum value of that buffer (for example, 0xff for an 8-bit buffer). Note, in general, the M_BINARY processing mode is faster. M_GRAYSCALE Specifies that the values of pixels copied to the destination buffer will be changed to the values of corresponding pixels in the source buffer. Combination values for the values listed in For specifying the processing mode to use. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to set the type of connectivity (lattice). For selecting the type of connectivity Combination value Description M_4_CONNECTED Specifies that blobs are computed on a four connected lattice. M_8_CONNECTED Specifies that blobs are computed on an eight connected lattice. This is the default value. Combination value for the values listed in For specifying the processing mode to use. You can add the following value to the above-mentioned values to set the value of the foreground pixels. For selecting the foreground pixels Combination value Description M_FOREGROUND_ZERO Specifies that the pixel values of blobs will consist of zero values and the pixels of the background will consists of non-zero values; that is, the inverse of the usual blob pixel value definition. Combination value for the values listed in For specifying the processing mode to use. You can add the following value to the above-mentioned values to set whether to accelerate blob reconstruction with seed images. For accelerating blob reconstruction with seed images Combination value Description M_SEED_PIXELS_ALL_IN_BLOBS Optimizes the reconstruction process. Use this value in cases when all seed pixels in the seed buffer have corresponding blob pixels in the source buffer. This condition often exists when the seed buffer is an eroded (see MimErode()) version of the source buffer. Remark The prototypes of functions in the Mblob module changed as of MIL 10 PP2.

Syntax MIL_ID MblobRestore( MIL_CONST_TEXT_PTR&nbsp;FileName, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*ContextBlobIdPtr //out ) Description This function restores a blob analysis context that was previously saved to a file, using MblobSave() or MblobStream(). This function restores all of the blob analysis context's settings that were in effect when it was saved. When the restored blob analysis context is no longer required, release it using MblobFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during allocation; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the blob analysis context's lifetime and you must not manually free it. Parameters Parameters FileName Specifies the name and path of the file from which to restore the blob analysis context. The function handles (internally) the opening and closing of the file. This parameter should be set to the following value: For specifying the file name and path Value Description MIL_TEXT(\"FileName\") 1 Specifies the drive, directory, and name of the file (for example, \"C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). Typically, blob analysis contexts have a MBLOB file extension. To specify a file on a remote computer (under Distributed MIL), prefix the specified file name string with \"remote:///\" (for example, \"remote:///C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). 1 If you are passing the value in a variable, don't enclose it in MIL_TEXT(). SysId Specifies the identifier of the system on which to restore the blob analysis context. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the system identifier Value Description M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. ContextBlobIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the blob analysis context identifier or specifies the data type that the function should use to return the Blob Analysis context identifier. For retrieving the identifier or specifying how to return it Value Description M_NULL Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated blob analysis context ; in this case, a standard MIL identifier of type MIL_ID is returned. M_UNIQUE_ID Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated blob analysis context ; in this case, a MIL smart identifier of type MIL_UNIQUE_BLOB_ID is returned instead of a standard MIL identifier. This setting is only available when using C++11 (or later). A MIL smart identifier manages the lifespan of the MIL object it owns (similar to a std::unique_ptr). Note, you can use a MIL smart identifier as though it were a standard MIL identifier, except that you cannot use it to manually free the blob analysis context (it is freed automatically). For more information, see the MIL smart identifiers subsection of the MIL custom data types, void pointers, extensions, and portability functions section of Chapter 2: Building an application. Address in which to write the identifier Specifies the address of a MIL_ID in which to write the identifier of the restored blob analysis context. If restoration fails, M_NULL is written as the identifier. Return value The returned value is the blob analysis context identifier either as a standard identifier (MIL_ID) or a smart identifier (MIL_UNIQUE_BLOB_ID). If allocation fails, M_NULL is returned (or nullptr if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified). Remark The prototypes of functions in the Mblob module changed as of MIL 10 PP2.

These blobs will be included in or excluded from future operations (calculations or result retrieval), or deleted entirely from the result buffer. Selection criterion can be based on a calculated feature or on the current status of the blobs. MblobCalculate() must have been called at least once before calling this function. If this function is not called at least once, all blobs are included by default. If there is more than one call to this function, the effect of the calls is cumulative unless M_INCLUDE_ONLY or M_EXCLUDE_ONLY is specified as the operation to perform. If a blob is excluded or deleted, its index is reassigned; that is, the index of blobs with indices greater than that of the excluded/deleted blob are reduced by one. This ensures that included blobs have consecutive indices. Label values of included and excluded blobs, however, are left as is; therefore, it is possible to specify the label value of an excluded blob. You can get a list of valid blob label values by calling MblobGetResult() with M_LABEL_VALUE. Deleted blobs' label values are set to 0. Once a blob has been excluded, it can normally be re-included only by specifying M_INCLUDE or M_INCLUDE_ONLY in a future call to this function (with the correct criterion). However, if you change the processing mode of a Blob Analysis context (using MblobControl()), or use the result buffer with different images, the subsequent call to MblobCalculate() will cause all results in the buffer to be discarded and all blobs will be re-included. The limits of the blob selection criterion are set using the CondLow and CondHigh parameters. If the blobs were taken from a calibrated image, these parameters can be set in pixel units or world units. To set the units, use MblobControl() with M_INPUT_SELECT_UNITS. Note that if you set this control type to M_WORLD but you don't pass MblobSelect() a result buffer whose results were obtained from a calibrated target image, the function will generate an error. Parameters Parameters ResultBlobId Specifies the identifier of the blob analysis result buffer to use in the blob selection process. Operation Specifies the operation to perform on the specified blobs. This parameter can be set to one of the following. For specifying the operation to perform Value Description M_DELETE Deletes blobs that meet the specified condition. M_DELETE affects only included blobs, unless otherwise stated by the SelectionCriterion parameter. M_DELETE removes blobs permanently from the result buffer and, consequently, prevents these blobs from being re-included. M_EXCLUDE Excludes all blobs that meet the specified condition. M_EXCLUDE affects only the status of currently included blobs. M_EXCLUDE_ONLY Excludes only those blobs that meet the specified condition and includes all others. The exclusion does not consider the present status of blobs (whether they are excluded), except for blobs that have been deleted (M_DELETE), unless otherwise stated by the SelectionCriterion parameter. M_INCLUDE Includes all blobs that meet the specified condition. M_INCLUDE affects only the status of currently excluded blobs. M_INCLUDE_ONLY Includes only those blobs that meet the specified condition and excludes all others. The inclusion does not consider the present status of blobs (whether they are included), except for blobs that have been deleted (M_DELETE), unless otherwise stated by the SelectionCriterion parameter. M_MERGE Groups all the blobs that meet the specified condition. Once grouped, the blobs are treated as one blob (a grouped blob). The grouped blob is assigned a unique blob label. Only features that were calculated for all the individual blobs in the group are re-calculated for the new grouped blob; calculations are made using the results of the individual blobs in the group. Note that if the source results include user-specified moments (added using MblobControl() with M_MOMENT_GENERAL) or third-order moments calculated in precise mode (added using MblobControl() with M_MOMENT_THIRD_ORDER set to M_ENABLE, and M_MOMENT_THIRD_ORDER_MODE set to M_PRECISE) M_MERGE will only be able to merge the moments if they were calculated using their binary definition and M_SAVE_RUNS was enabled. If they were calculated using their grayscale definition or M_SAVE_RUNS was not enabled, the moments will not be merged. Except when using M_EXCLUDED_BLOBS as the feature for selection, this grouping operation only applies to included blobs. If you are using M_MERGE, you cannot use MblobControl() with M_BLOB_IDENTIFICATION_MODE set to M_LABELED_TOUCHING. SelectionCriterion Specifies the feature to use as part of the selection criterion or the status of the blobs to affect. See MblobControl() for a full description of the features. The specified result buffer must already contain the results for the specified feature. To use as part of the criterion a feature that has only a binary definition, select one of the following.

Combination values for the values listed in For a selection criterion based on a feature that has two different definitions. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to set whether to use the binary or grayscale version of the selected feature. Note that the selected feature must have both a binary definition and a grayscale definition, and both versions must have been calculated. For features with a binary and grayscale definition (both have been calculated) Combination value Description M_BINARY Uses the binary version of the selected feature. M_GRAYSCALE Uses the grayscale version of the selected feature. This is the default value. To use as part of the selection criterion the current status of the blobs, set the SelectionCriterion parameter to one of the following values. For example, you can delete all currently excluded blobs from the list of blobs on which to operate. When the selection criterion is based on the current status of blobs, you must set the Condition, CondLow, and CondHigh parameters to M_NULL. For a selection criterion based on the current status of blobs Value Description M_ALL_BLOBS Uses all blobs. M_EXCLUDED_BLOBS Uses all excluded blobs. M_INCLUDED_BLOBS Uses all included blobs. Condition Specifies the condition for the blob selection. This parameter must be set to one of the values below. When the selection criterion is based on the current status of blobs or M_BLOB_TOUCHING_IMAGE_BORDERS, set the Condition parameter to M_NULL. When the selection criterion is based on a feature (except M_BLOB_TOUCHING_IMAGE_BORDERS), you can specify one of the following conditions that use two limits (CondLow and CondHigh). For blob selection using two limits Value Description M_IN_RANGE Specifies that blobs with values for the specified feature in the range CondLow to CondHigh, inclusive, are included, excluded, or deleted from future operations on the specified result buffer. M_OUT_RANGE Specifies that blobs with values for the specified feature less than CondLow, or greater than CondHigh, are included, excluded, or deleted from future operations on the specified result buffer. When the selection criterion is based on a feature (except M_BLOB_TOUCHING_IMAGE_BORDERS), you can specify one of the following conditions that use only one limit (CondLow). For blob selection using only one limit Value Description M_EQUAL Specifies that blobs with values for the specified feature equal to CondLow are included, excluded, or deleted from future operations on the specified result buffer. M_GREATER Specifies that blobs with values for the specified feature greater than CondLow are included, excluded, or deleted from future operations on the specified result buffer. M_GREATER_OR_EQUAL Specifies that blobs with values for the specified feature greater than or equal to CondLow are included, excluded, or deleted from future operations on the specified result buffer. M_LESS Specifies that blobs with values for the specified feature less than CondLow are included, excluded, or deleted from future operations on the specified result buffer. M_LESS_OR_EQUAL Specifies that blobs with values for the specified feature less than or equal to CondLow are included, excluded, or deleted from future operations on the specified result buffer. M_NOT_EQUAL Specifies that blobs with values for the specified feature not equal to CondLow are included, excluded, or deleted from future operations on the specified result buffer. CondLow Specifies the lower limit of the selected condition. For the lower limit of the selected condition Value Description M_NULL Specifies that this parameter is not applicable. Specify this value when and only when the selection criterion is based on the status of blobs or M_BLOB_TOUCHING_IMAGE_BORDERS. Value Specifies the lower limit of the condition, relative to the input coordinate system specified using MblobControl() with M_INPUT_SELECT_UNITS. CondHigh Specifies the upper limit of the selected condition. For the upper limit of the selected condition Value Description M_NULL Specifies that this parameter is not applicable. Specify this value when: the condition uses only one limit, the selection criterion is based on the status of blobs, or the selection criterion is based on M_BLOB_TOUCHING_IMAGE_BORDERS. Value Specifies the upper limit of the condition, relative to the input coordinate system specified using MblobControl() with M_INPUT_SELECT_UNITS.

Syntax void MblobStream( MIL_TEXT_PTR&nbsp;MemPtrOrFileName, //in-out MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Operation, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;StreamType, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Version, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*ContextBlobIdPtr, //in-out MIL_INT&nbsp;*SizeByteVarPtr //out ) Description This function can load, restore, or save a blob context from/to a file or memory stream. To inquire the number of bytes necessary to save a blob context, you should first call this function (MblobStream()) with M_INQUIRE_SIZE_BYTE. The content saved to memory stream is equivalent to the content saved to file. In addition, any file saved using this function is equivalent to a file saved with MblobSave(). You can use this and other MIL stream functions, for example, to save all required MIL objects, as well as any other custom data, for your application to a memory stream. Once in a memory stream, you can write the stream to a single file or transfer it over a network. You are responsible for concatenating the streams and for saving the stream to file. All information about the previously allocated blob context is saved. All of the blob context's settings that were in effect when the blob context was saved will be restored. Parameters Parameters MemPtrOrFileName Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): MIL_TEXT_PTR [optionally, in C++: a reference to a MIL_STRING] Optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector of type MIL_UINT8 Specifies the file or memory stream. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be returned/specified. SysId Specifies the system on which to restore the blob context. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Operation Specifies the operation to perform. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. StreamType Specifies the type of stream in which to store/from which to restore the blob context. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For the type of stream Value Description M_FILE Specifies a file stream. M_MEMORY Specifies a memory stream. You are responsible for allocating a block of memory for the stream. Version Specifies the MIL version of the blob context. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. ContextBlobIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write or from which to read the identifier of the blob context. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be returned/specified. SizeByteVarPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the size of the blob context, in bytes. If the size is not required, you can set this parameter to M_NULL. The size of the blob context varies depending on the MIL version that you specify.

M_LOAD Loads the content of a specified file or memory stream into a previously allocated blob context. MemPtrOrFileName Specifies the file or memory stream from which to load the context. M_INTERACTIVE [This is only applicable to Windows] Opens a dialog box from which you can interactively specify the drive, directory, and name of the file, when the StreamType parameter is set to M_FILE. MIL_TEXT(\"FileName\") 1 Specifies the drive, directory, and name of the file (for example, \"C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"), when the StreamType parameter is set to M_FILE. Blob contexts typically have a MBLOB file extension. The function handles (internally) the opening and closing of the file. To specify a file on a remote computer (under Distributed MIL), prefix the specified file name string with \"remote:///\" (for example, \"remote:///C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). MemPtr Specifies the address of the block of memory, when the StreamType parameter is set to M_MEMORY. The block of memory should be of type MIL_UINT8. The specified address must correspond to the first memory address in which the object is located, and the block of memory must contain the entire object. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler), you must cast the MIL_UINT8 pointer to a MIL_TEXT_PTR. SysId This parameter must be set to M_NULL. Version This parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. ContextBlobIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable containing the identifier of the blob context. All previous settings are overwritten with those of the loaded context, or are set to the default value if the settings didn't exist in the version of MIL from which the context is being loaded. M_RESTORE Restores a blob context from a file or memory stream and assigns it a MIL identifier. MemPtrOrFileName Specifies the file or memory stream from which to restore the context.

Parameters Parameters SrcResultBlobId Specifies the identifier of the source result buffer. The result buffer must be a valid identifier and the results must be calculated. DstResultBlobId Specifies the identifier of the destination result buffer. DstResultBlobId must be set to the same result buffer as SrcResultBlobId (that is, the transformation is done in-place). Operation Specifies the operation to perform. This parameter can be set to the following value. For specifying the operation Value Description M_RELABEL_CONSECUTIVE Specifies to relabel blobs to get a continuous sequence of labels for included and excluded blobs. New labels are assigned based on the order of the current labels of the blobs, and not their status. For example, if you have 4 blobs, labeled 1,4,5,8, and exclude the second blob, after M_RELABEL_CONSECUTIVE, the blobs will be labeled 1,3,4. Results must have been calculated in M_INDIVIDUAL processing mode. Original blob labeling is not necessarily continuous, and the maximum label value (M_MAX_LABEL_VALUE) can be large.

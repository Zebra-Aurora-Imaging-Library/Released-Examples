      "text": " Matrox Rapixo CL Pro overview Matrox Rapixo CL Pro family of boards consists of the following high-performance PCIe frame grabbers: Matrox Rapixo CL Pro SF, Matrox Rapixo CL Pro DB, Matrox Rapixo CL Pro QB, and Matrox Rapixo CL Pro DF. Matrox Rapixo CL Pro DB supports acquisition from two Camera Link video sources in Base configuration; Matrox Rapixo CL Pro QB supports acquisition from four of these video sources. Matrox Rapixo CL Pro SF supports acquisition from one Camera Link video source in Medium, Full, 72-bit, or 80-bit configuration; Matrox Rapixo CL Pro DF supports two of these sources. Matrox Rapixo CL Pro supports area-scan and line-scan monochrome and color video sources. The color video sources can be RGB video sources or video sources with a Bayer color filter. Matrox Rapixo CL Pro can decode Bayer color-encoded images and perform color space conversions while transferring the image to the Host. Besides standard Camera Link video sources, Matrox Rapixo CL Pro also supports additional types of video sources, including some time-multiplexed video sources. As a Matrox Rapixo CL Pro grabs images, it can vertically or horizontally flip them. In addition, Matrox Rapixo CL Pro can perform color-space conversions, Bayer decoding, and image subsampling.

      "text": " Using Matrox Rapixo CL Pro with MIL To use Matrox Rapixo CL Pro, you must allocate it using MsysAlloc() with M_SYSTEM_RAPIXOCL. This allocation opens communication with the Matrox Rapixo CL Pro board and allows MIL to use its resources. You can allocate a MIL Rapixo CL Pro system for your board in multiple processes (executables). However, different processes cannot allocate a digitizer for the same acquisition paths. Matrox Rapixo CL Pro features four quadrature decoders that can decode input from rotary or linear encoders with quadrature output. For more information on this feature, refer to the Using quadrature input from a rotary encoder section of Chapter 56: I/O signals and communicating with external devices. This chapter also provides information on how to configure and use the I/O signals. Camera Link video sources, attached to Matrox Rapixo CL Pro, can use a GenICam interface. For information regarding using MIL to access the GenICam SFNC-compatible features of your camera, see the Using MIL with GenICam section of Chapter 27: Grabbing with your digitizer. For information regarding the use of your Matrox Rapixo CL Pro's Processing FPGA, see Chapter 66: Using MIL with a Processing FPGA. Performing Bayer color conversion in hardware When Matrox Rapixo CL Pro grabs color images from a video source with a Bayer color filter (as specified by the DCF), it performs Bayer color conversion in hardware, as it transfers the images to the Host. If the images require white balancing, Matrox Rapixo CL Pro can perform this automatically if white balancing is enabled using MdigControl() with M_WHITE_BALANCE set to M_ENABLE. If performing white balancing, you can use the default white balance coefficients, automatically have them calculated (using MdigControl() with M_WHITE_BALANCE set to M_CALCULATE), or set explicit coefficients (M_BAYER_COEFFICIENTS_ID). For information on Bayer color conversion, refer to the Using images acquired with a Bayer color filter section of Chapter 23: Data buffers. If you don't want to perform Bayer color conversion in hardware, disable it using MdigControl() with M_BAYER_CONVERSION set to M_DISABLE. The M_BAYER... control types of MdigControl() can only be used when grabbing from a camera that has a Bayer color filter (as specified by the DCF); otherwise, an error will be generated. Using frame burst with a multi-frame buffer Matrox Rapixo CL Pro supports frame burst technology. This technology allows you to grab a group of sequential frames into a multi-frame buffer with one grab command (MdigGrab(), or one grab of MdigProcess()); the defined number of frames are stored contiguously in the same buffer. The end-of-grab event only occurs once the entire group of frames has been grabbed, reducing the number of events that need to be handled. This is useful in cases where you have a high frame rate and need to ensure that no frames are missed. Note that a user-defined function hooked to the end-of-grab event (MdigProcess(), or MdigHookFunction() with M_GRAB_END) is executed only once the entire group of frames has been grabbed. For information on creating a multi-frame image buffer to store sequential frames, see the Specifying the dimensions of a multi-frame image buffer subsection of the Specifying the dimensions of a data buffer section of Chapter 23: Data buffers.

Independent digitizers have different device numbers and use different acquisition paths. The following is the number of available acquisition paths on each version of the board and the device number to use to allocate a path for the digitizer when calling MdigAlloc(). Matrox Rapixo CL Pro DB has two acquisition paths (M_DEV0 and M_DEV1). Matrox Rapixo CL Pro QB has four acquisition paths (M_DEV0 to M_DEV3).

      "text": " Minimum latency and grabbing all frames When grabbing with either MdigGrab() or MdigProcess(), Matrox Rapixo CL Pro is optimized to have the smallest latency possible between the last pixel sent from the camera to the last pixel written into the buffer. This allows the buffer to be available for processing with a minimum amount of delay. On-board memory is used to protect against PCIe latency. By default, Matrox Rapixo CL Pro grabs into off-board buffers. To perform real-time grabs, your rate of acquisition (grabbing bandwidth) must be lower than the PCIe maximum transfer rate (PCIe bandwidth). If the acquisition rate is higher than the transfer rate across the PCIe bus, frames will be skipped rather than allowing a grab over-run to occur. To determine the image transfer speed from Matrox Rapixo CL Pro to the Host, use the Matrox Rapixo CL Pro Bench utility. Detecting missed frames when using MdigProcess To be certain that no frames were missed when MdigProcess() was last used, use MdigInquire() with M_PROCESS_FRAME_MISSED. This value is based on a comparison between the frame rate (M_PROCESS_FRAME_RATE) and the frame count (M_PROCESS_FRAME_COUNT). If a grab is triggered from a temperamental trigger or if the hooked function is slow, the value returned by M_PROCESS_FRAME_MISSED will be affected. This value is most trustworthy with a camera in continuous mode. You can inquire the frame time-stamp sampled at the end of the frame using MdigGetHookInfo() with M_TIME_STAMP. Use M_PROCESS_FRAME_COUNT to determine the total number of frames grabbed in the sequence. Use M_PROCESS_FRAME_RATE to return an estimate of the frame rate in frames per second. Note that this value is determined based on the average of the camera's frame rate, and the total amount of time to process the user-defined hooked function(s). Quickly copying an on-board buffer to a Host destination buffer When copying an on-board buffer into a Host destination buffer, the copy operation should be performed by your Matrox Rapixo CL Pro using the Matrox Rapixo CL Pro's DMA engine, rather than the Host. Your Matrox Rapixo CL Pro will perform the operation faster than the Host. To ensure that Matrox Rapixo CL Pro performs the operation, use the following: To copy an on-board buffer into a destination buffer on the Host, use MbufCopy(). To resize an on-board buffer while copying it to a destination buffer on the Host, use MimResize() with a factor of 1 to 16 and with an interpolation mode of M_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR. Alternatively, you can use MbufTransfer() to perform the same operation. To flip an on-board buffer while copying it to a destination buffer on the Host, use MimFlip(). Note that for your Matrox Rapixo CL Pro to perform these operations, the destination Host buffer must be allocated in non-paged memory (that is, using MbufAlloc...() with + M_IMAGE + M_NON_PAGED). Quickly converting buffer formats while copying When copying an on-board buffer into a destination Host buffer, the color space converter and image formatter can automatically convert the bit-depth and color format of the source buffer to the bit-depth and color format of the destination buffer. For on-board conversion of buffers to take place, the following on-board image and destination depth and color formats are supported. On-board buffer depth and color format (specified in the DCF). Host destination buffer depth and color format. 8-bit monochrome. 16-bit monochrome. M_PACKED + M_BGR24. M_PACKED + M_BGR32. M_YUV16_YUYV / M_YUV16. M_PLANAR + M_RGB24.

      "text": " Using Matrox Rapixo CL Pro data latches Matrox Rapixo CL Pro uses data latches to store signal state information, the rotary decoder counter value, or a timestamp at a specific point during a grab. The data latch is reset at every end of grabbed frame event. A data latch does not suffer the delays typical to hooking a hook-handler function to these specific points during the grab and inquiring and storing related information using software. You can specify the data latch trigger source and the data to record upon the trigger using MdigControl() with the M_DATA_LATCH... control types. To retrieve data from a data latch, use MdigGetHookInfo() with M_DATA_LATCH.... Note that you can only use data latches in association with the MIL digitizer allocated using MdigAlloc() with M_DEV0 or M_DEV1. Steps to configure and retrieve data from a data latch The following steps provide a basic methodology for configuring and retrieving data from a data latch: Specify what triggers storing the specified information to the specified data latch, using MdigControl() with M_DATA_LATCH_TRIGGER_SOURCE + M_LATCHn. The trigger can be a specific auxiliary signal, a rotary decoder's counter value, a timer active event, or one of a limited number of grab events (such as a start of frame event). If necessary, specify the trigger signal transition upon which to store the information, using M_DATA_LATCH_TRIGGER_ACTIVATION + M_LATCHn. Note that this is only useful when M_DATA_LATCH_TRIGGER_SOURCE is set to M_AUX_IOn or M_TIMER_ACTIVE. Specify the type of information to store, using M_DATA_LATCH_TYPE. Note that each type of information can only be associated with one data latch, except for timestamp, which can be associated with up to four data latches. MIL returns an error when this limitation is not respected. To latch data before the start of the first grabbed frame, set M_DATA_LATCH_MODE to M_PREFETCH. Otherwise, if the data latch is triggered before the start of the first grabbed frame, no information is stored. To latch data only once the grab has started (that is, as of the start of the first grabbed frame), set M_DATA_LATCH_MODE to M_DEFAULT; this is the default value. Enable the data latch using M_DATA_LATCH_STATE set to M_ENABLE. If necessary, repeat steps 1 to 5 for each data latch used. Perform the grab. You can use MdigProcess() to grab an image; in the hook-handler function, retrieve and make use of the information stored in the data latch, using MdigGetHookInfo(). Alternatively, hook an end of grab frame event (M_GRAB_FRAME_END) to a hook-handler function using MdigHookFunction() and call MdigGrab() to grab an image; then, to retrieve and make use of the information stored in the data latch, call MdigGetHookInfo(). When done, disable the data latches using MdigControl() with M_DATA_LATCH_STATE set to M_DISABLE. Triggering the data latch Data latches can store data at several different points during a grab. Below are a few events that can trigger a data latch. Callout # MdigControl() with M_DATA_LATCH_TRIGGER_SOURCE MdigControl() with M_DATA_LATCH_TRIGGER_ACTIVATION 1, 4, and 8 M_AUX_IOn M_EDGE_RISING 2, 5, and 9 M_TIMER_ACTIVE M_EDGE_RISING or M_EDGE_FALLING 3 and 7 M_GRAB_FRAME_START 6 and 10 M_GRAB_FRAME_END Events that occur before the start of the first grabbed frame of queued grabs or a grab sequence (such as, any auxiliary I/O change event, rotary decoder position change, or timer active event between when the grab command is queued until the start of the first grabbed frame) can only trigger a data latch if the data latch has its mode set to prefetch (using MdigControl() with M_DATA_LATCH_MODE set to M_PREFETCH). In the above image, if the data latch mode is set to prefetch (using M_DATA_LATCH_MODE to M_PREFETCH), reading the data latch at the end of frame 1 could return the information latched at captions 1 through 6, depending on which event triggers the data latch. However, if the data latch mode is set to default (M_DATA_LATCH_MODE to M_DEFAULT), reading the data latch at the end of frame 1 could only return captions 3 through 6. In both cases, reading the data latch at the end of frame 2 could return captions 7 though 10. Captions 5 and 6 are returned at the end of frame 1, even though they relate to frame 2 because the data of all enabled data latches is returned at the end of every grabbed frame end event (that is, at the end of each grabbed frame). If calls to MdigGrab() occur while no other grab is currently being performed and M_DATA_LATCH_MODE is set to M_PREFETCH, events that occur from the moment the grab command is issued until the start of the grabbed frame can also trigger a data latch and be retrieved at the end of the grabbed frame, for each MdigGrab() call. Callout # MdigControl() with M_DATA_LATCH_TRIGGER_SOURCE MdigControl() with M_DATA_LATCH_TRIGGER_ACTIVATION A and F M_AUX_IOn M_EDGE_RISING B and G M_TIMER_ACTIVE M_EDGE_RISING or M_EDGE_FALLING C and H M_GRAB_FRAME_START D and I M_GRAB_FRAME_END E No data can be latched during this period In the above image, if the data latch mode is set to M_PREFETCH, reading the data latch at the end of frame 1 could return the information latched at captions A through D, depending on which event triggers the data latch. In this example, no data latch can return information relating to events during caption E. Frame 2 could return the information latched at captions F through I. Note that, when using MdigProcess or when queuing grabs using MdigGrab in asynchronous mode, there is no dead zone. Data latch limitations To set the type of data that a data latch should store, use M_DATA_LATCH_TYPE. In most cases, you can set up only one data latch to record a specific type of data (for example, only one data latch can store the status of all I/O signals). The exceptions to this are data latches that store timestamps; you can set up four data latches to store timestamps. MIL returns an error when this limitation is not respected. Retrieving data latch information MIL allows each data latch to store multiple instances of data. For example, when latching the timestamp at the end of each grabbed line of a frame with 1024 lines, to retrieve the 1024th timestamp, use MdigGetHookInfo() with M_DATA_LATCH_VALUE + M_LATCHn + M_VALUE_INDEX(1023), where n is the number associated with the data latch. To retrieve all the stored information associated with a specific data latch, use M_DATA_LATCH_VALUE_ALL + M_LATCHn. Using our previous example, this would return 1024 timestamps. To inquire how many pieces of information are stored inside a data latch, use M_DATA_LATCH_VALUE_COUNT. To convert a timestamp from clock ticks to seconds, use the following equation: Timestamp * ( TimestampFrequencyInHz). To inquire the clock frequency, use MdigInquire() with M_DATA_LATCH_CLOCK_FREQUENCY.

      "text": " Matrox Rapixo CL Pro SF/DF connectors and signal names This section serves as a reference to match Matrox Rapixo CL Pro SF and Pro CL DF's connectors and auxiliary signals with MIL information, such as MIL auxiliary/camera control signal numbers. To set/inquire all the settings for this board's auxiliary signals (for example, signal routing and timer settings), use MdigControl() / MdigInquire(), respectively. Matrox Rapixo CL Pro family members have a different number of acquisition paths and auxiliary/camera control signals. For each Matrox Rapixo CL Pro family member, only the auxiliary/camera control signals associated with the following digitizer device numbers are supported: Matrox Rapixo CL Pro type Digitizer device # Matrox Rapixo CL Pro SF M_DEV0. Matrox Rapixo CL Pro DF M_DEV0, M_DEV1. The following table lists the connectors of the auxiliary/control signals that can be used for each digitizer device number: Digitizer device # Matrox Rapixo CL Pro SF Matrox Rapixo CL Pro DF M_DEV0 Auxiliary I/O connector A and C Auxiliary I/O connector A and C M_DEV1 Auxiliary I/O connector B and D Auxiliary I/O signals can have one or more functionalities (for example, trigger input, timer output, or user output, depending on the signal). Their possible functionalities are described in their description in the pinout table below. Note that, unlike some other Matrox frame grabbers, there is no limit to the number of events that can be triggered simultaneously using the auxiliary input signals, nor is there a restriction on which auxiliary signal can be used to trigger the event. Only those auxiliary signals that have matching MIL information are included in this section. For information on internal connectors and a comprehensive list of all available input and output signals, refer to the board's installation and hardware reference manual. Board connectors The Matrox Rapixo CL Pro SF and Pro CL DF boards and cable adapter brackets provide several interface connectors. On the bracket of Matrox Rapixo CL Pro SF, there are two Camera Link video input connectors and an auxiliary I/O connector. On the double bracket of Matrox Rapixo CL Pro DF, there are two pairs of Camera Link video input connectors and two auxiliary I/O connectors. On the cable adapter bracket, there are two external auxiliary I/O connectors. Only the following connectors have auxiliary signals with matching MIL information. Connector Name Connector Abbreviation Image Description Camera Link video input connectors SDR (0, 1, 2, and 3) The Camera Link video input connectors are 26-pin high-density female mini Camera Link connectors. They are used to receive video input, timing, synchronization signals and transmit/receive communication signals between the video source and the frame grabber. There are two Camera Link video input connectors (SDR 0 and 1) on Matrox Rapixo CL Pro SF. There are four Camera Link video input connectors (SDR 0, 1, 2 and 3) on Matrox Rapixo CL Pro DF. External auxiliary I/O connector HD-15 1 (A, B, C, and D) The external auxiliary I/O connectors are high-density D-subminiature 15-pin male connectors. They are used to transmit/receive auxiliary signals. External auxiliary I/O connectors A and (if present) B are located on Matrox Rapixo CL Pro, and external auxiliary I/O connectors C and D are located on the cable adapter bracket. 1 Previously referred to as DBHD-15, but more accurately known as DE-15.

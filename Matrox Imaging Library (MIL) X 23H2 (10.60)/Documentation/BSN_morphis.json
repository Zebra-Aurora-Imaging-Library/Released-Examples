      "text": " Matrox Morphis overview The Matrox Morphis family consists of three imaging boards capable of acquiring standard, monochrome/color, analog video: Matrox Morphis Dual, Matrox Morphis Quad, and Matrox Morphis QxT. Matrox Morphis Dual can be purchased with an acquisition section. There are four factory-configured versions of Matrox Morphis Dual: Matrox Morphis Dual Standard, Matrox Morphis eDual Standard, Matrox Morphis Dual High Density Connector (HDC), and Matrox Morphis Dual PC/104-Plus. Matrox Morphis Quad can be purchased solely as a frame grabber. There are two factory configured versions of Matrox Morphis Quad: a PCI-X version and a PCIe version. The PCIe version has the same features as the PCI-X version except that it connects to the Host via a x1 PCIe bus. Common features The Matrox Morphis family of frame grabbers can simultaneously capture from multiple cameras using independent acquisition paths. In addition, Matrox Morphis can switch the capture (channel switch) between cameras of the same type. The Matrox Morphis family of frame grabbers can perform ultra-fast switching when they are not grabbing from several acquisition paths simultaneously. The Matrox Morphis family of video decoders can accept composite (CVBS) and component (Y/C) video in NTSC/PAL formats, and monochrome video in RS-170/CCIR, both of which have square pixels. Grabbed data can be converted into the following formats: RGB planar, BGR32 packed, YUV16 packed (stored in YUYV format), and 8-bit monochrome. Formatting features of Matrox Morphis include cropping (ROI capture), subsampling to 1/16th of a field or frame, and vertical/horizontal flipping. Matrox Morphis Dual Matrox Morphis Dual Standard can simultaneously capture from any two connected, supported, asynchronous video sources, using its two independent acquisition paths. On the bracket of its base board, you can connect up to 4 cameras. Matrox Morphis eDual Standard provides the same features as Matrox Morphis Dual Standard except that it connects to the Host via a x1 PCIe slot. Therefore, when this manual refers to both versions of the Standard, it will refer to them as Matrox Morphis eDual/Dual Standard. Matrox Morphis Dual HDC provides the same features as Matrox Morphis eDual/Dual Standard, except the HDC version has a high density 44-pin video input connector on its bracket to directly support connection with up to 16 CVBS/monochrome or 8 Y/C video sources, or a combination of both. Matrox Morphis Quad Matrox Morphis Quad is a frame grabber that can simultaneously capture from any four connected, supported, asynchronous video sources, using its four independent acquisition paths. If not simultaneously capturing from four video sources, Matrox Morphis Quad can perform ultra-fast switching. Note that Matrox Morphis Quad does not support triggered grabs (MdigControl() with the M_GRAB_TRIGGER...). Matrox Morphis Video and I/O Input modules There are two modules available for Matrox Morphis: the Video and I/O Input module and the Video Input module. You can connect the Matrox Morphis Video and I/O Input module to the Matrox Morphis eDual/Dual Standard, Dual HDC, and Quad. You can connect the Matrox Morphis Video Input module only to the Matrox Morphis eDual/Dual Standard and Quad. Note that you can only connect a single Matrox Morphis Video and I/O module to the base board, and that Matrox Morphis Video and I/O module and the Matrox Morphis Video Input module are mutually exclusive. Using optional expansion modules with a Matrox Morphis eDual/Dual Standard or Quad, you can extend the number of video sources that can be connected. You can use up to three Matrox Morphis Video Input modules and to each module, connect the same number of video sources as is supported by the base board. Alternatively, you can use a single expansion module, the Matrox Morphis Video and I/O module, and connect an additional 12 CVBS/monochrome or 6 Y/C video sources, or a combination of both. Summary of Matrox Morphis features The following table outlines the features currently available for each member of the Matrox Morphis family of frame grabbers.

      "text": " Cameras that can be connected to Matrox Morphis The following types of camera can be connected to Matrox Morphis. Type of camera Morphis eDual/Dual Standard Morphis Dual HDC Morphis Quad Composite color/monochrome 4/12 1 16 4/16 1 Y/C 2/6 1 8 2/8 1 1 Available with either 3 Matrox Morphis Video Input modules or a single Matrox Morphis Video and I/O module. You can allocate up to 2 independent digitizers on Matrox Morphis eDual/Dual Standard and Dual HDC, or up to 4 independent digitizers on Matrox Morphis Quad, with MdigAlloc(). The number of data channels available on each board depends on its configuration. For more information, refer to the Matrox Morphis Installation and Hardware Reference manual. You can switch the grab between cameras of the same type using MdigControl() with M_CHANNEL. Data input channels of acquisition paths For Matrox Morphis eDual/Dual standard and Quad, all acquisition paths have several multiplexed data input channels. This means that they have several data input channels but can only grab from one channel at a time. In this case, the MIL digitizer representing the acquisition path(s) has multiple data input channels. If you have a camera that is connected to a channel other than the first of its acquisition path, you must specify the channel, using MdigControl() with M_CHANNEL. Switching between cameras of the same type When connecting several cameras of the same data format to different data input channels of an acquisition path, allocate a single digitizer with the appropriate DCF for the first camera and use MdigControl() with M_CHANNEL to switch between the others of the same type. Switching between cameras of different types When connecting cameras of different data formats to different data input channels of a digitizer, you must use a different DCF for each camera. You could allocate a digitizer, grab the required frame, free the digitizer, and then allocate the digitizer again with the second DCF; this can increase the time required for the operation. MIL can circumvent this problem by using a fast DCF-switching technique which is outlined in the steps below: Make as many calls to MdigAlloc() as you have cameras, with different formats, from which you want to grab. Specify the required digitizer settings using MdigControl() and MdigHookFunction() for each allocated digitizer. Specify the channel to use for the grab using M_CHANNEL. Call MdigGrab() with an allocated digitizer identifier. Note that if this call uses a digitizer identifier different from the previous call, a DCF switch will occur. If there is a grab in progress with one digitizer, calling any of the following functions with any other digitizer will result in an error: MdigGrab(), MdigGrabContinuous(), MdigInquire(), MdigProcess(), MdigAlloc(), and MdigFree(). To synchronize your grabs with different digitizers, use MthrWait(). Channel locking and unlocking If the synchronization between your frame grabber and a camera is uncertain, enable MdigControl() with M_CAMERA_LOCK to lock the digitizer to the synchronization signal of the camera after a channel-switch. This provides additional stability. In this case, the digitizer is unlocked from the first camera and then locked to the next camera after a channel-switch occurs. Typically, MIL finds the best balance between the fastest lock and the most reliable lock possible, depending on your camera. You can control channel locking sensitivity using MdigControl() with M_CAMERA_LOCK_SENSITIVITY and M_CAMERA_UNLOCK_SENSITIVITY. Note that the speed and reliability of a camera lock directly affects the subsequent unlock and vice versa (for example, a fast lock might create an unreliable unlock, or a reliable lock might cause a slow unlock). Grabbing a single field With interlaced scanning cameras, 2 fields are grabbed by default; therefore one call to MdigGrab() will grab both the odd and even fields. You can change the number of fields to 1 and have MIL treat each field as one frame using MdigControl() with M_GRAB_FIELD_NUM, grabbing every second row and storing them in sequential rows. Therefore, the grab time is reduced by half. This control type can only be set to 1 or 2, and should only be used for interlaced video. When set to 1, each field is treated like a frame and the following digitizer events occur relative to the grabbed field: M_GRAB_FRAME_START, M_GRAB_END, and M_GRAB_FRAME_END. To achieve 60 fps in NTSC or 50 fps in PAL, the control type M_GRAB_START_MODE must be set to M_FIELD_START.

      "text": " Matrox Morphis Watchdog functionality The Watchdog allows your MIL application to automatically recover from either application failure or some other type of critical situation. The Watchdog can automatically reboot your computer when, for some reason, your computer hangs for longer than a predetermined amount of time. In addition, the Watchdog permits a user-defined function to be attached (hooked) to a Watchdog warning. The Watchdog warning occurs when the Watchdog warning timer expires. This allows you to have two ways to recover (or at least be warned) from instabilities in your application. Configuring the Watchdog To configure the Watchdog, perform the following: Install the appropriate cables as described in the Matrox Morphis Installation and Hardware reference manual. Set the time that the Watchdog should wait before rebooting; use MsysControl() with M_WATCHDOG_REBOOT_TIMEOUT. Set the time that the Watchdog warning should wait before performing the specified hooked function; use MsysControl() with M_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT. Note that if the Watchdog timeout is disabled, the warning timer will be ignored, and a Watchdog reboot timeout will trigger the reboot. To hook a function to handle the Watchdog event (which occurs when the warning timer expires), use MsysHookFunction() with M_WATCHDOG_WARNING. Enable the Watchdog, using MsysControl() with M_WATCHDOG_MODE set to M_ENABLE. Inside a processing loop, reset the Watchdog reboot timer and the Watchdog warning timer, using MsysControl() with M_WATCHDOG_RESET. The Watchdog also keeps a count of the number of times your computer reboots. Inquire the count using MsysInquire() with M_WATCHDOG_RESET_COUNTER. To reset the counter, use MsysControl() with M_WATCHDOG_RESET_COUNTER. The Watchdog will force a reboot if your computer hangs while rebooting or if the reboot process does not complete within a certain amount of time. Example The following example shows how to configure and use the Watchdog. Note that exactly where you call the Watchdog within your application is highly situational. /* Initialize the Watchdog by setting the required timeout values. */ MsysControl(MilSystem, M_WATCHDOG_REBOOT_TIMEOUT, 120 * 1000); // 2 min. MsysControl(MilSystem, M_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT, 30 * 1000); // 30 sec. /* Enable the Watchdog */ MsysControl(MilSystem, M_WATCHDOG_MODE, M_ENABLE); /* While in a processing loop, somewhere in your application, you must send the command to reset the watchdog timer. */ while(ProcessingLoop) { /* Place your application's processing loop here */ /* Reset the Watchdog's timer.*/ MsysControl(MilSystem, M_WATCHDOG_RESET, M_DEFAULT); } /* End the processing loop */ Matrox Morphis Watchdog functionality Configuring the Watchdog Example ",

      "text": " Matrox Morphis connectors and signal names This section serves as a reference to match Matrox Morphis connectors and auxiliary signals with MIL information, such as MIL auxiliary signal numbers. Matrox Morphis Dual and Quad have a different number of acquisition paths and auxiliary signals. For each Matrox Morphis, only the auxiliary signals associated with the following digitizer device numbers are supported: Matrox Morphis type Digitizer device number Matrox Morphis Dual/eDual M_DEV0, M_DEV1 Matrox Morphis Quad/eQuad M_DEV0, M_DEV1, M_DEV2, M_DEV3 The following table lists the connectors of the auxiliary signals that can be used for each digitizer device number: Digitizer device # Matrox Morphis Dual/eDual Matrox Morphis Quad/eQuad M_DEV0 DBHD-44 (VIOM, P104, or HDC) and one shared between BNC (1), DB-9, HDC, and P104. DBHD-44 (VIOM) M_DEV1 DBHD-44 (VIOM, P104, or HDC) and one shared between BNC (0), DB-9, HDC, and P104. DBHD-44 (VIOM) M_DEV2 DBHD-44 (VIOM) M_DEV3 DBHD-44 (VIOM) Auxiliary I/O signals can have one or more functionalities (for example, trigger input, user input or user output, depending on the signal). Their possible functionalities are described in their description in the pinout table below. Shared input and output signals can be accessed by the digitizers with the specified M_DEVn number. Although a shared signal can be accessed by multiple digitizers, all the functionalities supported by the signal might not be accessible by all these digitizers. In the case of shared output signals, ensure that only one digitizer is driving the output. To set/inquire the routing, mode, or state of an auxiliary signal, use MsysControl() / MsysInquire() with M_IO_... control/inquire types, respectively. Whereas, the MIL function that you should use to act upon an input signal or setup the source of an output signal depends on the functionality. For example, you can use MsysControl() with M_USER_BIT_... control types, MdigControl() with M_GRAB_TRIGGER_... control types, or MdigControl() with M_TIMER_... control types, and you can use their corresponding MsysInquire() and MdigInquire() inquire types to inquire them. Note that, when using MsysControl() / MsysInquire(), a system with any device number can be used; whereas, when using MdigControl() / MdigInquire(), use a digitizer with the digitizer device number as specified in the pinout table below. Only those auxiliary signals that have matching MIL information are included in this section. For information on internal connectors and a comprehensive list of all available input and output signals, refer to the board's installation and hardware reference manual.

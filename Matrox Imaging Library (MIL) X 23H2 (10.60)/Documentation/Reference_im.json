Syntax MIL_ID MimAllocResult( MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;NbEntries, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ResultType, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*ResultImIdPtr //out ) Description This function allocates a result buffer with the specified number of entries, for use with some of the Image Processing module's functions (for example, the statistical functions). When the image processing result buffer is no longer required, release it using MimFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during allocation; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the image processing result buffer's lifetime and you must not manually free it. Parameters Parameters SysId Specifies the system on which to allocate the result buffer. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the system identifier Value Description M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). NbEntries Specifies the number of buffer entries to allocate for the specified result buffer. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the number of buffer entries Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that MIL automatically establishes the size of the result buffer. You can only use this value when the ResultType parameter is set to M_AUGMENTATION_RESULT, M_COUNT_LIST, M_LOCATE_PEAK_1D_RESULT, M_STATISTICS_RESULT, or M_WAVELET_TRANSFORM_RESULT. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the number of buffer entries. This value should take into account the type of result buffer being allocated. A specific number of entries must be specified when the ResultType parameter is set to M_EVENT_LIST, M_EXTREME_LIST, M_FIND_ORIENTATION_LIST, M_HIST_LIST, or M_PROJ_LIST. A specific number of entries cannot be specified when the ResultType parameter is set to M_COUNT_LIST, M_LOCATE_PEAK_1D_RESULT, M_STATISTICS_RESULT, or M_WAVELET_TRANSFORM_RESULT. ResultType Specifies the type of data that will be stored in this result buffer.

You can add the following value to the above-mentioned values to set the type of data stored in the result buffer. For M_PROJ_LIST, M_EXTREME_LIST, or M_EVENT_LIST to change the type of data to store Combination value Description M_FLOAT Allocates a result buffer of type float. You should allocate a float result type buffer when the source buffer specified by MimProjection(), MimFindExtreme(), or MimLocateEvent() is of type float. If the specified source buffer is of type float and the result buffer is not, the functions can produce inaccurate results. Note that allocating a result buffer of type float when the source buffer is not, will slow down the operations performed by the MimProjection(), MimFindExtreme(), or MimLocateEvent() function. ResultImIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the image processing result buffer identifier or specifies the data type that the function should use to return the image processing result buffer identifier. For retrieving the identifier or specifying how to return it Value Description M_NULL Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated image processing result buffer ; in this case, a standard MIL identifier of type MIL_ID is returned. M_UNIQUE_ID Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated image processing result buffer ; in this case, a MIL smart identifier of type MIL_UNIQUE_IM_ID is returned instead of a standard MIL identifier.

Syntax void MimArith( MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Src1ImageBufIdOrConst, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Src2ImageBufIdOrConst, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Operation //in ) Description This function performs the specified point-to-point operation on two images, an image and a constant, an image, or a constant, storing results in the specified destination image buffer. You can limit this function's results to a region of an image buffer using a region of interest (ROI) set using MbufSetRegion(). The ROI must be defined in raster format (M_RASTER or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error is generated if the ROI is only in vector format (M_VECTOR). If you specify multiple image buffers with an ROI, results are limited to the portion of the ROIs that intersect. Parameters Parameters Src1ImageBufIdOrConst Specifies the data source of the first operand. This parameter can be given an image buffer identifier or a constant. When using a constant, it will be considered to have the same type as the destination buffer unless M_FLOAT_PROC or M_FIXED_POINT has been added to the operation type. If you specify an image buffer that has an ROI associated with it, the ROI must be in raster format; otherwise, you will get an error. Note that when the destination buffer is unsigned and Src1ImageBufIdOrConst refers to a constant, it will be considered unsigned as well. In this case, you should not use a negative value for Src1ImageBufIdOrConst, since it might cause unexpected results. Note that logical operations (for example M_AND and M_OR) cannot be performed on a floating-point buffer. Src2ImageBufIdOrConst Specifies the data source of the second operand. This parameter can be given an image buffer identifier or a constant. If the selected operation uses only one operand, set this parameter to M_NULL. When using a constant, it will be considered to have the same type as the destination buffer unless M_FLOAT_PROC or M_FIXED_POINT has been added to the operation type. If you specify an image buffer that has an ROI associated with it, the ROI must be in raster format; otherwise, you will get an error. Note that when the destination buffer is unsigned and Src2ImageBufIdOrConst refers to a constant, it will be considered unsigned as well. In this case, you should not use a negative value for Src2ImageBufIdOrConst, since it might cause unexpected results. Note that logical operations (for example M_AND and M_OR) cannot be performed on a floating-point buffer. DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination of the results. This parameter must be given an image buffer identifier. If you specify an image buffer that has an ROI associated with it, the ROI must be in raster format; otherwise, you will get an error. Operation Specifies the operation to perform. This parameter should be set in accordance to the operands. Operations using two image buffer operands are the following: For specifying the type of operation Value Description M_ABS_SUB Subtracts the absolute values of the second image from the corresponding absolute values of the first image. M_ADD Adds the values of the first image to the corresponding values of the second image. M_AND Performs a bitwise AND operation between the values of the first and second images. M_ATAN2 Performs the two-argument arctangent function, atan2(x, y), using the first image for the X-coordinates and the second image for the Y-coordinates. This results in the counter-clockwise angle between the positive X-axis and each X- and Y-coordinate. Note that M_ATAN2 uses the standard mathematical convention, where the Y-axis is oriented upwards. If you want to use the MIL angle convention, negate the Y-coordinate buffer using MimArith() with M_NEG before you use this operation. MIL establishes the resulting angle according to the type of the source image buffer, and its minimum and maximum values. For unsigned buffers, MIL maps 0° to the minimum value of the two images, and 360° to the maximum value plus 1 (for 8-bit buffers, a maximum possible value of 256 maps to 360°). For signed buffers, MIL maps -180° to the minimum value of the two images, and +180° to the maximum value plus 1. For float buffers, MIL expects values between 0 and 1, and maps them to angles between 0° and 360°. M_AVG Averages the values of the first and second images. M_DIV Divides the values of the first image by the values of the second image. Note that dividing a value by 0 will generate a destination pixel with an unpredictable value. This will not generate an error. M_EXP Raises the values of the first image to the power of the second image's values. M_LOG Takes the logarithm of the values of the second image, to the base of the values of the first image. M_MAX Compares the values of the first image with the values of the second image, and takes the maximum of the two. M_MAX_ABS Compares the absolute values of the first image with the absolute values of the second image, and takes the maximum of the two. M_MIN Compares the values of the first image with the values of the second image, and takes the minimum of the two. M_MIN_ABS Compares the absolute values of the first image with the absolute values of the second image, and takes the minimum of the two. M_MULT Multiplies the values of the first image with the values of the second image. M_NAND Performs a bitwise NAND operation between the values of the first and second images. M_NOR Performs a bitwise NOR operation between the values of the first and second images. M_OR Performs a bitwise OR operation between the values of the first and second images. M_SUB Subtracts the values of the second image from the values of the first image (for example, image 1 - image 2). M_SUB_ABS Takes the absolute value of the result of subtracting the values of the second image from the values of the first image. M_XNOR Performs a bitwise exclusive NOR operation between the values of the first and second images. M_XOR Performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation between the first and second images. Combination value for M_MAX_ABS , M_MIN_ABS. You can add the following value to the above-mentioned values to set the destination buffer to the source value of the selected pixel instead of the pixel's value used in the comparison. For specifying to save the source value Combination value Description M_SOURCE_VALUE Specifies to write the source value of the selected pixel into the destination buffer. When corresponding pixels from the two source images are compared based on the specified operation, MimArith() writes the source value of the pixel from the selected image into the destination buffer instead of the value used during the comparison. For example, if combined with M_MAX_ABS, after finding the maximum absolute value between the corresponding pixels in the two source images, MimArith() writes the source value of the bigger absolute value in the destination buffer. For a signed or unsigned destination buffer, the following logical operations will result in either the highest unsigned buffer value (regardless if the buffer is signed) or 0. For a floating-point buffer, the result will either be 0 or 1. Logical operations using two image buffer operands include the following. For logical operations using two image buffers Value Description M_EQUAL Determines if the values of the first and second images are equal. M_GREATER Determines if the values of the first image are greater than the second image. M_GREATER_OR_EQUAL Determines if the values of the first image are greater than or equal to the second image. M_LESS Determines if the values of the first image are less than the second image. M_LESS_OR_EQUAL Determines if the values of the first image are less than or equal to the second image. M_NOT_EQUAL Determines if the values of the first and second images are not equal. The following are operations that use an image buffer operand and a constant. If the operation is not commutative, you must pass the constant as either the first or second operand, as can be determined from the predefined operation name. For operations using one image buffer and a constant Value Description M_ADD_CONST Adds a constant to the values of an image. M_AND_CONST Performs a bitwise AND operation on the image and a constant. M_CONST_DIV Divides a constant by the values of an image (for example, constant / image). Note that dividing the constant by 0 will generate a destination pixel with an unpredictable value. This will not generate an error. M_CONST_EXP Raises a constant to the power specified by the values of an image. M_CONST_LOG Takes the logarithm of the values of an image, to the base of a constant (for example LOG constant Image). M_CONST_PASS Copies the constant to each destination pixel. M_CONST_SUB Subtracts the image from the constant (for example, constant - image). M_DIV_CONST Divides the values of an image by a constant (for example, image / constant). Note that dividing a value by 0 will generate an error. M_EXP_CONST Raises the values of the image to the power specified by the constant. M_LOG_CONST Takes the logarithm of a constant, to the base of the values of an image (for example LOG image Constant). M_MAX_CONST Compares the values of one image with a constant, and takes the maximum of the two. M_MIN_CONST Compares the values of one image with a constant, and takes the minimum of the two. M_MULT_CONST Multiplies the values of the image by the constant. M_NAND_CONST Performs a bitwise NAND operation with an image and a constant. M_NOR_CONST Performs a bitwise NOR operation with an image and a constant. M_OR_CONST Performs a bitwise OR operation with an image and a constant. M_SUB_CONST Subtracts a constant from the values of an image (for example, image - constant). M_SUB_CONST_ABS Takes the absolute value of the subtraction of a constant value from the values of the first image. M_XNOR_CONST Performs a bitwise exclusive NOR operation with an image and a constant. M_XOR_CONST Performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation with an image and a constant. Combination values for M_DIV , M_ADD_CONST , M_CONST_DIV , M_CONST_EXP , M_CONST_LOG , M_CONST_SUB , M_DIV_CONST , M_EXP_CONST , M_LOG_CONST , M_MULT_CONST , M_SUB_CONST. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to specify that the operation is performed in fixed-point or floating-point format. For specifying to perform operations in fixed-point or floating-point format Combination value Description M_FIXED_POINT Forces the operation to be performed in a fixed point format. Operations using this attribute result in an 0.8 fixed-point format for an 8-bit destination. That is, the 8 bits comprise only the fractional portion of the value, and no integer portion. When the destination image buffer is 16-bit, operations that use the M_FIXED_POINT attribute result in an 8.8 fixed-point format (where the eight most-significant bits are the integer portion and the eight least-significant bits are the fractional portion). For a 32-bit destination, the result is in a 16.16 fixed-point format. Note that this attribute cannot be used when using a floating-point destination buffer and it can only be used with M_CONST_DIV, M_DIV and M_DIV_CONST. In addition, this attribute cannot be used in combination with M_FLOAT_PROC. M_FLOAT_PROC Forces the operation to be performed in floating-point format. Note that, if the destination buffer is not a floating-point buffer, the resulting data of the operation will be truncated accordingly. This attribute cannot be used with M_DIV. In addition, this attribute cannot be used in combination with M_FIXED_POINT. For a signed or unsigned destination buffer, the following logical operations will result in either the highest unsigned buffer value (regardless if the buffer is signed) or 0. For a floating-point buffer, the result will either be 0 or 1. Logical operations using one image buffer and a constant include the following. For logical operations using one image buffer and a constant Value Description M_EQUAL_CONST Determines if the values of an image are equal to the specified constant. M_GREATER_CONST Determines if the values of an image are greater than the specified constant. M_GREATER_OR_EQUAL_CONST Determines if the values of an image are greater than or equal to the specified constant. M_LESS_CONST Determines if the values of an image are less than the specified constant. M_LESS_OR_EQUAL_CONST Determines if the values of an image are less than or equal to the specified constant. M_NOT_EQUAL_CONST Determines if the values of an image are not equal to the specified constant. Operations using only one image buffer operand are the following: For operations using one image buffer Value Description M_ABS Takes the absolute value of the image values. M_CEIL Rounds the image values up to the next integer. This operation is only supported with float source buffers. M_CUBE Raises the image values to the power of 3 ( x 3 ). M_FLOOR Rounds the image values down to the previous integer. This operation is only supported with float source buffers. M_INTEGRAL Takes the integral of the image. This computes the cumulative sum of the source image at the corresponding pixels in the destination. Each pixel in the destination buffer contains the total sum of the pixels in the rectangular sections delimited by the pixel at (0, 0) and itself, inclusively. M_LN Performs a natural logarithm on the image values. M_LOG2 Performs a base-2 logarithm on the image values. M_LOG10 Performs a base-10 logarithm on the image values. M_NEG Performs a unary negation operation (2's complement) on an image. For example, if a pixel has a binary value of 0x01000000 (corresponding to a decimal value of 64 in a signed buffer) and you perform an M_NEG operation on it, the resulting value will be 0x11000000 (corresponding to a decimal value of -64). This operation is buffer dependent. That is, a signed buffer with a value of 64 will be converted to -64, whereas an unsigned buffer with a value of 64 will be converted to 192. M_NOT Performs a bitwise NOT operation (1's complement) on an image. For example, if a pixel has a binary value of 0x01000000 (corresponding to a decimal value of 64 in an unsigned buffer) and you perform an M_NOT operation on it, the resulting value will be 0x10111111 (corresponding to a decimal value of 191). This operation is buffer dependent. That is, a signed buffer with a value of 64 will be converted to -63, whereas an unsigned buffer with a value of 64 will be converted to 191. M_PASS Copies the source buffer to the destination image buffer. M_ROUND Rounds image values to the nearest integer value, and values with decimal portion 0.5 are rounded to the nearest integer value, away from 0. For example, 1.5 is rounded to 2, while -1.5 is rounded to -2. This operation is only supported with float source buffers. M_ROUND_HALF_UP Rounds image values to the nearest integer value, and values with decimal portion 0.5 are rounded up to the next highest integer value. For example, 1.5 is rounded to 2, while -1.5 is rounded to -1. This operation is only supported with float source buffers. M_SQUARE Raises the image values to the power of 2 ( x 2 ). M_SQUARE_ROOT Performs a square root operation on the image values. M_TRUNC Removes the fractional portion of the image values, such that only the integer portion remains. For example, -1.3 truncates to -1, and 2.9 truncates to 2. This operation is only supported with float source buffers. Combination value for M_AND , M_NAND , M_NOR , M_OR , M_XNOR , M_XOR , M_AND_CONST , M_NAND_CONST , M_NOR_CONST , M_OR_CONST , M_XNOR_CONST , M_XOR_CONST , M_NOT. You can add the following value to the above-mentioned values to specify to use the logical operation rather than the bitwise operation. For specifying to perform logical operations Combination value Description M_LOGICAL Specifies to use the logical operation rather than the bitwise operation. The bitwise operation performs the specified operation on each binary digit. The logical operation determines the boolean state of the image pixel or constant based on whether it is equal to 0, and then performs the specified operation on that boolean state. In the destination buffer, a result of TRUE or FALSE is represented as 1 or 0, respectively. Combination value for M_ABS_SUB , M_ADD , M_AVG , M_EXP , M_LOG , M_MAX_ABS , M_MIN_ABS , M_MULT , M_SUB , M_SUB_ABS , M_ADD_CONST , M_CONST_EXP , M_CONST_LOG , M_CONST_SUB , M_EXP_CONST , M_LOG_CONST , M_MULT_CONST , M_SUB_CONST , M_SUB_CONST_ABS , M_CEIL , M_CUBE , M_FLOOR , M_INTEGRAL , M_LN , M_LOG2 , M_LOG10 , M_NEG , M_ROUND , M_ROUND_HALF_UP , M_SQUARE , M_SQUARE_ROOT , M_TRUNC. You can add the following value to the above-mentioned values to specify that the operation result should be saturated if necessary. For specifying to saturate results that overflow or underflow Combination value Description M_SATURATION Forces the operation to saturate any resulting pixel values that overflow or underflow the possible range of the destination buffer. The pixel values are clipped to fit within the buffer's range, rather than wrapped around the range. If you do not specify M_SATURATION and there is an overflow or underflow, the resulting pixel values are either clipped (saturated) or wrapped around the buffer's range (not saturated), depending on which is faster for your hardware. Remark Optimized in-place processing is supported (source equals destination), but the source and destination image buffers cannot partially overlap (a situation that can only occur when using child buffers).

Note that this function does not take 1-bit buffers in any of its parameters. You can limit this function's results to a region of an image buffer using a region of interest (ROI) set using MbufSetRegion().

For the Operation parameter Combination value Description M_SATURATION Forces the operation to saturate any resulting pixel values that overflow or underflow the possible range of the destination buffer. The pixel values are clipped to fit within the buffer's range, rather than wrapped around the range. If you do not specify M_SATURATION and there is an overflow or underflow, the resulting pixel values are either clipped (saturated) or wrapped around the buffer's range (not saturated), depending on which is faster for your hardware.

Syntax void MimAugment( MIL_ID&nbsp;AugmentationContextImId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufOrAugmentationResultImId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;SeedValue, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function performs an augmentation operation that allows you to create a plausible variation of an image. This is done by applying a specified ordered set of image processing operations with randomized settings within a specified range. To establish the image processing operations that MimAugment() can perform, call MimControl() with M_AUG_..._OP. MimAugment() places its results in the specified destination buffer, which can be an image or an augmentation result. The image processing operations that you specify MimAugment() to perform (M_AUG_..._OP) are prioritized as follows: 1. Affine operations, such as: M_AUG_ROTATION_OP M_AUG_SCALE_OP M_AUG_TRANSLATION_X_OP M_AUG_TRANSLATION_Y_OP M_AUG_ASPECT_RATIO_OP M_AUG_SHEAR_X_OP M_AUG_SHEAR_Y_OP 2. Structure operations, such as: M_AUG_DILATION_OP M_AUG_EROSION_OP M_AUG_DILATION_ASYM_OP M_AUG_EROSION_ASYM_OP 3. Geometric operations, such as: M_AUG_FLIP_OP M_AUG_CROP_OP 4. Intensity operations, such as: M_AUG_INTENSITY_MULTIPLY_OP M_AUG_INTENSITY_ADD_OP M_AUG_GAMMA_OP M_AUG_LIGHTING_DIRECTIONAL_OP M_AUG_SATURATION_GAIN_OP M_AUG_HUE_OFFSET_OP M_AUG_HSV_VALUE_GAIN_OP 5. Linear filter operations, such as: M_AUG_SMOOTH_DERICHE_OP M_AUG_SMOOTH_GAUSSIAN_OP M_AUG_BLUR_MOTION_OP M_AUG_SHARPEN_DERICHE_OP 6. Noise operations, such as: M_AUG_NOISE_GAUSSIAN_ADDITIVE_OP M_AUG_NOISE_MULTIPLICATIVE_OP M_AUG_NOISE_SALT_PEPPER_OP To modify the order in which MimAugment() prioritizes the specified image processing operations, call MimControl() with M_PRIORITY. Parameters Parameters AugmentationContextImId Specifies the identifier of the augmentation context. The context must have been allocated using MimAlloc() with M_AUGMENTATION_CONTEXT. SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source image buffer. If you are preprocessing the augmentation context (M_PREPROCESS), set this parameter to M_NULL. The image buffer can be grayscale or color (1- or 3-bands); it can be a 1-, 8-, or 16-bit unsigned buffer, or a 32-bit floating-point buffer (with values that are normalized between 0.0 and 1.0). You must allocate this buffer using MbufAlloc...() with M_IMAGE + M_PROC. You can perform any image processing operation (M_AUG_..._OP) on all supported source image buffers, except 1-bit unsigned images or 1-band images. 1-bit unsigned images do not support the following: M_AUG_BLUR_MOTION_OP M_AUG_GAMMA_OP M_AUG_HSV_VALUE_GAIN_OP M_AUG_HUE_OFFSET_OP M_AUG_INTENSITY_ADD_OP M_AUG_INTENSITY_MULTIPLY_OP M_AUG_LIGHTING_DIRECTIONAL_OP M_AUG_NOISE_GAUSSIAN_ADDITIVE_OP M_AUG_NOISE_MULTIPLICATIVE_OP M_AUG_NOISE_SALT_PEPPER_OP M_AUG_SATURATION_GAIN_OP M_AUG_SHARPEN_DERICHE_OP M_AUG_SMOOTH_DERICHE_OP M_AUG_SMOOTH_GAUSSIAN_OP 1-band images do not support the following: M_AUG_HUE_OFFSET_OP M_AUG_SATURATION_GAIN_OP M_AUG_HSV_VALUE_GAIN_OP When specifying a color (3-band) image, MimAugment() assumes an RGB color space by default. Operations that require a different color space (for example, HSV) internally convert the source image color. If your source image is not RGB, the conversion produces erroneous results. DstImageBufOrAugmentationResultImId Specifies the identifier of the destination in which to write the result of the augmentation transformation. The identifier must be for an image buffer or an augmentation image processing result buffer. If you are preprocessing the augmentation context (M_PREPROCESS), set this parameter to M_NULL. The image buffer can be grayscale or color (1- or 3-bands); it can be a 1-, 8-, or 16-bit unsigned buffer, or a 32-bit floating-point buffer. You must allocate this buffer using MbufAlloc...() with M_IMAGE + M_PROC. The augmentation result buffer must have been allocated on the required system using MimAllocResult() with M_AUGMENTATION_RESULT. If you specify an image buffer that has an ROI associated with it, the ROI must be in raster format; otherwise, you will get an error. SeedValue Specifies the initial value that will generate the randomized settings for the image processing operations used to perform the augmentation. This parameter must be set to one of the following values. For specifying the seed that will generate the randomized settings Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value. This depends on the seed mode, which is set using MimControl() with M_AUG_SEED_MODE. To use M_DEFAULT, the seed mode must be set to M_RNG_AUTO (default) or M_RNG_INIT_VALUE. M_NULL Specifies that you are preprocessing the augmentation context (M_PREPROCESS). Value &gt;= 0 Specifies a user-defined seed value. You can only specify a user-defined seed if MimControl() with M_AUG_SEED_MODE is set to M_USER_DEFINED_SEED. You cannot specify a value that is greater than the maximum value of a MIL_INT32. ControlFlag Specifies whether MimAugment() should perform the augmentation, or should explicitly preprocess the augmentation context. If you do not explicitly preprocess the context (M_PREPROCESS), MimAugment() preprocesses it the first time you call the function. This parameter must be set to one of the following values. For specifying the operation to perform Value Description M_DEFAULT Performs the augmentation. M_PREPROCESS Preprocesses the specified augmentation context explicitly. In this case, you must set the SrcImageBufId, DstImageBufOrAugmentationResultImId, and SeedValue parameters to M_NULL. Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; milim.lib.

Syntax MIL_INT MimBinarize( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ConditionAndThreshMode, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;LowParam, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;HighParam //in ) Description This function performs a binary threshold operation on the specified image. Each pixel that meets the specified condition is set to the highest unsigned destination buffer value, while other pixels are set to 0. For example, the highest buffer value for an 8-bit buffer is 0xff (regardless if the source buffer is signed). If a floating-point destination buffer is specified, pixels that meet the condition are set to 1. There are 6 ways to establish the threshold value(s): two that require you to explicitly specify the threshold value(s) (M_FIXED and M_PERCENTILE_VALUE) and four that automatically base the threshold value(s) on the histogram (M_BIMODAL, M_DOMINANT, M_TRIANGLE_BISECTION_DARK, and M_TRIANGLE_BISECTION_BRIGHT). You can limit this function's results to a region of an image buffer using a region of interest (ROI) set using MbufSetRegion(). The ROI must be defined in raster format (M_RASTER or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error is generated if the ROI is only in vector format (M_VECTOR). Parameters Parameters SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the data source of the operation. This parameter must be given an image buffer identifier. This image buffer can have an ROI set using MbufSetRegion(). The ROI must be defined in raster format (M_RASTER or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error is generated if the ROI is only in vector format (M_VECTOR). DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer in which to write the results. In general, this parameter must be given an image buffer identifier. This image buffer can have an ROI set using MbufSetRegion(). The ROI must be defined in raster format (M_RASTER or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error is generated if the ROI is only in vector format (M_VECTOR). To return only the automatically calculated threshold value, if applicable, set the DstImageBufId parameter to M_NULL. Note that if the DstImageBufId parameter is set to M_NULL, the MimBinarize() function will be forced to run synchronously. ConditionAndThreshMode Specifies the condition, as well as the threshold mode to use to establish the threshold value(s) of the condition. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. LowParam Specifies either the lower limit of the selected condition or the minimum value to use when establishing the threshold. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. HighParam Specifies either the upper limit of the selected condition or the maximum value to use when establishing the threshold. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Parameter associations The table below lists possible values for the ConditionAndThreshMode, LowParam, and HighParam parameters. For controlling the threshold determination mode The following conditions allow you to control the threshold determination mode used. For controlling the threshold determination mode ConditionAndThreshMode Description LowParam HighParam M_BIMODAL Specifies to automatically establish the threshold value for the condition from the source image's histogram, using the bimodal threshold mode. This threshold mode can only be used if the condition uses one limit. In this mode, if the source image's histogram contains only two peaks, the threshold value is set to the intensity value at the lowest point between these two peaks of the histogram, on the assumption that these peaks represent the object and the background. If the histogram contains more than two peaks, the threshold value will typically be set between the intensity values at the two principal peaks, although exceptions exist for the situations where the principal peaks occur are closest to the minimum intensity value (pure black) or the maximum intensity value (full saturation). Note that the bimodal threshold mode works best when the histogram contains two visible peaks. You can limit the intensity value range of the histogram from which the threshold value is established. To do so, use the LowParam and HighParam parameters. You must specify a combination value from the following table: To specify a threshold condition LowParam Sets the minimum pixel value in the source image's histogram to use when establishing the threshold value. M_NULL Specifies to use the full range of pixel values in the histogram. This setting is only valid when HighParam is also set to M_NULL. Value Specifies the minimum pixel value. The minimum value must be less than or equal to the maximum value. HighParam Sets the maximum pixel value in the source image's histogram to use when establishing the threshold value. M_NULL Specifies to use the full range of pixel values in the histogram. This setting is only valid when LowParam is also set to M_NULL. Value Specifies the maximum pixel value. The maximum value must be greater than or equal to the minimum value. M_DOMINANT Specifies to automatically establish the threshold value for the condition from the source image's histogram, using the dominant threshold mode. This threshold mode can only be used if the condition uses one limit. In this mode, the threshold value is set to isolate the dominant peak of the source image's histogram. If the histogram contains two peaks, the threshold is set to the intensity value at the lowest point between these two peaks. If the histogram contains more than two peaks, the threshold value is set at the lowest point between the dominant peak and its nearest peak on the right or left, depending on the pixel distribution in the histogram. If there are more pixels represented on the left side of the dominant peak, then the threshold will be set to the left of the peak. If there are more pixels represented on the right side of the dominant peak, then the threshold will be set to the right of the peak. Note that the dominant threshold mode works best when the histogram contains clearly identifiable peaks. You can limit the intensity value range of the histogram from which the threshold value is established. To do so, use the LowParam and HighParam parameters. You must specify a combination value from the following table: To specify a threshold condition LowParam Sets the minimum pixel value in the source image's histogram to use when establishing the threshold value. M_NULL Specifies to use the full range of pixel values in the histogram. This setting is only valid when HighParam is also set to M_NULL. Value Specifies the minimum pixel value. The minimum value must be less than or equal to the maximum value. HighParam Sets the maximum pixel value in the source image's histogram to use when establishing the threshold value. M_NULL Specifies to use the full range of pixel values in the histogram. This setting is only valid when LowParam is also set to M_NULL. Value Specifies the maximum pixel value. The maximum value must be greater than or equal to the minimum value. M_FIXED Specifies that the threshold value(s) for the condition are specified explicitly. You must specify a combination value from the following table: To specify a threshold condition LowParam Sets the threshold value to use as the lower limit of the selected condition. The lower limit must be less than or equal to the upper limit. HighParam Sets the upper limit of the selected condition. M_NULL Specifies not to use an upper limit. Use this setting when the condition uses only one limit. Value Specifies the threshold value to use as the upper limit of the selected condition. The upper limit must be greater than or equal to the lower limit. M_PERCENTILE_VALUE Specifies that the threshold value(s) for the condition are specified as a percentage of the source image's histogram data. In this mode, you specify a threshold value by specifying the percentage of pixels that must be equal to or less than the required threshold value. You must specify a combination value from the following table: To specify a threshold condition LowParam Sets the lower limit of the selected condition. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100 Specifies the lower limit as a percentage of the source image's histogram data. The lower limit must be less than or equal to the upper limit. HighParam Sets the upper limit of the selected condition. M_NULL Specifies not to use an upper limit. Use this setting when the condition uses only one limit. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100 Specifies the upper limit as a percentage of the source image's histogram data. The upper limit must be greater than or equal to the lower limit. M_TRIANGLE_BISECTION_BRIGHT Specifies to automatically establish the threshold value for the condition from the source image's histogram, using the bright triangle bisection threshold mode. This threshold mode can only be used if the condition uses one limit. In bright triangular bisection threshold mode, MIL establishes the tallest peak in the source image's histogram (the most commonly-occurring value) and the lowest point (the least commonly-occurring value) when heading from the peak toward its maximum intensity value. It then connects these two points by a line. The threshold value is the intensity value at the point furthest below that line (the inflection point). Note that all points above the line are ignored. You can limit the intensity value range of the histogram from which the threshold value is established. To do so, use the LowParam and HighParam parameters. You must specify a combination value from the following table: To specify a threshold condition LowParam Sets the minimum pixel value in the source image's histogram to use when establishing the threshold value. M_NULL Specifies to use the full range of pixel values in the histogram. This setting is only valid when HighParam is also set to M_NULL. Value Specifies the minimum pixel value. The minimum value must be less than or equal to the maximum value. HighParam Sets the maximum pixel value in the source image's histogram to use when establishing the threshold value. M_NULL Specifies to use the full range of pixel values in the histogram. This setting is only valid when LowParam is also set to M_NULL. Value Specifies the maximum pixel value. The maximum value must be greater than or equal to the minimum value. M_TRIANGLE_BISECTION_DARK Specifies to automatically establish the threshold value for the condition from the source image's histogram, using the dark triangle bisection threshold mode. This threshold mode can only be used if the condition uses one limit. In dark triangular bisection threshold mode, MIL establishes the tallest peak in the source image's histogram (the most commonly-occurring value) and the lowest point (the least commonly-occurring value) when heading from the peak toward its minimum intensity value. It then connects these two points by a line. The threshold value is the intensify value at the point furthest below that line (the inflection point). Note that all points above the line are ignored. You can limit the intensity value range of the histogram from which the threshold value is established. To do so, use the LowParam and HighParam parameters. You must specify a combination value from the following table: To specify a threshold condition LowParam Sets the minimum pixel value in the source image's histogram to use when establishing the threshold value. M_NULL Specifies to use the full range of pixel values in the histogram. This setting is only valid when HighParam is also set to M_NULL. Value Specifies the minimum pixel value. The minimum value must be less than or equal to the maximum value. HighParam Sets the maximum pixel value in the source image's histogram to use when establishing the threshold value. M_NULL Specifies to use the full range of pixel values in the histogram. This setting is only valid when LowParam is also set to M_NULL. Value Specifies the maximum pixel value. The maximum value must be greater than or equal to the minimum value. Combination values for the values listed in For controlling the threshold determination mode. You must add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to specify a threshold condition. For specifying a threshold condition Combination value Description M_EQUAL Sets pixel values equal to the threshold value to the highest buffer value possible, while other pixels are set to zero. Note that if using a floating-point destination buffer, pixels that meet the condition are set to 1. M_GREATER Sets pixel values greater than the threshold value to the highest buffer value possible, while other pixels are set to zero. Note that if using a floating-point destination buffer, pixels that meet the condition are set to 1. M_GREATER_OR_EQUAL Sets pixel values greater than or equal to the threshold value to the highest buffer value possible, while other pixels are set to zero. Note that if using a floating-point destination buffer, pixels that meet the condition are set to 1. M_IN_RANGE Sets pixels with values between the lower threshold value and the higher threshold value, inclusive, to the highest buffer value. Other pixels are set to 0. Note that this is only applicable to constants that can use two limits (M_FIXED and M_PERCENTILE_VALUE). If a floating-point destination buffer is specified, pixels that meet the condition are set to 1. M_LESS Sets pixel values less than the threshold value to the highest buffer value possible, while other pixels are set to zero. Note that if using a floating-point destination buffer, pixels that meet the condition are set to 1. M_LESS_OR_EQUAL Sets pixel values less than or equal to the threshold value to the highest buffer value possible, while other pixels are set to zero. Note that if using a floating-point destination buffer, pixels that meet the condition are set to 1. M_NOT_EQUAL Sets pixel values not equal to the threshold value to the highest buffer value possible, while other pixels are set to zero. Note that if using a floating-point destination buffer, pixels that meet the condition are set to 1. M_OUT_RANGE Sets pixels with values less than the lower threshold value or greater than the higher threshold value, to the highest buffer value. Other pixels are set to 0. Note that this is only applicable to constants that can use two limits (M_FIXED and M_PERCENTILE_VALUE). If a floating-point destination buffer is specified, pixels that meet the condition are set to 1. Return value When DstImageBufId is given an image buffer identifier, this function returns the specified value of the LowParam parameter. When DstImageBufId is set to M_NULL and the ConditionAndThreshMode parameter is set to one of the automatic threshold modes (M_BIMODAL, M_TRIANGLE_BISECTION_DARK, or M_TRIANGLE_BISECTION_BRIGHT), this function returns the automatically calculated threshold value. If the ConditionAndThreshMode parameter is set to M_PERCENTILE_VALUE, this function returns the threshold value established from the specified lower limit. When dealing with floating-point source buffers, the returned threshold is truncated to an integer value. Therefore, the returned threshold and the actual threshold used to binarize can differ. Remark Optimized in-place processing is supported (source equals destination), but the source and destination image buffers cannot partially overlap (a situation that can only occur when using child buffers).

Syntax void MimBinarizeAdaptive( MIL_ID&nbsp;AdaptiveBinarizeContextImId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SeedImage1BufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SeedImage2BufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;BinarizedImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;ThresholdImageBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function performs an adaptive binary threshold operation on the specified image and places the resulting binarized image in the specified buffer. This function also provides the threshold values with which it binarized the image. To perform the adaptive binarization, this function establishes a threshold value for each pixel in the source, according to the context's threshold mode. Each source pixel that is greater than its corresponding threshold value is set to the highest unsigned destination buffer value. For example, for 1-, 8-, and 16-bit destination buffers (signed or unsigned), the highest values are 1, 0xFF, and 0xFFFF, respectively. For 32-bit floating-point destination buffers, the highest value is 1. Source pixels that are less than or equal to their corresponding threshold value are set to 0, for destination buffers of any type. To specify a particular mode with which to calculate threshold values, call MimControl() with M_THRESHOLD_MODE. Available threshold modes generally refer to adaptive algorithms, which perform multiple calculations on individual sections of an image. When compared to a conventional binarization (MimBinarize()), which calculates threshold values using an image as a whole, an adaptive binarization is more robust at processing images with objects that are difficult to identify. Such difficulties typically come from changes in illumination and poor or varying contrast. This type of robustness can cause an adaptive binarization to take longer to execute than a conventional one. You can modify controls other than threshold mode to customize calculations, such as indicating a maximum (M_GLOBAL_MAX) or minimum (M_GLOBAL_MIN) threshold value. Available controls depend on the type of the adaptive binarization context. Image buffers specified with this function can be grayscale or color. 1-bit, 8-bit, and 16-bit buffers are supported; their type can be signed or unsigned. 32-bit buffers are also supported; their type must be float. For best results, all image buffers should have the same number of bands and be the same type. Parameters Parameters AdaptiveBinarizeContextImId Specifies the identifier of the adaptive binarization context. The context must have been allocated using MimAlloc() with either M_BINARIZE_ADAPTIVE_CONTEXT or M_BINARIZE_ADAPTIVE_FROM_SEED_CONTEXT. SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source image buffer with which to perform the adaptive binarization. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it.

If the condition has one clipping point, each pixel that satisfies this condition is replaced with the specified WriteLow value. If it has two clipping points, the pixels are either replaced with the WriteLow or WriteHigh value depending on the condition. Pixels that do not satisfy the condition are not replaced. Instead, they are copied as is to the destination buffer. You can limit this function's results to a region of an image buffer using a region of interest (ROI) set using MbufSetRegion(). The ROI must be defined in raster format (M_RASTER or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error is generated if the ROI is only in vector format (M_VECTOR).

CondLow = 25 WriteLow = 255 CondLow Specifies the lower clipping point of the selected condition. If the condition uses only one limit, use this parameter to specify the required limit. For specifying the lower clipping point Value Description M_NULL Specifies that the lower limit is based on the minimum value of the destination image buffer's data type. You must set CondLow to this value when the condition is set to M_SATURATION. Value Specifies the lower limit. This value is cast to the source buffer's data type and interpreted accordingly. Note, if the source buffer is binary, CondLow must be equal to 0 or 1. CondHigh Specifies the upper clipping point of the selected condition.

Note, if the source buffer is binary, CondHigh must be equal to 0 or 1. WriteLow Specifies the value to write to the destination buffer when a pixel satisfies the specified low clipping condition. If the condition uses only one replacement value, use this parameter to specify the required value. For specifying the value to write to the destination buffer when a pixel satisfies the specified low clipping point Value Description M_NULL Specifies that the value to write is the minimum value of the destination image buffer's data type. You must set WriteLow to this value when the condition is set to M_SATURATION. Value Specifies the value to write when the pixel satisfies the low clipping condition. This value is cast to the destination buffer's data type. Note, if the destination buffer is binary, WriteLow must be equal to 0 or 1. WriteHigh Specifies the value to write to the destination buffer when a pixel satisfies the specified high clipping condition. If the condition uses only one replacement value, this parameter is not used and must be set to M_NULL.

It calculates a connectivity code for each pixel in the source image, treating the source image as if it were binary (that is, all non-zero pixels are treated as 1); it then maps the codes through the specified LUT buffer. Specifically, for each source pixel, this function concatenates the binary values of the pixels in a pixel's 3x3 neighborhood, and then uses this 9-bit number to address the specified LUT. The value at this LUT address is then written in the specified destination buffer at the pixel's corresponding position.

The image processing context or result buffer must have been previously allocated on the system using MimAlloc() or MimAllocResult(), respectively. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ControlType Specifies the processing feature to control. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ControlValue Specifies the value needed for the control. When the ControlValue is an image buffer, the internal representation of the image stored in the image processing context might not be the same as the original image. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Parameter associations The table below lists possible values for the ContextOrResultImId, ControlType, and ControlValue parameters. For specifying the control type and control value for an image processing context or result buffer The following ContextOrResultImId, ControlType, and ControlValue parameter settings can be specified for different types of image processing contexts or result buffers. For specifying the control type and control value for an image processing context or result buffer ContextOrResultImId Description ControlType ControlValue Adaptive binarize context ID Specifies an adaptive binarize context, allocated using MimAlloc() with M_BINARIZE_ADAPTIVE_CONTEXT, and used in MimBinarizeAdaptive() operations. The main setting with which to control an adaptive binarize context is M_THRESHOLD_MODE. In general, all other control settings are used by the specified thresholding process to establish the threshold values with which to binarize. M_AVERAGE_MODE Sets how MIL establishes average pixel values that can be required to determine threshold values. This is typically used when M_THRESHOLD_MODE is set to M_NIBLACK or M_LOCAL_MEAN. M_DEFAULT Same as M_UNIFORM. M_GAUSSIAN Specifies a Gaussian type average. M_UNIFORM Specifies a uniform type average. M_FOREGROUND_VALUE Sets whether the objects to binarize are lighter or darker than the background. M_DEFAULT Same as M_FOREGROUND_WHITE. M_FOREGROUND_BLACK Specifies that the objects to binarize are darker than the background. M_FOREGROUND_WHITE Specifies that the objects to binarize are lighter than the background. M_GLOBAL_MAX Sets the maximum threshold value. The threshold destination image (MimBinarizeAdaptive()) cannot hold values higher than M_GLOBAL_MAX. Higher threshold values are clipped. If the source image (MimBinarizeAdaptive()) also has a maximum value restriction (MbufControl() with M_MAX), MIL uses the lower maximum value as the actual maximum. Before calling MimBinarizeAdaptive(), if both M_GLOBAL_MAX and M_GLOBAL_MIN are set to values, then M_GLOBAL_MAX must be greater than or equal to M_GLOBAL_MIN. By default, MIL binarizes pixels with an intensity higher than the maximum as part of the foreground (object). To change this behavior, use the M_FOREGROUND_VALUE control. M_DEFAULT Specifies that there is no maximum threshold value restriction imposed by M_GLOBAL_MAX. Value Specifies the maximum threshold value. M_GLOBAL_MIN Sets the minimum threshold value. The threshold destination image (MimBinarizeAdaptive()) cannot hold values lower than M_GLOBAL_MIN. Lower threshold values are clipped. If the source image (MimBinarizeAdaptive()) also has a minimum value restriction (MbufControl() with M_MIN), MIL uses the greater minimum value as the actual maximum. Before calling MimBinarizeAdaptive(), if both M_GLOBAL_MIN and M_GLOBAL_MAX are set to values, then M_GLOBAL_MIN must be less than or equal to M_GLOBAL_MAX. By default, MIL binarizes pixels with an intensity lower than the minimum as part of the background. To change this behavior, use the M_FOREGROUND_VALUE control. M_DEFAULT Specifies that there is no minimum threshold value restriction imposed by M_GLOBAL_MIN. Value Specifies the minimum threshold value. M_GLOBAL_OFFSET Sets the offset to add to each threshold value. MimBinarizeAdaptive() uses the adjusted threshold values. The specified offset is reflected in the threshold destination image (MimBinarizeAdaptive()). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value Specifies the offset. M_GLOBAL_OFFSET_SECOND_PASS Sets the offset to apply to the threshold values for the second pass of a hysteresis adaptive binarization. MIL applies the offset for the second pass in the same way that it applies the offset for the first pass (M_GLOBAL_OFFSET). For M_GLOBAL_OFFSET_SECOND_PASS to have an effect, you must specify a threshold type other than M_SINGLE. For an M_NIBLACK threshold mode, either M_GLOBAL_OFFSET_SECOND_PASS must have a value different from M_GLOBAL_OFFSET, or M_NIBLACK_BIAS_SECOND_PASS must have a value different from M_NIBLACK_BIAS; otherwise, MIL generates an error. For other threshold modes, MIL generates an error if M_GLOBAL_OFFSET_SECOND_PASS and M_GLOBAL_OFFSET have the same value. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value Specifies the offset. M_LOCAL_DIMENSION Specifies the size of the neighborhood that the threshold mode uses to establish threshold values. For an M_NIBLACK or M_LOCAL_MEAN threshold mode, the size should be the largest square that represents a uniform background. The size should also be greater than the object's expected thickness. For an M_BERNSEN threshold mode, the size should be slightly larger than half the object's expected thickness. For an M_PSEUDOMEDIAN threshold mode, the size should be half the object's expected thickness. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 15 pixels. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the size of the neighborhood, in pixels. Only integer values accepted. M_MINIMUM_CONTRAST Sets the minimum contrast between background and foreground (object) pixels. MIL binarizes (classifies) pixels in a neighborhood as background if they do not meet the minimum contrast. An M_LOCAL_MEAN threshold mode ignores the minimum contrast. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 5.0. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the minimum contrast. M_NIBLACK_BIAS Sets the bias for Niblack's binarization mode. This value only has an effect if M_THRESHOLD_MODE is set to M_NIBLACK. The bias gives you some general control over thresholding. A higher bias binarizes fainter values as part of the object. A lower bias binarizes fainter values as part of the background. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.2. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the bias. Typical values range from 0.1 to 0.3. M_NIBLACK_BIAS_SECOND_PASS Sets the bias for the second pass of a Niblack adaptive binarization that uses a hysteresis process. For this control type to have an effect, you must specify an M_NIBLACK threshold mode and you must specify a threshold type other than M_SINGLE. Either M_NIBLACK_BIAS_SECOND_PASS must have a value different from M_NIBLACK_BIAS, or M_GLOBAL_OFFSET_SECOND_PASS must have a value different from M_GLOBAL_OFFSET; otherwise, MIL generates an error. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.2. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the bias. M_THRESHOLD_MODE Sets how MIL establishes the threshold values with which to binarize the source image. M_DEFAULT Same as M_NIBLACK. M_BERNSEN Specifies that threshold values are established using Bernsen's adaptive threshold algorithm. This represents a type of morphological erosion and dilation. This threshold results in the fastest process. M_LOCAL_MEAN Specifies that threshold values are established using adaptive local mean calculations. This is a simplified version of M_NIBLACK. M_LOCAL_MEAN usually results in a faster, though less precise, binarization than M_NIBLACK. M_NIBLACK Specifies that threshold values are established using Niblack's adaptive threshold algorithm. This setting offers the highest precision. The processing time is usually quite quick. M_PSEUDOMEDIAN Specifies that threshold values are established using adaptive pseudomedian calculations. This is similar to an M_BERNSEN threshold, except it represents a type of morphological open or close process instead of erosion or dilation. M_THRESHOLD_TYPE Sets the type of threshold to use for the adaptive binarization. M_DEFAULT Same as M_SINGLE. M_HYSTERESIS Specifies that the adaptive binarization uses a hysteresis process. In this case, MIL performs a geodesic reconstruction (a type of morphological operation) after a second pass of the specified threshold. Regardless of the threshold mode, MIL uses M_GLOBAL_OFFSET_SECOND_PASS instead of M_GLOBAL_OFFSET during the second pass of MimBinarizeAdaptive(). For an M_NIBLACK threshold mode, the second pass uses M_NIBLACK_BIAS_SECOND_PASS instead of M_NIBLACK_BIAS. MIL generates an error if every M_..._SECOND_PASS value it uses is the same as its first pass counterpart. M_IN_RANGE Specifies to use the values inside the range defined by the two passes as the foreground. M_OUT_RANGE Specifies to use the values outside the range defined by the two passes as the foreground. M_SINGLE Specifies to use a single pass of the specified threshold. Hysteresis is not used. Adaptive binarize from seed context ID Specifies an adaptive binarize context that uses seeds, allocated using MimAlloc() with M_BINARIZE_ADAPTIVE_FROM_SEED_CONTEXT, and used in MimBinarizeAdaptive() operations. The main setting with which to control an adaptive binarize context that uses seeds is M_THRESHOLD_MODE. In general, all other control settings are used by the specified thresholding process to establish the threshold values with which to binarize. M_FOREGROUND_VALUE Sets whether the objects to binarize are lighter or darker than the background. M_DEFAULT Same as M_FOREGROUND_WHITE. M_FOREGROUND_BLACK Specifies that the objects to binarize are darker than the background. M_FOREGROUND_WHITE Specifies that the objects to binarize are lighter than the background. M_GLOBAL_OFFSET Sets the offset to add to each established threshold value. Binarization uses the adjusted threshold values, however offsets do not change the threshold values themselves. The content of the threshold destination image (MimBinarizeAdaptive() with ThresholdImageBufId) remains unaltered. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value Specifies the offset. M_NB_ITERATIONS Sets the number of times to perform the adaptive threshold process specified with M_THRESHOLD_MODE. M_DEFAULT Same as M_TO_IDEMPOTENCE. M_TO_IDEMPOTENCE Specifies that the threshold process iterates until idempotence is reached. This is the number of iterations at which subsequent iterations do not alter results. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the number of iterations. Only integer values accepted. The threshold process for an M_TOGGLE threshold mode is always performed once. M_NB_SEED_ITERATIONS Sets the number of iterations with which to internally establish the seeds that the threshold mode requires. This value only has an effect if you do not specify your own seed images with MimBinarizeAdaptive(). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the number of iterations. Only integer values accepted. M_THRESHOLD_MODE Sets how MIL uses seeds to establish the threshold values with which to binarize the source image. You can provide the required seed images when you call MimBinarizeAdaptive(). If you do not, MIL internally establishes the seed data. M_DEFAULT Same as M_RECONSTRUCT. M_LEVEL Specifies that threshold values are established using an adaptive leveling. This essentially performs two geodesic reconstructions. One that processes the foreground as white, and the other that processes the foreground as black. This results in M_LEVEL generally taking twice as long as M_RECONSTRUCT. M_LEVEL uses one seed image. M_RECONSTRUCT Specifies that threshold values are established using an adaptive geodesic reconstruction. This represents a type of morphological erosion or dilation.

M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 10. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the maximum translation in the Y-direction. Cumulative statistics image processing context ID Specifies a cumulative statistics image processing context, allocated using MimAlloc() with M_STATISTICS_CUMULATIVE_CONTEXT, and used in MimStatCalculate() operations. To process multiple images, call MimStatCalculate() multiple times, each time with a different source image. Note that the source image must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Note, use multiple calls to this function to enable multiple statistical operations. Enabling fewer statistics will help increase the speed of the operation. M_SOURCE_SIZE_X Sets the width of a typical source image. This value is only used when not providing a source image to MimStatCalculate() with M_PREPROCESS. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the width of a typical source image, in pixels. M_SOURCE_SIZE_Y Sets the height of a typical source image. This value is only used when not providing a source image to MimStatCalculate() with M_PREPROCESS.

M_DISABLE Specifies not to perform this statistical operation. M_ENABLE Specifies to perform this statistical operation. Dead pixel correction image processing context ID Specifies a dead pixel correction image processing context, allocated using MimAlloc() with M_DEAD_PIXEL_CONTEXT, and used in MimDeadPixelCorrection() operations. M_DEAD_PIXELS Sets the dead pixels image buffer used to identify dead pixels in the source image, where all non-zero pixels are considered dead pixels. Note that you should only use this control type if you have not specified a series of values that identify the dead pixels, using MimPut() with M_XY_DEAD_PIXELS. Dead pixel mask image buffer ID Specifies identifier of the image buffer containing the dead pixel mask. The buffer must be a single-band image buffer, allocated using MbufAlloc...(). This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. M_INTERPOLATION_MODE Sets the interpolation mode. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AVERAGE. M_AVERAGE Specifies to overwrite a dead pixel with an interpolation performed using a weighted average of all its neighboring pixels in the source image. Deinterlacing image processing context ID Specifies a deinterlacing image processing context, allocated using MimAlloc() with M_DEINTERLACE_CONTEXT, and used in MimDeinterlace() operations. M_DEINTERLACE_TYPE Sets the deinterlacing algorithm to use. The chosen algorithm can either be applied to all the pixels in the source image or to the pixels that are part of an object in motion (adaptive version of the algorithm). To determine if a pixel is part of a moving object, the adaptive algorithm compares it with the pixel at the same location in neighboring frames. If the difference between the maximum and minimum pixel intensity exceeds a set threshold (M_MOTION_DETECT_THRESHOLD), then the pixel is considered to be part of a moving object. Otherwise, the pixel is considered to be part of the background. The deinterlacing algorithm is not applied to the background pixels. Instead, the background pixels in the output image will be formed by the corresponding pixels in the even or odd field. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISCARD. M_ADAPTIVE_AVERAGE Specifies that the average algorithm is applied to the pixels that are considered to be part of a moving object and leaves the background pixels unchanged. M_ADAPTIVE_BOB Specifies that the bob algorithm is applied to the pixels that are considered to be part of a moving object and leaves the background pixels unchanged. M_ADAPTIVE_DISCARD Specifies that the discard algorithm is applied to the pixels that are considered to be part of a moving object and leaves the background pixels unchanged. M_AVERAGE Performs the averaging algorithm. This algorithm is equivalent to performing the discard algorithm twice, once using the first field in the frame and once using the second. The resulting two frames will then be averaged to form one deinterlaced output frame. M_BOB Performs the bob algorithm. This algorithm performs the discard algorithm twice, once using the first field in the frame and once using the second. The result is two output frames. Therefore, the output frame rate is twice as high as the input frame rate. M_DISCARD Performs the discard algorithm. This algorithm takes one field from the source image and discards the other. The second field is then calculated from this field. Each row of the second field is obtained by averaging the two corresponding neighboring rows in the first field. For example, the first row of the second field is calculated from the average of the first and second rows of the first field. M_DISCARD_FIELD Sets the field to discard when using the M_DISCARD or M_ADAPTIVE_DISCARD algorithm. Note, in the averaging and bob algorithms, the discard algorithm is called twice; the first field is discarded on the first call and the second field is discarded on the second call. M_DEFAULT Same as M_EVEN_FIELD. M_EVEN_FIELD Specifies that the even field is discarded. M_ODD_FIELD Specifies that the odd field is discarded. M_FIRST_FIELD Sets the first field to be processed for each input frame and consequently sets the order of the output frames when using the M_BOB or M_ADAPTIVE_BOB algorithm. M_DEFAULT Same as M_EVEN_FIELD. M_EVEN_FIELD Specifies that the even field will be processed first. M_ODD_FIELD Specifies that the odd field will be processed first. M_MOTION_DETECT_NUM_FRAMES Sets the number of frames to use for comparison purposes to determine if a pixel is part of an object in motion. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 2. Value &gt; 1 Specifies the number of frames. M_MOTION_DETECT_OUTPUT Sets whether the output images of MimDeinterlace() are deinterlaced images or images indicating which pixels are considered to be part of an object in motion (the internal motion detection mask). In the latter case, the pixel values are either 0, if they are part of a background object, or the maximum unsigned value (0xFF for an 8 bit image), if they are part of an object in motion. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that the output images are the deinterlaced images. M_ENABLE Specifies that the output images indicate the background pixels and the pixels that are considered to be part of the object in motion. M_MOTION_DETECT_REFERENCE_FRAME Sets the index of the frame to process within the group of frames that are used for motion detection. This frame is used as the reference frame. M_DEFAULT Same as M_CENTER_FRAME. M_CENTER_FRAME Specifies that the center frame in the group is used as the reference frame. M_FIRST_FRAME Specifies that the first frame in the group is used as the reference frame. M_LAST_FRAME Specifies that the last frame in the group is used as the reference frame. 0 &lt;= Value &lt; M_MOTION_DETECT_NUM_FRAMES Specifies the index of the frame relative to the first frame of the group. The first frame of the group has index 0. M_MOTION_DETECT_THRESHOLD Sets the threshold value used to differentiate between pixels that are part of objects in motion and background pixels. Each pixel is compared with the pixel at the same location in neighboring frames. If the difference between the maximum and minimum pixel intensity exceeds the specified threshold, the pixel is considered part of a moving object. Otherwise, it is considered part of the background. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the threshold. M_SOURCE_FIRST_IMAGE Sets the index of the input image used to generate the first deinterlaced image. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the index of the image in the source image array. Event list image processing result ID Specifies an event list image processing result buffer, allocated using MimAllocResult() with M_EVENT_LIST, and used in MimLocateEvent() operations. M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS Sets whether to return results in pixels or world units. This essentially sets the output coordinate system to use. The setting of this control type will only affect functions within this module which return positional results. This control type can be changed at any time to return results in the required output units. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ACCORDING_TO_CALIBRATION. M_ACCORDING_TO_CALIBRATION Specifies that results are returned in world units if the result was calculated on an image associated with a camera calibration context; otherwise, specifies that results are returned in pixel units. M_PIXEL Specifies that results are returned in pixel units, with respect to the pixel coordinate system. M_WORLD Specifies that results are returned in world units, with respect to the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, calling MimGetResult() or MimGetResult1d() generates an error if the result was not calculated on a calibrated image. Filter majority image processing context ID Specifies a filter majority image processing context identifier, allocated using MimAlloc() with M_FILTER_MAJORITY_CONTEXT, and used in MimFilterMajority() operations. M_IGNORED_VALUE Sets a single pixel value to ignore. If a pixel value in the neighborhood matches the ignored value, it will not be counted; the pixel is essentially excluded from the neighborhood. For example, if you want to ignore a background color present in your source image, you can set this control type to the value of the pixels corresponding to the background color. If you want to use this control type, you must also set M_USE_IGNORED_VALUE to M_ENABLE. The default value of this control type is 0. If you set M_USE_IGNORED_VALUE to M_ENABLE but do not specify a value to ignore, pixels whose values are 0 will be ignored. Value Specifies the pixel value to ignore. The default value is 0. M_TIE_BREAKER_MODE Sets the method used to break a tie in the neighborhood. In the case of a tie (two or more pixel values occur with the greatest frequency in the neighborhood), this control type specifies which value should be selected to replace the value of the central pixel. M_DEFAULT Same as M_MIN. M_MAX Specifies to replace the central pixel value with the greatest value present among the tied values. If you have specified weights for your neighborhood and have set M_USE_FREQUENCY_TIE_BREAKER to M_ENABLE, this control value specifies to replace the central pixel value with the most common (greatest non-weighted frequency) value present among the tied values. M_MEDIAN Specifies to replace the central pixel value with the median value present among the tied values. If you have specified weights for your neighborhood and have set M_USE_FREQUENCY_TIE_BREAKER to M_ENABLE, this control value specifies to replace the central pixel value with the value that has the median non-weighted frequency present among the tied values. M_MIN Specifies to replace the central pixel value with the smallest value present that appears among the tied values. If you have specified weights for your neighborhood and have set M_USE_FREQUENCY_TIE_BREAKER to M_ENABLE, this control value specifies to replace the central pixel value with the least common (lowest non-weighted frequency) value present among the tied values. M_USE_FREQUENCY_TIE_BREAKER Sets whether the control type M_TIE_BREAKER_MODE should break a tie in the neighborhood using the values present or, if weights are specified, using the non-weighted frequency at which the tied values appear. If you have specified weights for the pixels in your neighborhood, it is possible that two pixel values are tied despite not occurring with equal frequency in the neighborhood. For example, if your neighborhood contains four pixels with value 5 and weight 1, and two pixels with value 6 and weight 2, they are considered to be tied. You can use this control type to control whether M_TIE_BREAKER_MODE breaks the tie by comparing the actual pixel values (by comparing 5 to 6) or by comparing their non-weighted frequencies (by comparing four pixels present to two pixels present). M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to choose the value with which to replace the central pixel by comparing the values present in the neighborhood. M_ENABLE Specifies to choose the value with which to replace the central pixel by comparing the non-weighted frequency at which the values are found in the neighborhood. M_USE_IGNORED_VALUE Sets whether MIL should ignore the value in the source image set by M_IGNORED_VALUE when calling MimFilterMajority(). M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies not to ignore any value when calling MimFilterMajority(). M_ENABLE Specifies to ignore the pixels in the source image whose values match the ignored value when calling MimFilterMajority(). M_WEIGHT_IMAGE Sets the identifier of an image buffer, allocated using MbufAlloc2d(), that defines the neighborhood. When you pass a custom majority filter image processing context to MimFilterMajority(), this is how you define the neighborhood and, optionally, specify different weights, instead of passing a structuring element to the function. This allows you to save the weights with the context when calling MimSave() or MimStream(). The shape and size of the neighborhood will match that of the weight image. For example, if you want a rectangular 3x3 neighborhood, you should set the width and height of the buffer to 3 pixels when allocating it. If you load non-uniform pixel values into this buffer, certain neighborhood pixels will have more influence during the majority filter operation. For example, if you set the central pixel's value to 2, and all others to 1, then the central pixel's value will be counted twice during the majority filter operation. You can use MbufPut2d() to populate your weight image buffer with pixel weights. Weight image buffer identifier Specifies the identifier of the weight image buffer that you have previously allocated, using MbufAlloc2d(). Note that floating-point image buffers are not permitted. Additionally, if your weight image buffer is associated with a region of interest, it will cause an error. Find orientation image processing context ID Specifies a find orientation image processing context identifier, allocated using MimAlloc() with M_FIND_ORIENTATION_CONTEXT, and used in MimFindOrientation() operations. M_BORDER_ATTENUATION Sets whether MimFindOrientation() must process the image's borders, or if the operation can ignore spatial patterns occurring close to the ends of the image buffer. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ENABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that MimFindOrientation() cannot ignore the image's borders. The find orientation operation will use the borders. M_ENABLE Specifies that MimFindOrientation() can ignore the image's borders. The find orientation operation will not necessarily use the borders. M_FREQUENCY_CUTOFF_RATIO_HIGH Specifies the upper limit of frequencies in which to look for dominant orientations, as a percentage of the maximum frequency; the maximum frequency is dictated by the size of the image. Larger images will have higher maximum frequencies. Frequencies higher than this percentage will be ignored during computation. This can be useful for discarding noise in the image. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 95%. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the upper limit of frequencies in which to look for dominant orientations, as a percentage of the maximum frequency. For example, by specifying 95% (the default), frequencies above MaxFrequency x 95% will be ignored. M_FREQUENCY_CUTOFF_RATIO_LOW Specifies the lower limit of frequencies in which to look for dominant orientations, as a percentage of the maximum frequency; the maximum frequency is dictated by the size of the image. Larger images will have higher maximum frequencies. Frequencies lower than this percentage will be ignored during computation. This can be useful for discarding noise in the image. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 5%. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the lower limit of frequencies in which to look for dominant orientations, as a percentage of the maximum frequency. For example, by specifying 5% (the default), frequencies below MaxFrequency x 5% will be ignored. M_INTERPOLATION_MODE Sets the interpolation mode used to internally resize the source image if it is of an inappropriate size. This will only be used if the source image has dimensions that are not a power of 2 (X-size and Y-size). Note that you cannot set an interpolation mode if you are using M_CLIP_CENTER. M_DEFAULT Same as M_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR. M_AVERAGE Specifies averaging interpolation. The M_MODE control type must be set to M_RESIZE_DOWN. M_BICUBIC Specifies bicubic interpolation. The new value is determined by taking a weighted average of the 16 values (4x4) that surround the source point. Note that the sum of the weights used for bicubic interpolation might be greater than one. If this occurs and the result reflects an overflow or underflow, the result is saturated according to the depth and data type of the destination buffer. M_BILINEAR Specifies bilinear interpolation. The new value is determined by taking a weighted average of the 4 values (2x2) that surround the source point. M_INTERPOLATE Specifies interpolated resizing. For resizing up, this is equivalent to bilinear; for resizing down, this is equivalent to averaging. This gives the best speed/result compromise for interpolated resizing. M_MAX Specifies an interpolation based on the maximum pixel value in the source image area. The M_MODE control type must be set to M_RESIZE_DOWN. Note that this can alter the shapes of objects and reduce the robustness of the operation. M_MIN Specifies an interpolation based on the minimum pixel value in the source image area. The M_MODE control type must be set to M_RESIZE_DOWN. Note that this can alter the shapes of objects and reduce the robustness of the operation. M_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR Specifies nearest neighbor interpolation. The new value is that of the pixel closest to the source point. M_MODE Sets the resizing mode used if the source image is of an inappropriate size. Resizing will only occur if the source image has dimensions that are not a power of 2 (X-size and Y-size). The find orientation operation is then performed on the resized image, which is stored in a temporary image buffer. The original image is not altered. For more information on resizing, see the Basic geometric transforms section of Chapter 3: Fundamental image processing. M_DEFAULT Same as M_CLIP_CENTER. M_CLIP_CENTER Specifies to perform the find orientation operation using the largest centered portion of the image with dimensions that are a power of 2 (X-size and Y-size). M_RESIZE_DOWN Specifies to perform the find orientation operation on a subsampled version of the image with the closest possible dimensions that are a power of 2 (X-size and Y-size). M_RESIZE_UP Specifies to perform the find orientation operation on a zoomed version of the image with the closest possible dimensions that are a power of 2 (X-size and Y-size). Flat-field image processing context ID Specifies a flat-field image processing context, allocated using MimAlloc() with M_FLAT_FIELD_CONTEXT, and used in MimFlatField() operations. M_DARK_CONST Sets the dark constant value. This is used to remove thermal agitation recorded in the grabbed image (from the CCD) or to remove the darkest possible shade of black when removing uneven lighting from grabbed images. Note that M_DARK_CONST and M_DARK_IMAGE both cannot be set in the same flat-field image processing context. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 65535 Specifies the constant. M_DARK_IMAGE Sets the identifier of the dark image. This is used to remove thermal agitation recorded in the grabbed image (from the CCD) or to remove the dark shadows from the source image when removing uneven lighting from grabbed images. Note that, this image should be a uniformly dark area (such as, grabbing with the lens cap on your camera). Note that M_DARK_CONST and M_DARK_IMAGE both cannot be set in the same flat-field image processing context. DarkImageId Specifies the identifier of the image buffer. This image buffer must be an 8- or 16-bit unsigned processing image buffer. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. M_FLAT_CONST Sets the flat constant value. This is used to remove the variations of CCD sensitivity recorded in the grabbed image (from the CCD) or to reduce the gray in the grabbed image when removing uneven lighting. Note that M_FLAT_CONST and M_FLAT_IMAGE both cannot be set in the same flat-field image processing context. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 65535 Specifies the constant. M_FLAT_IMAGE Sets the identifier of the flat image. This is used to remove the variations of CCD sensitivity recorded in the grabbed image (from the CCD) or to reduce the gray in the grabbed image when removing uneven lighting. Note that, this image should be a uniform light gray area. When dealing with CCD sensitivity, the exposure time should be relatively short. Alternatively, when dealing with uneven lighting, the exposure time should be set so that no pixel is saturated. Note that M_FLAT_CONST and M_FLAT_IMAGE both cannot be set in the same flat-field image processing context. FlatImageId Specifies the identifier of the image buffer. This image buffer must be an 8- or 16-bit unsigned processing buffer. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. M_GAIN_CONST Sets the gain factor used to normalize (or scale) the result of the flat field calculation back to the full dynamic range of the destination image. M_AUTOMATIC Specifies an automatic gain factor. The automatically generated gain factor is determined by subtracting the flat image (M_FLAT_IMAGE) from the offset image (M_OFFSET_IMAGE) and then taking the average of the resulting image's pixels. If a constant value is specified instead of images (by using M_FLAT_CONST and M_OFFSET_CONST), MIL returns the result of the subtraction instead. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the gain factor. M_OFFSET_CONST Sets the offset constant value. This is used to remove the electrical bias recorded in the grabbed image (from the CCD) or to reduce the black in the flat image when removing uneven lighting. Note that M_OFFSET_CONST and M_OFFSET_IMAGE both cannot be set in the same flat-field image processing context. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 65535 Specifies the constant. M_OFFSET_IMAGE Sets the identifier of the offset image. This is used to remove the electrical bias recorded in the image (from the CCD) or to reduce the black in the flat image when removing uneven lighting. Note that, this image should be a uniform dark area. When dealing with electrical bias, the exposure time should be relatively short. Alternatively, when dealing with uneven lighting, the exposure time should be the same as for the flat image (that is, so that no pixel is saturated). Note that M_OFFSET_CONST and M_OFFSET_IMAGE both cannot be set in the same flat-field image processing context. OffsetImageId Specifies the identifier of the image buffer. This image buffer must be an 8- or 16-bit unsigned processing buffer. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Histogram equalization adaptive context ID Specifies a histogram equalization adaptive context, allocated using MimAlloc() with M_HISTOGRAM_EQUALIZE_ADAPTIVE_CONTEXT, and used in MimHistogramEqualizeAdaptive() operations. M_ALPHA_VALUE Sets the adjustment factor for M_EXPONENTIAL and M_RAYLEIGH operations. For other operations, M_ALPHA_VALUE is ignored. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.4. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the adjustment factor. For an M_EXPONENTIAL operation, greater adjustment values result in less occurrences of the most frequent pixels of the histogram in the resulting image buffer. For an M_RAYLEIGH operation, greater adjustment values result in greater occurrences of the most frequent pixels of the histogram in the resulting image buffer. M_CLIP_LIMIT Sets the maximum percentage of values that a tile's histogram bin can represent. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1%. 0.0 &lt; Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the maximum percentage. For example, if a tile has 100 pixels and you specify a maximum limit of 10%, there can be no bin in that tile's histogram with more than 10 values. This essentially limits the contrast. Exceeding values are distributed evenly among the tile's other histogram bins. M_HIST_SIZE Sets the number of bins for each tile's histogram. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ACCORDING_TO_SOURCE. M_ACCORDING_TO_SOURCE Specifies that MimHistogramEqualizeAdaptive() automatically determines the number of bins for each tile's histogram, according to the number of intensities that are possible in the specified image buffer. For example, if you specify an 8-bit unsigned buffer, each tile's histogram will have 256 bins. Value &gt;= 2 Specifies the number of bins for each tile's histogram. Only integer values accepted. M_NUMBER_OF_TILES_X Sets the number of tiles along the X-direction of the source image specified with MimHistogramEqualizeAdaptive(). Given the number of tiles in the X- and Y-direction, the size of the source image, and the requirement that tiles be congruent rectangles, MimHistogramEqualizeAdaptive() is able to establish the size of the tiles with which to process the image. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 8. Value &gt;= 2 Specifies the number of tiles. Only integer values accepted. M_NUMBER_OF_TILES_Y Sets the number of tiles along the Y-direction of the source image specified with MimHistogramEqualizeAdaptive(). Given the number of tiles in the Y- and X-direction, the size of the source image, and the requirement that tiles be congruent rectangles, MimHistogramEqualizeAdaptive() is able to establish the size of the tiles with which to process the image. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 8. Value &gt;= 2 Specifies the number of tiles. Only integer values accepted. M_OPERATION Sets the equalization operation that MimHistogramEqualizeAdaptive() uses. The cumulative probability distribution, Pf(f), of the input image is approximated by its cumulative histogram: For more information, refer to \"Pratt, William K. Digital Image Processing . United States: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1978. 318.\". M_DEFAULT Same as M_UNIFORM. M_EXPONENTIAL Specifies an equalization density function which generates an Exponential distribution. Output probability density model: Transfer function: M_HYPER_CUBE_ROOT Specifies an equalization density function which generates a Hyperbolic Cube Root distribution.

Output probability density model: Transfer function: M_RAYLEIGH Specifies an equalization density function which generates a Rayleigh distribution. Output probability density model: Transfer function: M_UNIFORM Specifies an equalization density function which generates a Uniform distribution. Output probability density model: Transfer function: Intensity histogram image processing result ID Specifies an intensity histogram image processing result buffer, allocated using MimAllocResult() with M_HIST_LIST, and used in MimHistogram() operations. M_HIST_BIN_SIZE_MODE Sets the number of values each histogram bin can represent. To specify the number of histogram bins in the result, use MimAllocResult() and the NbEntries parameter. For example, if you are using an 8-bit unsigned source image, and you want to have one bin for every possible intensity value, you should set the NbEntries parameter to 256. M_DEFAULT Same as M_REGULAR. M_FIT_SRC_DATA Specifies that MimHistogram() determines the resulting bin size according to the source image's minimum and maximum intensity values, and the total number of bins. For example, if you call MimHistogram() with a 16-bit signed buffer that holds a source image with a minimum pixel intensity value of 10 and a maximum of 1009, the histogram's bins must account for values between 10 and 1009, which is a total of 1000 possible values. In this case, if the histogram has 100 bins, each bin can represent 10 values (1000/100). M_FIT_SRC_RANGE Specifies that MimHistogram() determines the resulting bin size according to the full range of possible values in the source buffer, and the total number of bins. For example, if you call MimHistogram() with a 16-bit signed buffer, the histogram's bins must account for intensity values ranging from -32768 to 32767, which is a total of 65536 possible values. In this case, if the histogram has 512 bins, each bin can represent 128 values (65536/512). Note that the minimum and maximum values possible for a buffer can be modified using MbufControl() with M_MIN and M_MAX. M_FREEDMAN Specifies that MimHistogram() determines the resulting bin size according to the FreedmanDiaconis rule. This is a statistical estimate based on an equation of the general form: BinSize=2I Q R(x)n -1/3 . For more information, see \"Freedman, David; Diaconis, Persi. On the histogram as a density estimator . Heidelberg, Berlin: Springer, 1981. \". M_REGULAR Specifies that each histogram bin can hold 1 value. M_HIST_SMOOTHING_ITERATIONS Sets the number of smoothing iterations to perform on the histogram after it has been generated. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the number of smoothing iterations. Only integer values accepted. The smoothing applied is an integer-based averaging of the histogram; the resulting number of values might therefore be different than the number of values in the source image. Linear IIR filter image processing context ID Specifies a linear IIR filter image processing context, allocated using MimAlloc() with M_LINEAR_FILTER_IIR_CONTEXT, and used in MimConvolve() and MimDifferential() operations. M_FILTER_OPERATION Sets the linear filter operation to perform. For all derivatives, the result is signed. The destination buffer should be a signed or floating-point buffer (even if an error is not returned). The result of a derivative in an unsigned buffer will wrap around negative numbers. In all cases, if a result does not fit in the buffer, the least-significant n-bits of the result will be written to the destination buffer. M_DEFAULT Same as M_SMOOTH. M_FIRST_DERIVATIVE_X Specifies to compute the first derivative of the image, with respect to X, using the specified filter type. M_FIRST_DERIVATIVE_Y Specifies to compute the first derivative of the image, with respect to Y, using the specified filter type. M_SECOND_DERIVATIVE_X Specifies to compute the second derivative of the image, with respect to X, using the specified filter type. M_SECOND_DERIVATIVE_XY Specifies to compute the second derivative of the image, with respect to X and Y, using the specified filter type. M_SECOND_DERIVATIVE_Y Specifies to compute the second derivative of the image, with respect to Y, using the specified filter type. M_SMOOTH Performs a smoothing operation on the image using the specified filter type. M_FILTER_RESPONSE_TYPE Sets the filter response type. In all cases, if a result does not fit in the buffer, the least-significant n-bits of the result will be written to the destination buffer. M_DEFAULT Same as M_SLOPE. M_SLOPE Specifies a response that is normalized according to the input slope. With this setting, the filter response is consistent with the local slope of the input signal; that is, the rate of change of local intensity values in the input image is in line with the filter response. Any derivative operations performed maintain this consistency. For example, if using a first derivative operation, the response to a ramp input will be its slope. For derivative operations, a floating-point buffer should be used since the result is not remapped and theoretically the result could be an infinite slope. Note that saturation can occur with this setting. M_STEP Specifies a response that is normalized according to a step input. When M_FILTER_STEP_RESPONSE_MAPPING is set to M_ACCORDING_TO_DEST, the response is adjusted so that saturation will not occur; that is, the maximum filter response is set according to the depth of the destination image buffer so that the destination image buffer can hold value extremes without saturation. For derivative operations, the result will be mapped to fit in a signed buffer with the same size as the source. The result is mapped between min +1 and max. For example, for an 8-bit buffer, the result will be mapped between -127 and 127. M_FILTER_SMOOTHNESS Specifies the degree of smoothness (strength of the denoising) to apply, according to the filter smoothness type. Larger values result in greater smoothing. M_DEFAULT Specifies a default smoothness value that is mid-range. For an M_NORMALIZED filter smoothness type, the value is 50. For an M_SIZE or M_NATIVE filter smoothness type, the default value results in smoothing that is approximately equivalent to setting M_NORMALIZED to 50. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the smoothness value. The range available depends on the smoothness type. For an M_NORMALIZED type, the range is 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100. For an M_NATIVE type, the range is 0 &lt; Value &lt; 1. For an M_SIZE type, the value entered reflects the extent to which neighboring pixels affect the central pixel of the region receiving the filter. A size of 10, for example, is roughly equivalent to a 21 x 21 convolution kernel, where the 10 pixels on each side of the central pixel will have an impact on the filter operation. M_FILTER_SMOOTHNESS_TYPE Specifies the filter smoothness type. M_DEFAULT Same as M_NORMALIZED. M_NATIVE Specifies to control the alpha (), beta (), or sigma () value in the Deriche, Shen-Castan, or Vliet weighting function, depending on the filter type specified with M_FILTER_TYPE. Whereas the M_NORMALIZED and M_SIZE filter smoothness type settings reorganize the data to provide a more intuitive approach (such as the 0-100 range of M_NORMALIZED), this setting makes no such transformation and allows you to control the raw (native) smoothness directly. This is an advanced setting, and requires knowledge of the Deriche, Shen-Castan, or Vliet filter formulas. Set the required alpha (), beta (), or sigma () value with M_FILTER_SMOOTHNESS. M_NORMALIZED Specifies to use a normalized smoothness value that is between 0 and 100. M_SIZE Specifies to use a smoothness value driven by a spatial size. This size specifies the extent (similar to a kernel width) to which neighboring pixels affect the central pixel of the region receiving the filter. M_FILTER_STEP_RESPONSE_MAPPING Sets how to remap a derivative result. Note that smoothing operations (M_FILTER_OPERATION with M_SMOOTH) are not remapped. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ACCORDING_TO_SOURCE. M_ACCORDING_TO_DEST Specifies to remap to the range of the destination buffer. When using this setting, the source and destination buffers cannot be floating-point buffers. Additionally, the destination must be a signed buffer. M_ACCORDING_TO_SOURCE Specifies to remap to a signed (floating-point) result that has the same bit-depth as the source buffer. For example, for an 8-bit unsigned buffer, the result will be mapped between -127 and 127. M_FILTER_TYPE Specifies the type of IIR filter to use for the convolution operation. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DERICHE. M_DERICHE Specifies a Deriche infinite support filter. M_DERICHE implements an approximation of the Gaussian filter using an IIR weighted exponential function, of which the general form is: For the Deriche filter, the neighborhoods' influence decreases much slower as the distance from the central pixel increases, compared to the Shen-Castan filter. M_SHEN Specifies a Shen-Castan infinite support exponential filter. This is an exponential weighting function, of the general form: For the Shen-Castan filter, the neighborhoods' influence decreases much faster as the distance from the central pixel increases, compared to the Deriche filter. M_VLIET Specifies a Vliet infinite support filter. This is an approximation of the Gaussian function, which has the general form: The Vliet filter is an accurate approximation of the Gaussian function, especially when sigma () is large.

M_FRAME_SIZE Sets the Y-size of the frames. The Y-size must be set before preprocessing the context. M_FRAME_SIZE will always be the Y-size, regardless of the direction set with M_SCAN_LANE_DIRECTION. If a multi-frame image buffer is used, M_FRAME_SIZE sets the Y-size of each individual frame. M_DEFAULT Same as M_FULL_SIZE. M_FULL_SIZE Specifies to use the buffer as a single frame. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the Y-size of the frames. M_MINIMUM_CONTRAST Sets the minimum contrast (difference) between the intensity of the local 1D background and the minimum acceptable intensity of a pixel in the peak neighborhood. This control type is intended to adjust how M3dmapAddScan() internally processes laser line images. When using MimLocatePeak1d(), you typically set the value using the function's parameters; this control type only sets the default value used by the function. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 100. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 255 Specifies the minimum contrast. M_NUMBER_OF_FRAMES Sets the total number of frames for which peaks can be extracted. This is the maximum number of frames for which results can be accumulated. The number of frames must be set before preprocessing the context. Note that when passing a multi-frame image buffer to MimLocatePeak1d(), the number of frames processed by each call to MimLocatePeak1d() can be different from M_NUMBER_OF_FRAMES. If M_NUMBER_OF_FRAMES is set to 10, and a 5-frame source image buffer is passed, you can call MimLocatePeak1d() 2 times to process the total number of frames. Note that, in this example case, the 2 calls need not be successive. You can retrieve results using MimGetResultSingle() at any time after a MimLocatePeak1d() operation. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the number of frames. M_NUMBER_OF_PEAKS Sets the maximum number of peaks to find along a given lane.

This control type is intended to adjust how M3dmapAddScan() internally processes laser line images. When using MimLocatePeak1d(), you typically set the value using the function's parameters; this control type only sets the default value used by the function. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 20. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the number of pixels. M_PEAK_WIDTH_NOMINAL Sets the nominal (expected average) width of the peak neighborhood. In laser line images, this is the average width of the laser line. This control type is intended to adjust how M3dmapAddScan() internally processes laser line images. When using MimLocatePeak1d(), you typically set the value using the function's parameters; this control type only sets the default value used by the function. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 20. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the number of pixels. M_SCAN_LANE_DIRECTION Sets the direction in which to detect peaks. M_DEFAULT Same as M_VERTICAL. M_HORIZONTAL Detects peaks along the image's X-axis. Typically for laser line images with a vertical laser line. M_VERTICAL Detects peaks along the image's Y-axis. Typically for laser line images with a horizontal laser line. Locate peak 1D image processing result ID Specifies a locate peak 1D image processing result buffer, allocated using MimAllocResult() with M_LOCATE_PEAK_1D_RESULT, and used in MimLocatePeak1d() operations. M_PEAK_INTENSITY_INVALID_VALUE Sets the intensity value to use for missing peaks. M_DEFAULT Same as M_INVALID. M_INVALID Specifies the value -1. This is adequate for most applications. Value Specifies any integer value, for applications with specific needs. 0 is a common choice in this case. M_SORT_CRITERION Sets the characteristic with which to sort peaks. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default; the default is M_PEAK_INTENSITY + M_SORT_DOWN. Note that M_SORT_DOWN is not the default sort order when explicitly specifying the sort criterion.

Match image processing context ID Specifies a match image processing context, allocated using MimAlloc() with M_MATCH_CONTEXT, and used in MimMatch() operations. M_MASK_IMAGE Sets the image buffer containing the mask image. All non-zero values are considered masked pixels that will be ignored during the match. MaskImageId Specifies the identifier of the image buffer containing the mask image. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. M_MAX_SCORE Sets the maximum score when performing a match using the normalized grayscale correlation mode. When using other matching modes, this control type is ignored. This control type causes MIL to linearly remap the range of the internal match results to the range established, from the lowest possible value to the maximum score specified. M_DEFAULT Same as M_MAX_DEPTH. M_MAX_DEPTH Specifies to establish the maximum score based on the pixel depth of the destination buffer (for example, when dealing with a 16-bit signed buffer, the maximum value would be 32, 767). Note that, when using floating-point destination buffers, the range is [-1, 1]; unless you use a clipping score type (using M_SCORE_TYPE set to either M_NORM_CLIP or M_NORM_CLIP_SQR), in which case the range is [0, 1].

M_DEFAULT Same as 1. 1 Specifies to take every pixel (on both axes) to compute the match. 2 Specifies to take every other pixel (on both axes) to compute the match. M_SCORE_TYPE Sets how to compute the final correlation score. Note that this control type is only used when performing a match using normalized grayscale correlation mode (using M_MODE set to M_CORRELATE_NORMALIZED). M_DEFAULT Same as M_NORM_CLIP_SQR. M_NORM Specifies to use normalized grayscale correlation to compute the final match score.

The calculation used is the same as M_NORM, but any value less than 0 is clipped (that is, recorded as 0). M_NORM_CLIP_SQR Specifies to clip the results from the square of the normalized grayscale correlation when computing the final correlation score. The calculation used is the same as M_SQR_NORM, but any value less than 0 is clipped (that is, recorded as 0).

M_USE_CONTEXT Specifies to use the context's destination start and end values specified with M_DST_START_VALUE and M_DST_END_VALUE. M_DST_START_VALUE Sets the start pixel value used to compute the destination range. Note, this is only used when M_DST_RANGE is set to M_USE_CONTEXT. When calling MimRemap(), if the value falls outside the range of the destination buffer, it will be saturated. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0.

M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1. Value Specifies the displacement in X. M_GLCM_PAIR_OFFSET_Y Sets the displacement in Y between pixel pairs used to generate the co-occurrence matrix.

M_DISABLE Specifies not to perform this statistical operation. M_ENABLE Specifies to perform this statistical operation. M_STAT_ANGULAR_DATA_MEAN Sets whether to calculate the dominant direction of the unit vectors. This angle is a representation of the mean (or average) angle of all the angular data. Note that to obtain more representative results, the mean angle should be analyzed in context with the coherence. For example, if your image has a coherence of 0.1 and a mean angle of 65°, the mean angle is not very meaningful because the unit vectors are pointing in random, incoherent directions. However, if your image has a coherence of 0.9 and a mean angle of 65°, this indicates that the unit vectors are more or less pointing in the same direction and their average value is around 65°. M_DISABLE Specifies not to perform this statistical operation. M_ENABLE Specifies to perform this statistical operation. M_STAT_GLCM_CONTRAST Sets whether to calculate the contrast of all the grayscale pixel values within a specified neighborhood in relation to the normalized co-occurrence probability of each pixel.

Note that the image on which the calculation is performed must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. M_DISABLE Specifies not to perform this statistical operation. M_ENABLE Specifies to perform this statistical operation. M_STAT_GLCM_ENTROPY Sets whether to calculate the inverse of the energy between two points in the normalized co-occurrence probability of a specified neighborhood. Define the neighborhood using M_GLCM_PAIR_OFFSET_X, M_GLCM_PAIR_OFFSET_Y, M_GLCM_QUANTIFICATION, M_TILE_SIZE_X, and M_TILE_SIZE_Y.

M_DISABLE Specifies not to perform this statistical operation. M_ENABLE Specifies to perform this statistical operation. M_STAT_GLCM_HOMOGENEITY Sets whether to calculate the similarity between the normalized co-occurrence probability and the gray level co-occurrence matrix of a given neighborhood. Homogeneity weighs values by the inverse of the contrast weight, with weights decreasing exponentially away from the diagonal. Define the neighborhood using M_GLCM_PAIR_OFFSET_X, M_GLCM_PAIR_OFFSET_Y, M_GLCM_QUANTIFICATION, M_TILE_SIZE_X, and M_TILE_SIZE_Y. Note that the image on which the calculation is performed must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error.

The coherence represents the directional trend of all the orientation data in the image and is a measure of how coherent or parallel the orientation of the unit vectors are with respect to each other. The coherence is calculated as the ratio between the length (norm) of the vector sum and its maximum possible length (which corresponds to the number of pixels being considered, since each pixel is presumed to have a length of one). Numerically, this quantity lies between 0 and 1, where 0 represents absolutely no coherence (unit vectors pointing in random directions) and 1 is total coherence (unit vectors pointing in same direction). M_DISABLE Specifies not to perform this statistical operation. M_ENABLE Specifies to perform this statistical operation. M_STAT_ORIENTATION_DATA_MEAN Sets whether to calculate the dominant orientation of the unit vectors. The orientation of a unit vector is its inclination, without its direction; if two unit vectors have opposite directions (for example, an angle of 0° and 180°), they have the same orientation (0°). Calculating the dominant orientation using unit vectors with opposite directions (0° and 180°) would result in the magnitude of their vector sum being double the original value (2) and a dominant orientation of 0°. Whereas, calculating the dominant orientation using two unit vectors that are separated by 90° (for example, an angle of 0° and 90°) would result in the magnitude of their vector sum being 0, effectively canceling each other out (no dominant orientation), and an invalid orientation angle.

Wavelet image processing context ID Specifies a wavelet image processing context, allocated using MimAlloc() with M_WAVELET_TRANSFORM_CONTEXT or M_WAVELET_TRANSFORM_CUSTOM_CONTEXT, and used in MimWaveletTransform() or MimWaveletDenoise() operations. Unless otherwise specified, settings apply to both M_WAVELET_TRANSFORM_CONTEXT and M_WAVELET_TRANSFORM_CUSTOM_CONTEXT context types. M_TRANSFORMATION_MODE Sets the wavelet transformation mode. Modifying the transformation mode can affect how MIL samples the data and produces the wavelet results (for example, the diagonal, horizontal, and vertical coefficients). M_DEFAULT Same as M_DYADIC. M_DYADIC Specifies a dyadic wavelet transformation. For each transformation level, MIL samples the wavelet coefficients by a factor of 2. For example, when drawing dyadic results, they are at different sizes, at different levels. Dyadic transformations generally apply to signal coding and data compression. Performing MimWaveletDenoise() with M_DYADIC is typically faster than M_UNDECIMATED, though the quality of denoising is usually lower. In general, M_DYADIC uses less resources (processing time and memory) than M_UNDECIMATED. M_UNDECIMATED Specifies an undecimated wavelet transformation. Such transformations are designed to overcome the lack of invariance between transformation levels in dyadic wavelet transformations. For example, when drawing undecimated results, they are at the same size regardless of the level. Undecimated transformations generally apply to signal denoising and pattern recognition. Performing MimWaveletDenoise() with M_UNDECIMATED is typically slower than M_DYADIC, though the quality of denoising is usually higher. In general, M_UNDECIMATED uses more resources (processing time and memory) than M_DYADIC. M_WAVELET_TYPE Sets a predefined type of wavelet filter. Only available if the context type is M_WAVELET_TRANSFORM_CONTEXT. The mathematical domain of complex filter types (M_..._COMPLEX) consists of numbers that have a real part (real numbers) and an imaginary part (imaginary numbers). The mathematical domain of filter types that are not complex consist of real numbers only. M_DEFAULT Same as M_HAAR.

Syntax void MimConvert( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;ArrayBufIdOrConversionType //in ) Description This function performs a color conversion on the source image and places the result in the destination buffer. If necessary, you can perform a mathematically optimal color-to-grayscale conversion using McolProject() with M_PRINCIPAL_COMPONENT_PROJECTION. When converting from sRGB (M_SRGB_...), your color data must adhere to standard RGB specifications (sRGB), as defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Project Team 61966-2-1. Conversions to sRGB (M_...SRGB) will also adhere to these standards. If converting from linear sRGB (M_SRGB_LINEAR_...), your color data must not be corrected (gamma corrected). Conversions to linear sRGB (M_...SRGB_LINEAR) will also not be corrected. Parameters Parameters SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source image buffer. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Source buffer values must typically be positive, including the values in a signed source buffer. For LAB and LCH conversions, the full range of integer buffers is taken into account, including the negative values of signed buffers. If specifying a floating-point buffer, the values of the buffer must be normalized between 0 and 1 before calling this function. DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. The values generated will typically be normalized to the possible range of values in the destination buffer. For example, the hue values from 0 to 360° will generate the values from 0 to 255 in an 8-bit destination buffer. For a floating-point destination buffer, the values generated will typically be normalized between 0 and 1. This normalization does not apply to the MIL array buffer identifier conversion type. For LAB conversions with a floating-point destination buffer, the L band values fall between 0 and 100 (inclusive), while the A and B band values are unbounded. However for most applications, A and B values fall between -150 and 150 (exclusive). When converting to LAB with an integer destination buffer, A and B values are saturated to fall within -128 and 127 (inclusive). MIL then scales the L, A, and B band values to fall within the range of the destination buffer. The L band is therefore subject to a larger scaling than the two other bands. For LCH conversions with a floating-point destination buffer, the H band value is an angle, in degrees; otherwise, MIL rescales the angle to fall within the range of the destination buffer. When converting to LCH with an integer destination buffer, MIL clips the C value to the lower value between the maximum allowed in the destination buffer and 255. MIL then rescales the value to fit within the full range of the destination buffer. ArrayBufIdOrConversionType Specifies the type of conversion to perform. The conversion can be specified with either a predefined or custom transformation matrix. This parameter can be set to one of the following. For specifying the type of conversion to perform Value Description MIL system-specifictooltip () M_HSL_TO_RGB Specifies an HSL to RGB conversion. Both the source and destination image buffers must be 3-band image buffers.  M_HSV_TO_RGB Specifies an HSV to RGB conversion. Both the source and destination image buffers must be 3-band image buffers.  M_LAB_TO_SRGB Specifies a LAB (CIELAB) to sRGB conversion. The LAB color space is based on the color's luminance (L), its position between red and green (A), and its position between yellow and blue (B). Both the source and destination image buffers must be 3-band image buffers.  M_LAB_TO_SRGB_LINEAR Specifies a LAB (CIELAB) to linear sRGB conversion. The LAB color space is based on the color's luminance (L), its position between red and green (A), and its position between yellow and blue (B). Both the source and destination image buffers must be 3-band image buffers.  M_L_TO_RGB Specifies an L (luminance) to RGB conversion. The luminance (intensity) is repeated in each color band of the destination buffer, creating a monochromatic (gray) RGB buffer. The source buffer must be a 1-band image buffer and the destination buffer must be a 3-band image buffer.  M_LCH_TO_SRGB Specifies an LCH to sRGB conversion. The LCH color space is similar to the LAB color space, with an emphasis on polar coordinates (absolute black and absolute white). LCH is based on luminance (L), chroma (C), and hue (H). Both the source and destination image buffers must be 3-band image buffers.  M_LCH_TO_SRGB_LINEAR Specifies an LCH to linear sRGB conversion. The LCH color space is similar to the LAB color space, with an emphasis on polar coordinates (absolute black and absolute white). LCH is based on luminance (L), chroma (C), and hue (H). Both the source and destination image buffers must be 3-band image buffers.  M_RGB_NORMALIZE Specifies an RGB-to-normalized-RGB conversion. Each component of every pixel is scaled to a value between 0 and 1(inclusive), for example, the normalized R component is calculated according to R_Normalized = R / (R + G + B). To do so, the sum of the RGB components of each pixel is computed, and then, each component for that pixel is divided by that sum. If the destination buffer is an integer buffer, this value is then rescaled between 0 and the depth of the buffer. Both the source and destination image buffers must be 3-band image buffers. This normalizing of the RGB color space can help remove unwanted variations in shades from an image.  M_RGB_TO_H Specifies an RGB to H conversion, where H represents the hue of the HSL color space. The source image must be a 3-band image buffer and the destination buffer must be a 1-band image buffer.  M_RGB_TO_HSL Specifies an RGB to HSL (hue, luminance (intensity), and saturation) conversion. Both the source and destination image buffers must be 3-band image buffers. The hue component (H) is stored in band 0, the luminance component (L) is stored in band 2, and the saturation component (S) is stored in band 1.  M_RGB_TO_HSV Specifies an RGB to HSV (hue, saturation, and value) conversion. Both the source and destination image buffers must be 3-band image buffers.  M_RGB_TO_L Specifies an RGB to L conversion, where L represents the luminance (intensity) of the HSL color space. The source image must be a 3-band image buffer and the destination buffer must be a 1-band image buffer. Note that M_RGB_TO_L and M_RGB_TO_Y produce similar results but not identical results because they are calculated to different color spaces.  M_RGB_TO_Y Specifies an RGB to Y conversion, where Y represents the luminance of the YUV color space. The source buffer must have 3 bands. The destination buffer can have 1 or 3 bands. If it has 3 bands, only the first band is overwritten. Note that M_RGB_TO_L and M_RGB_TO_Y produce similar results but not identical results because they are calculated to different color spaces.  M_SRGB_LINEAR_TO_LAB Specifies a linear sRGB to LAB (CIELAB) conversion. The LAB color space is based on the color's luminance (L), its position between red and green (A), and its position between yellow and blue (B). Both the source and destination image buffers must be 3-band image buffers.  M_SRGB_LINEAR_TO_LCH Specifies a linear sRGB to LCH conversion. The LCH color space is similar to the LAB color space, with an emphasis on polar coordinates (absolute black and absolute white). LCH is based on luminance (L), chroma (C), and hue (H). Both the source and destination image buffers must be 3-band image buffers.  M_SRGB_TO_LAB Specifies an sRGB to LAB (CIELAB) conversion. The LAB color space is based on the color's luminance (L), its position between red and green (A), and its position between yellow and blue (B). Both the source and destination image buffers must be 3-band image buffers.  M_SRGB_TO_LCH Specifies an sRGB to LCH conversion. The LCH color space is similar to the LAB color space, with an emphasis on polar coordinates (absolute black and absolute white). LCH is based on luminance (L), chroma (C), and hue (H). Both the source and destination image buffers must be 3-band image buffers.  MIL array buffer identifier Specifies a general matrix multiplication transform will be used to modify the source image's color information. The matrix multiplication is performed using the provided 1-band, 32-bit floating-point buffer allocated using MbufAlloc2d() with M_ARRAY. You should use MbufPut() to define the values of the matrix. The source image buffer must be a 3-band buffer. The computation is shown below. When the provided array buffer is a 3x3 matrix or a 4x3 matrix (with optional offset values), the destination should be a 3-band buffer. When the provided array buffer is a 3x1 matrix or a 4x1 matrix (with an optional offset value), the destination should be a 1-band buffer. The final values are clipped (saturated) according to the destination buffer's bit depth.  Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; milim.lib.

Syntax void MimConvolve( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;FilterContextImOrKernelBufId //in ) Description This function performs a general convolution operation on the source buffer using the specified filter, storing results in the specified destination buffer. This function supports two types of filters: Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters. FIR filters operate on a finite neighborhood, while IIR filters take into account all values in an image. You can specify either a predefined FIR filter or a custom FIR or IIR filter. Note that predefined FIR filters are the fastest type, and are recommended as the first to try if you are not sure which filter will best suit your needs. When using custom filters, relatively small FIR filters are faster and allow control over the kernel contents. If the FIR kernel that you require becomes too large, try an IIR filter. If speed is not an issue, try the adaptive filters available using MimFilterAdaptive(), which remove noise in an image while preserving edges as much as possible. This function provides a number of predefined FIR filters. For predefined FIR filters, the overscan is set to transparent overscan pixel values, saturation is enabled for results, and the kernel's default center pixel is set as the top-left pixel of the central elements in a neighborhood. When using predefined FIR filters, you cannot change operation control settings except for the overscan. This function also accepts a custom FIR or IIR filter with which you can customize operation control settings. To define a custom FIR filter, you must allocate a kernel buffer using MbufAlloc1d() or MbufAlloc2d(). Note that the kernel buffer size can be constrained by the available resources. To define a custom IIR filter, you must allocate a linear IIR filter image processing context, using MimAlloc() with M_LINEAR_FILTER_IIR_CONTEXT. To define a custom FIR filter, you must load the kernel buffer with values, using MbufPut(). When using a custom FIR filter, you can change operation control settings using MbufControl(). To define a custom IIR filter, use MimControl() with a linear IIR filter image processing context and specify appropriate M_FILTER_TYPE, M_FILTER_OPERATION, M_FILTER_RESPONSE_TYPE, M_FILTER_SMOOTHNESS_TYPE, and M_FILTER_SMOOTHNESS operation control type settings. For predefined and custom FIR filters, when using 32-bit integer buffers and saturation is disabled, the accumulator buffer is a 32-bit internal buffer (MIL_INT); whereas, when saturation is enabled, the accumulator buffer is a 64-bit floating-point internal buffer (double). For custom IIR filters, operations are always performed using floating-point precision. For custom FIR filters, this function will internally separate a large kernel into two 1-dimensional kernels, if possible, to increase the speed of the convolution operation. For more information on separating kernels, see the Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters subsection of the Custom spatial filters section of Chapter 4: Advanced image processing. Custom FIR filters containing a single kernel value (such as uniform kernels or average kernels) are dealt with by a specifically targeted algorithmic optimization. If the source and destination are multi-band buffers, the same filter is applied to every band of the source buffer. Parameters Parameters SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the data source of the operation. This parameter must be given an image buffer identifier. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. If performing an IIR derivative filter operation and M_FILTER_STEP_RESPONSE_MAPPING is set to M_ACCORDING_TO_DEST, the source buffer cannot be a floating-point buffer; otherwise, an error will be generated. Note that for an FIR filter, the size of the image buffer must be greater or equal to the size of the kernel. DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination of the results. This parameter must be given an image buffer identifier. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. If performing an IIR derivative filter operation, the destination buffer must be a signed or floating-point buffer. If M_FILTER_STEP_RESPONSE_MAPPING is set to M_ACCORDING_TO_DEST, the destination buffer is further restricted and cannot be a floating-point buffer; otherwise, an error will be generated. Note that for an FIR filter, the size of the image buffer must be greater or equal to the size of the kernel. FilterContextImOrKernelBufId Specifies the filter to use. Set this parameter to a predefined filter, the identifier of the kernel buffer which defines a custom FIR filter, or a linear IIR filter image processing context, which defines a custom IIR filter. To specify a custom filter, set this parameter to one of the following: For specifying a custom filter Value Description Kernel Buffer ID Specifies the identifier of the kernel buffer for a custom FIR filter, allocated using MbufAlloc...() with M_KERNEL. For more details, refer to the Custom spatial filters section of Chapter 4: Advanced image processing. Linear IIR filter image processing context ID Specifies a linear IIR filter image processing context for a custom IIR filter, allocated using MimAlloc() with M_LINEAR_FILTER_IIR_CONTEXT. Set up the context using MimControl(). To specify a predefined FIR filter, set this parameter to one of the following: For specifying a predefined FIR filter Value Description M_EDGE_DETECT_PREWITT_FAST Computes the gradient of the image using the following operation, which is based on a Prewitt filter. M_EDGE_DETECT_SOBEL_FAST Computes the gradient of the image using the following operation, which is based on a Sobel filter. M_HORIZONTAL_EDGE_PREWITT Computes the absolute values of the vertical derivative of the image using a Prewitt filter, to detect the horizontal edges. M_HORIZONTAL_EDGE_SOBEL Computes the absolute values of the vertical derivative of the image using a Sobel filter, to detect the horizontal edges. M_LAPLACIAN_4 Computes the Laplacian values of the image using the following 4-connected Laplacian edge detection filter. M_LAPLACIAN_8 Computes the Laplacian values of the image using the following 8-connected Laplacian edge detection filter. M_LAPLACIAN_ISO_8 Computes the Laplacian values of the image using the following 8-connected isotropic Laplacian edge detection filter. M_PREWITT_X Computes the values of the horizontal derivative of the image using a Prewitt filter. M_PREWITT_Y Computes the values of the vertical derivative of the image using a Prewitt filter. M_SHARPEN_4 Performs a sharpening operation on the image using the following 4-connected Laplacian filter combined with the original image. Note that this operation results in a sharpening effect that is not as strong as the one achieved with M_SHARPEN_8. M_SHARPEN_8 Performs a sharpening operation on the image using the following 8-connected Laplacian filter combined with the original image. Note that this operation results in a stronger sharpening effect than M_SHARPEN_4. M_SMOOTH Performs a smoothing operation on the image using the following smoothing filter. M_SOBEL_X Computes the values of the horizontal derivative of the image using a Sobel filter. M_SOBEL_Y Computes the values of the vertical derivative of the image using a Sobel filter. M_VERTICAL_EDGE_PREWITT Computes the absolute values of the horizontal derivative of the image using a Prewitt filter, to detect the vertical edges. M_VERTICAL_EDGE_SOBEL Computes the absolute values of the horizontal derivative of the image using a Sobel filter, to detect the vertical edges. Combination values for the values listed in For specifying a predefined FIR filter. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to specify how to determine the value of a destination pixel when its associated point falls outside the source buffer. For specifying how to determine the value of a destination pixel when its associated point falls outside the source buffer Combination value Description M_OVERSCAN_DISABLE Specifies to disable overscanning for this operation. You should disable overscanning to accelerate the operation for applications in which the overscan data is not important in the resulting buffer. M_OVERSCAN_ENABLE Specifies to enable overscanning for this operation. The overscan uses pixels from the ancestor of the source buffer. If the source buffer is not a child buffer, or if the point falls outside the ancestor buffer, a mirror type overscan is used. A mirror overscan specifies that the overscan pixels will be a mirror copy of the source buffer's border pixels. This is the default value. M_OVERSCAN_FAST Specifies that MIL will automatically select the overscan that optimizes speed, according to the specified operation and the target system. The overscan could be hardware-specific thereby having a different behavior than the other supported overscan modes. Note that when using M_OVERSCAN_FAST, the destination pixels in the overscan area are undefined. The pixels can therefore contain different values from one function call to the next, even if the function's parameter values are the same. Remark In-place processing is supported, but the source and destination image buffers cannot partially overlap (a situation that can only occur when using child buffers).

Src2ImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the second image data source. This parameter can only be given an image buffer identifier. The image buffer must be 1-band. If you specify an image buffer that has an ROI associated with it, the ROI must be in raster format; otherwise, you will get an error. CountResultImId Specifies the identifier of the buffer in which to store the differences. This parameter must be given the identifier of an image processing result buffer that was allocated with MimAllocResult() and has an M_COUNT_LIST type. The buffer needs only one entry. You can set this parameter to M_NULL, since the function also returns the number of differences between the two specified source buffers. Return value If CountResultImId is M_NULL, the returned value is the number of differences between the two specified source buffers. If CountResultImId is not M_NULL, the returned value is M_INVALID. In that case, use either MimGetResult1d() or MimGetResult(), with M_VALUE as the result type, to retrieve the number of differences. Compilation information Header Include mil.h.

Syntax void MimDeadPixelCorrection( MIL_ID&nbsp;DeadPixelContextImId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function corrects dead pixels in the specified source image and places the resulting image in the destination image buffer. Dead pixels are replaced with an average of their non-dead pixel neighbors. Other pixels are copied from the source image buffer into the destination image buffer. Before using this function, you must add the list of the coordinates of the dead pixels to the context, using MimPut() and two arrays (one for the X-coordinates and one for the Y-coordinates). Alternatively, you can add an image identifying the locations of the dead pixels to the context, using MimControl() with M_DEAD_PIXELS; this image acts as a dead pixel mask. In the dead pixel mask image, all non-zero pixels are considered dead pixels. Specify the interpolation mode using MimControl() with M_INTERPOLATION_MODE. By default, the interpolation mode is M_AVERAGE. The source and destination image buffers must be as large as (or larger than) the dead pixel mask, or equal to or larger than the largest specified coordinates of the dead pixels. Once the dead pixel correction image processing context is configured, preprocess the context by calling MimDeadPixelCorrection() with M_PREPROCESS. If the preprocess operation was not done explicitly (using M_PREPROCESS), it will be done when MimDeadPixelCorrection() is first called. When preprocessed explicitly, the source and destination image buffers can be set to M_NULL. If, however, the source or destination image buffer is provided, it will be used in the preprocess operation, to better optimize future calls. Parameters Parameters DeadPixelContextImId Specifies the identifier of the dead pixels image processing context. The context must have been allocated using MimAlloc() with M_DEAD_PIXEL_CONTEXT. In addition, the dead pixel image processing context must be already configured with the location of the dead pixels. SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source image buffer. The buffer must be a single-band image buffer. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. If performing a preprocess operation on the image processing context, set this parameter to the identifier of a typical source image buffer. Otherwise, to exclude this buffer from preprocessing, set this parameter to M_NULL. DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer. The buffer must be a single-band image buffer. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. If performing a preprocess operation on the image processing context, set this parameter to the identifier of a typical destination image buffer. Otherwise, to exclude this buffer from preprocessing, set this parameter to M_NULL. ControlFlag Specifies the control flag. This parameter must be set to one of the following: For preprocessing the dead pixel image processing context Value Description M_DEFAULT Corrects the dead pixels present in the source image. M_PREPROCESS Preprocesses the specified image processing context. Note that, if not called explicitly, this operation will be performed automatically upon the first call to MimDeadPixelCorrection(). If the identifier of the source and/or destination buffer is not set to M_NULL, information about the source and/or destination image buffer will be used in the preprocessing operation. Remark In-place processing is supported, but the source and destination image buffers cannot partially overlap (a situation that can only occur when using child buffers).

      "text": " MimDeinterlace Synopsis Produce a sequence of deinterlaced images from a sequence of images acquired from an interlaced camera. Syntax void MimDeinterlace( MIL_ID&nbsp;DeinterlaceContextImId, //in const MIL_ID&nbsp;*SrcImageArrayPtr, //in const MIL_ID&nbsp;*DstImageArrayPtr, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;SrcImageCount, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;DstImageCount, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function produces a sequence of deinterlaced images from a sequence of images grabbed from an interlaced camera. When an image is acquired using an interlaced camera, the even and odd fields are not taken at the exact same moment in time. If the object in the image was in motion, there is an offset between the position of the object in one field and its position in the other. Simply combining these two fields to produce a deinterlaced image results in noticeable deformities in moving objects, called interlacing artifacts. MimDeinterlace() uses averaging techniques to reduce or remove these interlacing artifacts and produce a higher quality deinterlaced image. To perform the deinterlacing operation, you can select one of several deinterlacing algorithms using MimControl() with M_DEINTERLACE_TYPE. They can be applied to the entire image or only to the pixels that are considered part of a moving object. To apply the algorithm to the latter, select the adaptive version of the algorithm (for example, M_ADAPTIVE_DISCARD). Often, the order in which the fields are grabbed will depend on the camera being used. When using an algorithm that produces two output frames (for example, M_BOB or M_ADAPTIVE_BOB), it is important to set the field that is grabbed first using MimControl() with M_FIRST_FIELD. This will ensure that the sequence of output frames occur in chronological order and that the video stream is fluid. The adaptive algorithms apply a motion detection algorithm to dynamically determine which pixels are part of an object in motion and which pixels are part of the background, prior to performing the deinterlacing algorithm. Using MimControl(), you can set the number of neighboring frames used for motion detection (M_MOTION_DETECT_NUM_FRAMES), the location of the frame to be processed within this group of frames (M_MOTION_DETECT_REFERENCE_FRAME), and the threshold value used to differentiate between pixels of objects in motion and pixels of background objects (M_MOTION_DETECT_THRESHOLD). To visualize which pixels are affected, you can have MimDeinterlace() output an image of these pixels, using MimControl() with M_MOTION_DETECT_OUTPUT; pixels that are part of an object in motion are set to the maximum value (0xFF for an a bit image), while the other pixels are set to 0. In this case, the deinterlacing part of the adaptive algorithm is not executed. Parameters Parameters DeinterlaceContextImId Specifies the identifier of the image processing context to be used for deinterlacing. The image processing context must have been previously allocated on the system using MimAlloc(). SrcImageArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_ID [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_ID&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(SrcImageCount) Specifies an array containing the identifiers of the buffers of the images to deinterlace. Only 8-bit and 16-bit buffers are supported. All source images must be of the same type, same format, and on the same system. Note that all source and destination images must have the same size. These images must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with them. Using images with an ROI will cause an error. DstImageArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_ID [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_ID&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(SrcImageCount) Specifies an array containing the identifiers of the buffers of the images in which to save the deinterlaced images.

These images must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with them. Using images with an ROI will cause an error. SrcImageCount Specifies the number of images in the source sequence. When using a standard vector (std::vector) overload function in C++, you can pass M_DEFAULT to this parameter and MIL will automatically determine the size based on the number of items in the vector passed to the SrcImageArrayPtr parameter.

This function can be used, for example, to calculate the gradient magnitude and orientation (angle) of edges in an image, or to sharpen an image. You can have MimDifferential() automatically calculate the required derivatives (in X and Y) of the source image by passing a linear IIR filter image processing context (previously allocated using MimAlloc() with M_LINEAR_FILTER_IIR_CONTEXT). MimDifferential() calculates the derivatives using IIR filters. You can partially define how the derivatives are calculated by configuring the IIR filter image processing context using MimControl(). MimDifferential() ignores the M_FILTER_OPERATION setting. You can have MimDifferential() use precalculated derivatives by passing derivative image buffers: most operations require one image buffer with the derivative in X, and another with the derivative in Y (for the first derivatives, this is synonymous with passing the vertical and horizontal edge detection images, respectively). Passing precalculated derivatives is useful if you need to calculate the derivatives using a specific filter operation (for example, using MimConvolve() with a predefined FIR filter or a custom kernel), or use the derivatives with multiple functions (in which case, it is more efficient to calculate the derivatives only once). Note that some operations require the first derivative images, while others require the second derivative images.

For example, if M_DEFAULT is specified and you have two rectangular blobs with two black holes (120x6 and 150x17), the dilation will continue until the black holes are reduced to 116x2 and 134x1, respectively (the smallest they can be before they disappear), and the background is reduced to the point it is about to disappear. Setting NbIteration to M_DEFAULT with any processing mode other than M_BINARY_ULTIMATE or M_BINARY_ULTIMATE_ACCUMULATE will cause an error. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the number of iterations. When this parameter is set to 0 and ProcMode is set to M_BINARY, the source image is binarized and the result is copied into the destination image buffer. When this parameter is set to 0 and ProcMode is set to M_GRAYSCALE, the source image is copied into the destination image buffer. ProcMode Specifies the processing mode to use. This parameter can be set to the following: For specifying the processing mode Value Description M_BINARY Performs a binary dilation on the white (non-zero) blobs in the image. In this case, non-zero pixels are treated as ones (1) during processing. The resulting non-zero pixels will have all bits set to one. M_BINARY_ULTIMATE Performs a binary dilation on the white (non-zero) blobs, while preventing the black (zero) holes and background from completely disappearing. When in this processing mode, this operation performs a binary dilation until the number of iterations NbIteration is reached or until the black holes and background are about to disappear. If NbIteration is not set to M_DEFAULT, the specified number of iterations serves as an upper bound limit, and the procedure continues until the specified number of iterations is reached or the black holes and background are about to disappear, whichever comes first. If NbIteration is set to M_DEFAULT, the procedure continues until the black holes and background are about to disappear. Note that if the dilation merges any blobs, the process continues on the merged blob. The holes and the background, however, are still evaluated individually. M_BINARY_ULTIMATE_ACCUMULATE Performs a binary erosion on the white (non-zero) blobs in the negative of the image, while preventing these blobs from completely disappearing and keeping track of the number of iterations. Note that the negative of the image is taken and the operation is switched to an erosion, so that each remaining pixel in a hole or the background can track the number of iterations needed to reach the current state. The resulting non-zero pixels will be set to the iteration number + 1. For example, consider an erosion with NbIteration set to 2. After the first iteration, the resulting non-zero pixels will be set to 1 + 1 (iteration number) = 2. After the second iteration,the resulting non-zero pixels will have all bits set to 1 + 2 (iteration number) = 3. This also means that what was considered the foreground is now considered the background, represented in black (zero), and what was considered holes and the background is now non-zero (iteration count). When in this processing mode, this operation performs a binary erosion on the negative of the image until the number of iterations NbIteration is reached or until the blobs are about to disappear. If NbIteration is not set to M_DEFAULT, the specified number of iterations serves as an upper bound limit, and the procedure continues until the specified number of iterations is reached or until the blobs are about to disappear, whichever comes first. If NbIteration is set to M_DEFAULT, the procedure continues until the blobs are about to disappear. Note that if the erosion splits any blobs, the process continues on each sub-blob, evaluating them separately. For more information on binary ultimate accumulate dilation, see the Erosion and dilation section of Chapter 3: Fundamental image processing. M_GRAYSCALE Performs a grayscale dilation on the white (non-zero) blobs. In this case, each pixel of the source image is replaced with the maximum value in its neighborhood.

Syntax void MimDistance( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;DistanceTransform //in ) Description This function determines the shortest distance between each blob pixel and the blob's background, and assigns this distance to the pixel. It produces a type of contour mapping of a blob. Parameters Parameters SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source of the operation. This parameter must be given an image buffer identifier. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination of the resulting image. This parameter must be given an image buffer identifier. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. DistanceTransform Specifies the way in which the minimum distance from blob pixel to background pixel is calculated. This parameter approximates the true distance from blob pixel to background pixel using a 3x3 distance matrix and can be set to one of the following: For specifying how to calculate the minimum distance Value Description M_CHAMFER_3_4 Determines the minimum distance using horizontal, vertical or diagonal pixel steps. Horizontal and vertical steps are counted as 3; diagonal steps are counted as 4. Then, the resulting distance is normalized by a factor of 3. This transform provides the best approximation to Euclidean distance. This transform requires that the destination buffer be deep enough to hold a number at least three times the maximum distance from a blob pixel to its edge. For example, an 8-bit buffer (255 max) can be used for a maximum distance of 85 pixels and a 16-bit buffer (65535 max) for a maximum distance of 21845 pixels. 3x3 Distance Matrix: M_CHESSBOARD Determines the minimum distance using horizontal, vertical, or diagonal pixel steps. All steps count as 1. 3x3 Distance Matrix: M_CITY_BLOCK Determines the minimum distance using only horizontal or vertical pixel steps. Horizontal and vertical steps count as 1. 3x3 Distance Matrix: Remark In-place processing is supported, but the source and destination image buffers cannot partially overlap (a situation that can only occur when using child buffers).

Syntax void MimDraw( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextGraId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;Src1MilId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;Src2MilId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufOrListGraId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Operation, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Param1, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Param2, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description The function draws the settings of an image processing context or the results of a MIL image processing operation, into a destination image buffer. You can also use MimDraw() to draw the internal copy of a source image that was passed to MimControl() or an image processing function and saved in an image processing context or result buffer. Note that the drawn image might differ from the original source image (for example, in bit depth). This is because, for greater optimization, an image processing context or result buffer might store its internal image data in a different format than the original source image buffer. Parameters Parameters ContextGraId Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics context to use. This parameter must be set to one of the following: For specifying the 2D graphics context Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the default 2D graphics context of the current MIL application is used. Note that there is a different default 2D graphics context for each thread. MIL 2D graphics context identifier Specifies a valid 2D graphics context identifier, which you have allocated using MgraAlloc(). Src1MilId Specifies the identifier of the primary source image buffer, result buffer, or image processing context from which to extract the results to draw. The buffer must have been previously allocated on the required system, using MbufAlloc...(), MimAllocResult(), or MimAlloc(), respectively. If an image buffer is specified, it must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Src2MilId Specifies the identifier of the secondary source image buffer for the drawing operation. The buffer must have been previously allocated on the required system using MbufAlloc...(). If this parameter is not required for the draw operation, it must be set to M_NULL. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. DstImageBufOrListGraId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer or 2D graphics list in which to draw. The buffer can be any valid MIL image buffer allocated using MbufAlloc...(). However, when the source buffers are image buffers, the destination image buffer should be greater than or equal in size and bit depth to the source image buffers. If the destination image buffer is smaller than the source image buffers, the excess will not be part of the destination image. If drawing an internal image contained in an image processing context or result buffer, the same destination buffer rule applies. In this case, you can use MimInquire() to find the size, depth, and other attributes of the internal image to correctly set the destination buffer. If specifying an image buffer, it must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. An operation can draw in a 2D graphics list only if it is specified in the operation's description. If you specify a 2D graphics list, the 2D graphics list must have been previously allocated using MgraAllocList(). You cannot use a 2D graphics list when drawing with wavelet transformations. Operation Specifies the type of operation to perform. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Param1 Specifies an attribute of the operation to perform. If this parameter is not required for the draw operation, it must be set to 0. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Param2 Specifies an attribute of the operation to perform. If this parameter is not required for the draw operation, it must be set to 0. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ControlFlag Specifies drawing constraints. You must set this parameter to M_DEFAULT unless you are drawing MimLocatePeak1d() or MimWaveletTransform() results. To specify the default drawing behavior, set this parameter to the following: For specifying the default drawing behavior Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default behavior. Except when drawing MimLocatePeak1d() or MimWaveletTransform() results, MIL ignores this parameter. When drawing MimLocatePeak1d() results, the default is M_FIXED_POINT + n, where n = 0. When drawing MimWaveletTransform() results, the default is M_AUTO_SCALE. To specify the number of fractional bits in the source values when using MimLocatePeak1d() results, set this parameter to the following: For specifying the number of fractional bits when using MimLocatePeak1d() results Value Description M_FIXED_POINT + n Specifies the number of fractional bits in the source values, when they are in a fixed-point format. Set n to an integer between 0 and 7, inclusive. To specify how to manage the range of pixel values when using MimWaveletTransform() results, set this parameter to one of the following: For specifying how to manage the range of pixel values when using MimWaveletTransform() results Value Description M_AUTO_SCALE Remaps pixel values (Src1MilId) according to the range of pixel values allowed in the destination (DstImageBufOrListGraId). M_SATURATION Clips pixel values (Src1MilId) that are outside the range of pixel values allowed in the destination (DstImageBufOrListGraId). Parameter associations The tables below list possible values for the Src1MilId, Src2MilId, Operation, Param1, and Param2 parameters. For specifying to perform the draw operation with the specified image processing context For specifying a draw operation that uses image processing results For specifying to perform the draw operation from image buffer(s) containing a depth map and/or intensity map For specifying to perform the draw operation with the result buffer(s) used in MimLocatePeak1d() In the following table, Src1MilId specifies an image processing context and Operation specifies the operation to perform with the specified image processing context. Src2MilId is not required and must be set to M_NULL. Set Param1 and Param2 to 0, unless otherwise specified. For specifying to perform the draw operation with the specified image processing context Src1MilId Description Operation Src2MilId Param1 Param2 Dead pixel correction image processing context ID Specifies a dead pixel correction image processing context used in MimDeadPixelCorrection() operations, allocated using MimAlloc() with M_DEAD_PIXEL_CONTEXT. M_DRAW_DEAD_PIXELS Draws the dead pixels image from the dead pixel correction image processing context. Flat-field image processing context ID Specifies an image processing context used in MimFlatField() operations, allocated using MimAlloc() with M_FLAT_FIELD_CONTEXT. M_DRAW_DARK_IMAGE Draws the dark image from the flat-field image processing context. The dark image represents the thermal agitation of the camera's CCD. M_DRAW_FLAT_IMAGE Draws the flat image from the flat-field context. The flat image represents the variation in sensitivity of each element of the camera's CCD. M_DRAW_OFFSET_IMAGE Draws the offset image from the flat-field context. The offset image represents the electrical bias of the camera's CCD. Match image processing context ID Specifies an image processing context used in MimMatch() operations, allocated using MimAlloc() with M_MATCH_CONTEXT. M_DRAW_MASK Draws the mask image from the match image processing context. All non-zero values in the image are considered mask pixels; these pixels will mask out corresponding pixels in the model image when MimMatch() performs the match. M_DRAW_MODEL Draws the model image from the match context. MimMatch() compares its source image against this model image. In the following table, Src1MilId specifies a result buffer and Operation specifies the operation to perform with the specified result buffer. Src2MilId is not required and must be set to M_NULL. Set Param1 and Param2 to 0, unless otherwise specified. For specifying a draw operation that uses image processing results Src1MilId Description Operation Src2MilId Param1 Param2 Augmentation result buffer ID Specifies an augmentation result buffer, allocated using MimAllocResult() with M_AUGMENTATION_RESULT, and used in MimAugment() operations. The DstImageBufOrListGraId parameter must specify an image buffer that can be processed (MbufAlloc...() with M_IMAGE + M_PROC). It must have the same number of bands and be the same type as the source used with MimAugment(). To specify an image buffer with an optimal size, so it can hold the results of all possible augmentations, call MimGetResult() with M_AUG_OPTIMAL_SIZE_X and M_AUG_OPTIMAL_SIZE_Y. M_DRAW_AUG_IMAGE Draws the resulting image of the augmentation. Find orientation result buffer ID Specifies a find orientation image processing result buffer identifier, allocated using MimAllocResult() with M_FIND_ORIENTATION_LIST. The result buffer must contain the dominant orientations (angle values found using MimFindOrientation()) of the image and the orientation scores (between 0 and 100). M_DRAW_IMAGE_ORIENTATION Draws arrows to represent the found image orientations (viewing angles) calculated by MimFindOrientation(). The center of each arrow will be at the center of the destination image buffer. The arrow's length is proportional to its score and the available space in the destination buffer (DstImageBufOrListGraId). With multiple calls to MimDraw(), you can set each arrow to have a different color, dictated by the 2D graphics context specified (ContextGraId). Depending on your requirements, you would either change the foreground color associated with the 2D graphics context or allocate multiple 2D graphics context each with a different foreground color. This can be useful for debugging your application. This operation can draw in a 2D graphics list. Src2MilId This parameter must be set to M_NULL. Param1 Specifies the index of the first orientation to draw from the result buffer. The first orientation in the result buffer is at index 0 and will have a score of 100%. Param2 Specifies the number of orientations to draw from the result buffer. The number of orientations cannot exceed the number of entries allocated using MimAllocResult() with NbEntries. Statistics result buffer ID Specifies a result buffer used to store MimStatCalculate() results, allocated using MimAllocResult() with M_STATISTICS_RESULT. M_DRAW_GLCM_MATRIX Draws the internally generated co-occurrence matrix. Note that the results are saturated to the maximum possible value for the specified destination buffer of the draw operation. The resulting co-occurrence matrix is resized to fit into the provided buffer, using closest neighbor interpolation. Note that only co-occurrence matrix statistics calculated using the entire source image can be drawn. Using results from a co-occurrence matrix window will generate an error. M_DRAW_STAT_RESULT Draws the specified statistical results of the image processing result buffer. Note that the results are saturated to the maximum possible value for the specified destination buffer of the draw operation. Src2MilId This parameter must be set to M_NULL. Param1 Specifies the type of statistical operation's result to draw. M_STAT_GLCM_CONTRAST Draws the results of the co-occurrence contrast matrix statistic. Note that the results are saturated to the maximum possible value for the specified destination buffer of the draw operation. The resulting co-occurrence matrix is resized to fit into the provided buffer, using closest neighbor interpolation. Only co-occurrence matrix statistics calculated using the entire source image can be drawn. If results from a co-occurrence matrix window, an error occurs. M_STAT_GLCM_CORRELATION Draws the results of the co-occurrence correlation matrix statistic. Note that the results are saturated to the maximum possible value for the specified destination buffer of the draw operation. The resulting co-occurrence matrix is resized to fit into the provided buffer, using closest neighbor interpolation. Only co-occurrence matrix statistics calculated using the entire source image can be drawn. If results from a co-occurrence matrix window, an error occurs. M_STAT_GLCM_DISSIMILARITY Draws the results of the co-occurrence dissimilarity matrix statistic. Note that the results are saturated to the maximum possible value for the specified destination buffer of the draw operation.

Only co-occurrence matrix statistics calculated using the entire source image can be drawn. If results from a co-occurrence matrix window, an error occurs. M_STAT_GLCM_ENERGY Draws the results of the co-occurrence energy matrix statistic. Note that the results are saturated to the maximum possible value for the specified destination buffer of the draw operation.

M_STAT_GLCM_ENTROPY Draws the results of the co-occurrence entropy matrix statistic. Note that the results are saturated to the maximum possible value for the specified destination buffer of the draw operation. The resulting co-occurrence matrix is resized to fit into the provided buffer, using closest neighbor interpolation. Only co-occurrence matrix statistics calculated using the entire source image can be drawn. If results from a co-occurrence matrix window, an error occurs. M_STAT_GLCM_HOMOGENEITY Draws the results of the co-occurrence homogeneity matrix statistic. Note that the results are saturated to the maximum possible value for the specified destination buffer of the draw operation. The resulting co-occurrence matrix is resized to fit into the provided buffer, using closest neighbor interpolation. Only co-occurrence matrix statistics calculated using the entire source image can be drawn. If results from a co-occurrence matrix window, an error occurs.

M_STAT_SUM_OF_SQUARES Draws the results of the sum of the squared pixel operation. Wavelet transformation result buffer ID Specifies a result buffer used to store MimWaveletTransform() results, allocated using MimAllocResult() with M_WAVELET_TRANSFORM_RESULT. The DstImageBufOrListGraId parameter must specify an image buffer that can be processed (MbufAlloc...() with M_IMAGE + M_PROC). It must have the same number of bands and be the same type as the source used with MimWaveletTransform(). For dyadic modes (MimControl() with M_TRANSFORMATION_MODE set to M_DYADIC), drawings are in the top-right (vertical coefficient), bottom-right (diagonal coefficient), and bottom-left (horizontal coefficient) corners of the display. This drawing pattern repeats for each level calculated (MimGetResult() with M_NUMBER_OF_LEVELS). Since dyadic transformations sample wavelet coefficients by a factor of 2 per level, drawings are resized at each level. MIL also draws the approximation (the low frequency rendition) of the wavelet transformation at the last level, in the top-left corner of the display. For undecimated modes (M_UNDECIMATED), drawings are in one row, per level. Each row is split into three columns, representing the horizontal (left column), diagonal (middle column), and vertical (right column) wavelet coefficients for that level. Since undecimated transformations are not sampled, drawings are all the same size, regardless of level. MIL also draws the approximation (the low frequency rendition) of the wavelet transformation at the last level, in the first column of the first row. The middle and right columns in this row are blank. M_DRAW_WAVELET Draws the resulting image of the wavelet transformation. During the wavelet transformation, calculations can require MIL to internally add padding data to the image's border. M_DRAW_WAVELET does not draw this padding with the resulting image. To retrieve the image size required to perform this operation, use MimGetResult() with M_WAVELET_DRAW_SIZE_X and M_WAVELET_DRAW_SIZE_Y. M_DRAW_WAVELET_WITH_PADDING Draws the resulting image of the wavelet transformation, with padding. During the wavelet transformation, calculations can require MIL to internally add padding data to the image's border. M_DRAW_WAVELET_WITH_PADDING draws the resulting image with this padding. To retrieve the image size required to perform this operation, use MimGetResult() with M_WAVELET_DRAW_SIZE_X_WITH_PADDING and M_WAVELET_DRAW_SIZE_Y_WITH_PADDING. Combination values for [when Src1MilId=Wavelet transformation result buffer ID: M_DRAW_WAVELET , M_DRAW_WAVELET_WITH_PADDING]. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to specify whether the drawing operation uses the real or imaginary numbers in the wavelet result. For specifying whether to draw using the real or imaginary numbers in the wavelet result Combination value Description M_IMAGINARY_PART Draws using the imaginary part of the values in the wavelet result. Only available for complex wavelet transformations (MimGetResult() with M_TRANSFORMATION_DOMAIN must return M_COMPLEX). M_REAL_PART Draws using only the real numbers in the result. Available for any type of wavelet transformation. This is the default value. In the following table, Src1MilId, and optionally Src2MilId, specify image buffer(s) and Operation specifies the operation to perform with the specified image buffer(s). For specifying to perform the draw operation from image buffer(s) containing a depth map and/or intensity map Src1MilId Description Operation Src2MilId Param1 Param2 Uncorrected depth map image buffer ID Specifies an image buffer containing an uncorrected depth map. The image buffer must be properly formatted. This is the format that would result if you iterated calls to MimLocatePeak1d() and then drew the results using MimDraw() with M_DRAW_DEPTH_MAP_ROW. For more information, see the Generating an uncorrected depth map subsection of the Peak intensity detection and depth maps section of Chapter 5: Specialized image processing. M_DRAW_PEAKS Draws the peaks at the position at which they were found in the original grayscale source image. It draws each peak using the peak's calculated intensity value or using the foreground color of the specified 2D graphics context. This operation cannot be rendered in world units (MgraControl() with M_INPUT_UNITS cannot be set to M_WORLD) when drawing in either an image buffer or a 2D graphics list. Additionally, this operation cannot be drawn with offset or zoom values (MgraControl() with M_DRAW_OFFSET_X or M_DRAW_OFFSET_Y set to values other than 0.0, and M_DRAW_ZOOM_X or M_DRAW_ZOOM_Y set to values other than 1.0). This operation can draw in a 2D graphics list if no intensity buffer is specified (Src2MilId set to M_NULL). You must specify a combination value from each of the following tables: To specify the direction in which the peak detection was performed To specify the style in which to draw Src2MilId Specifies whether the intensity results will be used when drawing the peaks. M_NULL Specifies to draw the peaks in the foreground color of the 2D graphics context specified using ContextGraId. Uncorrected intensity map image buffer ID Specifies an image buffer containing an uncorrected intensity map.

This is the format that would result if you iterated calls to MimLocatePeak1d() and then drew the results using MimDraw() with M_DRAW_INTENSITY_MAP_ROW. For more information, see the Generating an uncorrected depth map subsection of the Peak intensity detection and depth maps section of Chapter 5: Specialized image processing. If you supply an intensity buffer, the intensity buffer defines the drawing color when drawing each position, regardless of the setting of ContextGraId. ContextGraId must be set to M_DEFAULT. Param1 Specifies the row in the source image buffers from which to read the results. Param2 Specifies the size of the drawn representation of valid peaks. When drawing the peaks as dots (M_DOTS), this parameter specifies the diameter of the dots that are drawn at valid positions; when connecting the peaks using lines (M_LINES), this parameter specifies the width of the line segments that connect valid positions. M_FROM_LINE_THICKNESS Specifies to use the M_LINE_THICKNESS setting of the 2D graphics context as the size of the drawn representation of valid peaks. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the size of the drawn representation of valid peaks, in pixels. In the following table, Src1MilId specifies the result buffer and Operation specifies the operation to perform with the specified result buffer. For specifying to perform the draw operation with the result buffer(s) used in MimLocatePeak1d() Src1MilId Description Operation Src2MilId Param1 Param2 Locate peak 1D result buffer ID Specifies a result buffer allocated using MimAllocResult() with M_LOCATE_PEAK_1D_RESULT and used in MimLocatePeak1d() operations. M_DRAW_DEPTH_MAP_ROW Specifies to write the position values of the specified result buffer into a single row of the specified image buffer. Note that if the result buffer contains results from multiple frames, and you specify to draw all results (M_ALL), each frame's results will be drawn into a separate row, beginning at the row index specified with Param1. Src2MilId This parameter must be set to M_NULL. Param1 Specifies the row of the specified image buffer in which to write the position values. In the case of multiple peaks, the position of the first peak is drawn, as defined using MimControl() with M_SORT_CRITERION. When drawing results from multiple frames, this parameter specifies the first row in which to draw. Param2 Specifies the index of the frame(s) for which to draw position values. Set this parameter to 0 if not drawing results from multiple frames. M_ALL Specifies to draw results from all frames whose results have been accumulated in the result buffer. 0 &lt;= Value &lt; M_NUMBER_OF_FRAMES Specifies the index of the specific frame for which to draw results. M_DRAW_INTENSITY_MAP_ROW Specifies to write the intensity values of the specified result buffer into a single row of the specified image buffer. The default intensity value for missing peaks, M_INVALID, corresponds to the value -1 (or an unsigned buffer's maximum value); to specify a different value, use MimControl() with M_PEAK_INTENSITY_INVALID_VALUE. Note that if the result buffer contains results from multiple frames, and you specify to draw all results (M_ALL), each frame's results will be drawn into a separate row, beginning at the row index specified with Param1. Src2MilId This parameter must be set to M_NULL. Param1 Specifies the row of the specified image buffer in which to write the intensity values.

M_DRAW_PEAKS Draws the peaks at the position at which they were found in the original source image. It draws each peak using the foreground color of the specified 2D graphics context. This operation cannot be rendered in world units (MgraControl() with M_INPUT_UNITS cannot be set to M_WORLD) when drawing in either an image buffer or a 2D graphics list. Additionally, this operation cannot be drawn with offset or zoom values (MgraControl() with M_DRAW_OFFSET_X or M_DRAW_OFFSET_Y set to values other than 0.0, and M_DRAW_ZOOM_X or M_DRAW_ZOOM_Y set to values other than 1.0). Src2MilId This parameter must be set to M_NULL. Param1 Specifies the rank index of the peak from which to read the results, or specifies the frame and rank index, in the case of a result buffer with multiple frames. M_SELECT_PEAK( MIL_INT Frame, MIL_INT Rank ) Specifies the frame and rank of the peak(s) for which to draw the requested result. This macro is required if a MimLocatePeak1d() operation accumulated results from multiple frames in the result buffer (MimControl() with M_NUMBER_OF_FRAMES set to a value greater than 1). Parameters Frame Specifies the index of the frame for which the result was stored. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the index of the specific frame.

Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the size of the drawn representation of valid peaks, in pixels. Combination values for [when Src1MilId=Uncorrected depth map image buffer ID: M_DRAW_PEAKS]. You must add one of the following values to the above-mentioned value to specify the style in which to draw. For specifying the style in which to draw Combination value Description M_CROSS Specifies to draw the valid result positions as crosses. The destination buffer must be a 2D graphics list. When M_CROSS is specified, only valid positions are drawn; if a peak was not found for a row/column, nothing will be drawn for that row/column. M_DOTS Specifies to draw the valid result positions as dots. When M_DOTS is specified, only valid positions are drawn; if a peak was not found for a row/column, nothing will be drawn for that row/column.

Syntax void MimEdgeDetect( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstIntensityImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstAngleImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;KernelId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;Threshold //in ) Description This function performs an edge detection operation on the specified source image, using the specified filter. It produces a gradient intensity image and/or a gradient angle image in the specified image buffer(s). If one of the destination images is not required, specify M_NULL as its image buffer identifier. For an unsigned destination buffer, the angle is returned from 0° to 360° (counter-clockwise) and mapped to the entire range of the destination buffer. For example, for an 8-bit unsigned buffer, the angles of 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° map to 0, 64, 128, and 192, respectively. For a signed destination buffer, mapping is done in both the positive and negative range of the buffer and represents angle values from -180° to 180°. For example, for an 8-bit signed buffer, the angles of -180°, -90°, 0°, and 90° map to -128, -64, 0 and 64, respectively. This function can also be performed on a floating-point buffer. However, the results are not mapped and are returned in the range of 0° to 360°. The degree of precision is equal to the precision of the floating-point buffer for regular computation or to +/- 0.4° for fast computation. The value for undefined results is the maximum positive value of the floating-point buffer. You can perform the operation using a combination of fast and full gradient and angle computations. Type of computation Description of computation Full gradient computation Gradient = sqrt(GradientX*GradientX + GradientY*GradientY) Fast gradient computation Gradient = (abs(GradientX) + abs(GradientY))/2 Full angle computation Angle = arctan(-GradientY/GradientX) Fast angle computation The fast angle approximation is based on the same equation as the full angle computation; however, the value is determined from a LUT mapping. Parameters Parameters SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source of the operation. This parameter must be given an image buffer identifier. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. DstIntensityImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination buffer for the resulting gradient intensity image. This parameter must be given an image buffer identifier or M_NULL. Saturation is performed on this buffer. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. DstAngleImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination buffer for the resulting gradient angle image. This parameter must be given an image buffer identifier or M_NULL. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Note that this parameter cannot be set to M_NULL if DstIntensityImageBufId is also set to M_NULL, otherwise an error will occur. KernelId Specifies the filter to use. This parameter must be set to the value below. For specifying the filter to use Value Description M_SOBEL Specifies to use the predefined 3x3 edge detection filters. The following kernel is convolved with the image to produce GradientX, which is an intermediate image used in the gradient or angle computation. For each pixel, GradientX contains directional derivative values calculated from horizontal (X-direction) intensity changes. The following kernel is convolved with the image to produce GradientY, which, like GradientX, is an intermediate image used in the gradient or angle computation. For each pixel, GradientY contains directional derivative values calculated from vertical (Y-direction) intensity changes. Combination values for the values listed in For specifying the filter to use. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned value to specify the overscan settings to use for the operation. For specifying the overscan setting Combination value Description M_OVERSCAN_DISABLE Specifies to disable overscanning for this operation. You should disable overscanning to accelerate the operation for applications in which the overscan data is not important in the resulting buffer. M_OVERSCAN_ENABLE Specifies to enable overscanning for this operation. The overscan uses pixels from the ancestor of the source buffer. If the source buffer is not a child buffer, or if the point falls outside the ancestor buffer, a mirror type overscan is used. A mirror overscan specifies that the overscan pixels will be a mirror copy of the source buffer's border pixels. This is the default value. M_OVERSCAN_FAST Specifies that MIL will automatically select the overscan that optimizes speed, according to the specified operation and the target system. The overscan could be hardware-specific thereby having a different behavior than the other supported overscan modes. Note that when using M_OVERSCAN_FAST, the destination pixels in the overscan area are undefined. The pixels can therefore contain different values from one function call to the next, even if the function's parameter values are the same. ControlFlag Specifies how to perform the operation. This parameter can be set to one of the following: For specifying how to perform the operation Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_FAST_EDGE_DETECT. M_FAST_ANGLE + M_REGULAR_GRADIENT Specifies a full gradient computation and a fast angle approximation. M_FAST_EDGE_DETECT Specifies a fast gradient computation and a fast angle approximation. The gradient is computed as an approximation, using the average of the absolute value of the two directional components (X and Y). M_REGULAR_ANGLE + M_FAST_GRADIENT Specifies a fast gradient computation and a full angle computation. M_REGULAR_EDGE_DETECT Specifies a full gradient computation and a full angle computation. The gradient is computed as the square root of the sum of the square of each directional component (X and Y). This calculation is slower but more precise. Threshold Specifies the threshold value for calculating the gradient angle. For a gradient intensity value lower than the threshold value, the angle is not computed (not considered a significant edge) and the resulting angle for that pixel is undetermined. To perform the full operation, set this parameter to zero or M_NULL. Note that if MIL determines that calculating the gradient angle of all pixels is faster than excluding some pixels from the computation, the threshold value is simply ignored.

Syntax void MimErode( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;NbIteration, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ProcMode //in ) Description This function performs a binary or grayscale erosion on the given source image for the specified number of iterations. In binary mode, this function uses a 3x3 full rectangular structuring element; in grayscale mode, a 3x3 empty one. The overscan pixels are automatically set to the highest possible buffer value, which will produce the most accurate possible results for the image border pixels. Parameters Parameters SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source image buffer. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. NbIteration Specifies the number of times to iterate the operation. For specifying the number of iterations to perform Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that each blob should be eroded until it is about to disappear. This value is only available when ProcMode is set to M_BINARY_ULTIMATE or M_BINARY_ULTIMATE_ACCUMULATE. M_DEFAULT does not specify an explicit number of iterations to perform; instead, it indicates to the function that each blob should be eroded until it is about to disappear. For example, if M_DEFAULT is specified and you have two rectangular blobs (120x6 and 150x17), the erosion will continue until the blobs are reduced to 116x2 and 134x1, respectively (the smallest they can be before they disappear). Setting NbIteration to M_DEFAULT with any processing mode other than M_BINARY_ULTIMATE or M_BINARY_ULTIMATE_ACCUMULATE will cause an error. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the number of iterations. When this parameter is set to 0 and ProcMode is set to M_BINARY, the source image is binarized and the result is copied into the destination image buffer. When this parameter is set to 0 and ProcMode is set to M_GRAYSCALE, the source image is copied into the destination image buffer. ProcMode Specifies the processing mode to use. This parameter can be set to the following: For specifying the processing mode Value Description M_BINARY Performs a binary erosion on the white (non-zero) blobs in the image. In this case, non-zero pixels are treated as ones (1) during processing. The resulting non-zero pixels will have all bits set to one. M_BINARY_ULTIMATE Performs a binary erosion on the white (non-zero) blobs, while preventing them from completely disappearing. When in this processing mode, this operation performs a binary erosion until the number of iterations NbIteration is reached or until the blob is about to disappear. If NbIteration is not set to M_DEFAULT, the specified number of iterations serves as an upper bound limit, and the procedure continues until the specified number of iterations is reached or the blob is about to disappear, whichever comes first. If NbIteration is set to M_DEFAULT, the procedure continues until the non-zero blob is about to disappear. Note that if the erosion splits any blobs, the process continues on each sub-blob evaluating them separately. M_BINARY_ULTIMATE_ACCUMULATE Performs a binary erosion on the white (non-zero) blobs, while preventing them from completely disappearing and keeping track of the number of iterations. When in this processing mode, this operation performs a binary erosion until the number of iterations NbIteration is reached or until the blob is about to disappear. If NbIteration is not set to M_DEFAULT, the specified number of iterations serves as an upper bound limit, and the procedure continues until the specified number of iterations is reached or the blob is about to disappear, whichever comes first. If NbIteration is set to M_DEFAULT, the procedure continues until the non-zero blob is about to disappear. Note that if the erosion splits any blobs, the process continues on each sub-blob, evaluating them separately. The resulting non-zero pixels will be set to the iteration number + 1. For example, consider an erosion with NbIteration set to 2. After the first iteration, the resulting non-zero pixels will be set to 1 + 1 (iteration number) = 2. After the second iteration,the resulting non-zero pixels will be set to 1 + 2 (iteration number) = 3. For more information on erosion see the Erosion and dilation section of Chapter 3: Fundamental image processing. For more information on binary ultimate accumulate erosion, see the Erosion and dilation section of Chapter 3: Fundamental image processing. M_GRAYSCALE Performs a grayscale erosion on the white (non-zero) blobs in the image. In this case, each pixel of the source image is replaced with the minimum value in its neighborhood.

Depending on the application, MimFilterAdaptive() will require different value settings for the Param1, Param2, Param3 and ControlFlag parameters. It is recommended that you experiment with different settings to achieve the best level of noise reduction and edge preservation for your application. Note that adaptive filters are slower than other similar operations, such as rank filters (MimRank()) and most of the filters available using MimConvolve(). If edge preservation is less important than speed for your application, try the predefined or custom filters available in MimConvolve(). Parameters Parameters AdaptiveFilterContextImId Specifies the predefined adaptive filter context to use. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source image buffer. This image buffer must be 1-band and not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer. This image buffer must be 1-band and not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Param1 Specifies an attribute of the operation to perform. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Param2 Specifies an attribute of the operation to perform. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Param3 Specifies an attribute of the operation to perform. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ControlFlag Specifies how to determine the new value for a pixel determined to be noise. If not used, set this parameter to M_DEFAULT. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Parameter associations The table below lists possible values for the AdaptiveFilterContextImId, Param1, Param2, Param3, and ControlFlag parameters. For specifying parameters of a bilateral, noise peak elimination, guided, or fast guided adaptive filter operation The following AdaptiveFilterContextImId and associated Param1, Param2, Param3, and ControlFlag settings are used to determine the type of adaptive filtering to perform. For specifying parameters of a bilateral, noise peak elimination, guided, or fast guided adaptive filter operation AdaptiveFilterContextImId Description Param1 Param2 Param3 ControlFlag M_BILATERAL Specifies a bilateral adaptive filter operation. A bilateral filter smooths an image while preserving its features. It is effectively an edge-preserving filter. Bilateral adaptive filtering is based on spatial and intensity weights given to each pixel in a neighborhood, and results in greater or lesser degrees of smoothing and edge preservation, depending on the values set with Param1, Param2, and Param3. This function performs an operation similar to MimConvolve(), except the kernel used in calculations is variable and adapts to the content of the source image. Param1 Sets the amount of spatial smoothing to perform. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the amount of smoothing. A larger value applies more smoothing than a smaller value. Note that, beyond a certain value, all the spatial weights in the neighborhood become equal; further increasing Param1 would be useless, but not detrimental. Param2 Sets how well pixel differences (edges) will be preserved by the smoothing operation. 0.0 &lt; Value &lt;= 1.0 Specifies the amount of acceptable edge loss. To preserve edges, set Param2 to a low value. Typically, this parameter is set to a decimal value much less than one. Param3 Sets the spatial window (neighborhood size) for the operation. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the spatial window (neighborhood size), in pixels. This parameter should typically be set to an odd value so the kernel is centered on a whole pixel. Even values are supported but not advised. M_FAST_GUIDED Specifies a fast guided adaptive filter operation. A fast guided filter smooths an image while preserving its edges. Fast guided filtering separates image information into edges and homogenous areas. Two sub-images are created, one by blurring the homogenous areas of the image and the other containing the location of the edges. A new image is then constructed by combining these two sub-images with the original image. The fast guided filter improves the computational speed of the guided filter by sub-sampling the original image and then up-sampling before constructing the final image. This is at the cost of a slightly degraded result. Note, only 8-bit and 16-bit unsigned image buffers are supported for guided filter operations. Param1 Sets the sub-sampling scale factor. Value &gt;= 1.0 Specifies the scale factor. Param2 Sets how well pixel differences (edges) will be preserved by the smoothing operation. 0.0 &lt; Value &lt;= 1.0 Specifies the amount of acceptable edge loss. To preserve edges, set Param2 to a low value. Typically, this parameter is set to a decimal value much less than one. Param3 Sets the spatial window (neighborhood size) for the operation. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the spatial window (neighborhood size), in pixels. This parameter should typically be set to an odd value so the kernel is centered on a whole pixel. Even values are supported but not advised. M_GUIDED Specifies a guided adaptive filter operation. A guided filter smooths an image while preserving its edges. Guided filtering separates image information into edges and homogenous areas. Two sub-images are created, one by blurring the homogenous areas of the image and the other containing the location of the edges. A new image is then constructed by combining these two sub-images with the original image. Note, only 8-bit and 16-bit unsigned image buffers are supported for guided filter operations. Param1 This parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value. Param2 Sets how well pixel differences (edges) will be preserved by the smoothing operation. 0.0 &lt; Value &lt;= 1.0 Specifies the amount of acceptable edge loss. To preserve edges, set Param2 to a low value. Typically, this parameter is set to a decimal value much less than one. Param3 Sets the spatial window (neighborhood size) for the operation. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the spatial window (neighborhood size), in pixels. This parameter should typically be set to an odd value so the kernel is centered on a whole pixel. Even values are supported but not advised. M_NOISE_PEAK_REMOVAL Specifies a noise peak elimination adaptive filter operation. A noise peak elimination filter iteratively replaces the central pixel in a 3x3 neighborhood, if the pixel is a minimum or maximum within that neighborhood, and differs from the replacement value by more than a specified threshold. The replacement value is based on the neighboring pixels; how the replacement value is calculated can be set using the ControlFlag parameter. Optionally, you can specify a gap value. A pixel must be smaller/greater than the minimum/maximum of its neighbors by at least this amount to be considered the minimum/maximum of its neighborhood. The operation performed is similar to using MimRank() with M_3X3_RECT, except that the rank value is variable and adapts to the content of the source image. Param1 Sets the number of iterations to perform. M_DEFAULT Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the number of iterations. Param2 Sets the gap value. A pixel must be smaller/greater than the minimum/maximum of its neighbors by at least this amount to be considered the minimum/maximum of its neighborhood. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the gap value. Param3 Sets the replacement threshold. A pixel is only determined to be noise if its value differs from the replacement value by more than this threshold. The ControlFlag parameter determines how the replacement value is calculated. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the replacement threshold. ControlFlag Sets how to calculate the replacement value for each pixel. The replacement value is used to determine whether the pixel is noise. If the pixel is determined to be noise, it is replaced with this value. M_DEFAULT Same as M_MEDIAN. M_EXTREME Specifies that the replacement value for each pixel is the minimum or maximum value of the neighboring pixels. The extreme closest to the pixel's current value is used. M_MEAN Specifies that the replacement value for each pixel is the average value of the neighboring pixels. M_MEDIAN Specifies that the replacement value for each pixel is the median value of the neighboring pixels. Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; milim.lib.

The structuring element defines a neighborhood around each pixel of the source image buffer, and the value that appears most often in the neighborhood replaces the value of the central pixel. When using a custom structuring element, you can specify weights for the pixels in the neighborhood. The weights define the number of times to count the value of the corresponding pixel when establishing the frequency of the different pixel values. If the weights in the custom structuring element buffer are not uniform, then certain neighborhood pixels will have more influence during the majority filter operation. For example, if you set the central value to 2, and all others to 1, then the central pixel's value will be counted twice during the majority filter operation. When using a custom majority filter image processing context, instead of passing a structuring element, you associate a weight image with the context (MimControl() with M_WEIGHT_IMAGE). It is used similar to a structuring element, but allows you to save the weights with the context when calling MimSave() or MimStream(). By default, if two or more pixel values tie for the greatest frequency, the smallest value present among the tied values is used. If you are using a custom context, you can use MimControl() with M_TIE_BREAKER_MODE to change the default behavior. If you have specified weights for the pixels in your neighborhood, it is possible that two pixel values are tied despite not occurring with equal frequency in the neighborhood. In this case, you can chose to break the tie based on the non-weighted frequency of the values in the source image rather than their values, using MimControl() with M_USE_FREQUENCY_TIE_BREAKER. If the source and destination are multi-band buffers, the same structuring element (neighborhood and weights) is applied to every band of the source buffer. Once the majority filter image processing context is configured, preprocess the context by calling MimFilterMajority() with M_PREPROCESS. If the preprocess operation is not done explicitly (using M_PREPROCESS), it will be done when MimFilterMajority() is first called. When preprocessing explicitly, the source and destination image buffers can be set to M_NULL. If, however, the source or destination image buffer is provided, it will be used in the preprocess operation, to better optimize future calls. Parameters Parameters MajorityFilterContextImId Specifies the identifier of the majority filter image processing context. You can specify to use a predefined image processing context, or you can pass the identifier of a custom context. If you want to use a custom image processing context, it must have been previously allocated, using MimAlloc() with M_FILTER_MAJORITY_CONTEXT. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source image buffer. The source image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it; using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer. The destination image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it; using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. StructElemBufId Specifies the identifier of the structuring element that defines the neighborhood around each pixel, and, optionally, the weights of the pixels in the neighborhood. Note that floating-point buffers are not supported. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ControlFlag Specifies whether to preprocess a custom image processing context or to execute the filtering operation. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Parameter associations The table below lists possible values for the MajorityFilterContextImId, StructElemBufId, and ControlFlag parameters. For specifying the settings of the majority filter operation For specifying the settings of the majority filter operation MajorityFilterContextImId Description StructElemBufId ControlFlag M_DEFAULT Specifies to use a predefined majority filter image processing context that replaces the value of each pixel with the most common value in its neighborhood, as defined by the structuring element. You can optionally specify weights in the structuring element. When using a predefined image processing context, you must set ControlFlag to M_DEFAULT. StructElemBufId Specifies which pixels are included in the neighborhood surrounding a central pixel. Only valid neighboring pixels are included in the neighborhood. For example, the pixel in the top-left corner of the source image will not have any neighboring pixels above it or to its left. M_3X3_CROSS Specifies a cross (+) structuring element whose neighborhood size is 3x3 pixels. In this case, there are 5 valid neighborhood pixels; the function ignores the pixels located at the four corners of the neighborhood. M_3X3_RECT Specifies a structuring element whose neighborhood size is 3x3 pixels. In this case, there are 9 valid neighborhood pixels; the function does not ignore any pixels in the neighborhood. M_5X5_RECT Specifies a structuring element whose neighborhood size is 5x5 pixels. In this case, there are 25 valid neighborhood pixels; the function does not ignore any pixels in the neighborhood. Custom structuring element identifier Specifies to define the neighborhood using a custom structuring element. You must first allocate this structuring element, using MbufAlloc2d() with M_STRUCT_ELEMENT. You can use MbufPut2d() to populate your custom structuring element buffer with structuring element values. Note that the custom structuring element must not be a floating-point buffer. The structuring element defines the size and the weights of the neighborhood. If the weights in the custom structuring element buffer are not uniform, then certain neighborhood pixels will have more influence during the majority filter operation. For example, if you set the central value to 2, and all others to 1, then the central pixel's value will be counted twice during the majority filter operation. ControlFlag This parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. MIL custom majority filter image processing context identifier Specifies a custom majority filter image processing context, allocated using MimAlloc() with M_FILTER_MAJORITY_CONTEXT. When using a custom majority filter image processing context, you must set StructElemBufId to M_NULL. To specify the neighborhood (with weights, if applicable), you must pass the identifier of an image buffer to MimControl() with M_WEIGHT_IMAGE prior to calling this function. StructElemBufId This parameter must be set to M_NULL since the neighborhood is defined using an image. ControlFlag Specifies whether to preprocess the custom image processing context or to execute the filtering operation. M_DEFAULT Specifies to execute the majority filter operation. If you have not yet preprocessed your custom image processing context, it will be preprocessed upon the first call to MimFilterMajority(). M_PREPROCESS Specifies to preprocess your custom image processing context. Preprocessing the context can speed up subsequent calls to MimFilterMajority().

The minimum value is stored in the first entry and the maximum value is stored in the second. ExtremeType Specifies the type of extreme(s) to find. To find the actual minimum and/or maximum pixel value(s) in the buffer, specify one or a combination of the values from the following table. For example, to find both the maximum and minimum values, set the ExtremeType parameter to M_MIN_VALUE + M_MAX_VALUE. For specifying whether to find the minimum value, maximum value, or both Value Description M_MAX_VALUE Finds the maximum value. M_MIN_VALUE Finds the minimum value. To find the minimum absolute value, maximum absolute value, or both, specify one or a combination of the values from the following table. For example, to find both the maximum absolute and minimum absolute values, set the ExtremeType parameter to M_MIN_ABS_VALUE + M_MAX_ABS_VALUE. For specifying whether to find the minimum absolute value, maximum absolute value, or both Value Description M_MAX_ABS_VALUE Finds the maximum value, as an absolute value.

Syntax void MimFindOrientation( MIL_ID&nbsp;OrientationContextImId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;OrientationResultImId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function finds the dominant orientations of the source image using the consistent spatial patterns in the image. MIL writes the list of dominant orientations (best viewing angles) and their associated score in the specified result buffer. The number of orientations found depends on the number of entries allocated in the find orientation result buffer using MimAllocResult() with M_FIND_ORIENTATION_LIST. You can read the calculated orientations (angle values) and their associated scores using MimGetResult1d() with M_ANGLE and M_SCORE, respectively. This function requires the source image buffer to have dimensions that are a power of 2. If the image buffer's dimensions do not meet this criteria, you can use MimControl() with M_MODE and MimControl() with M_INTERPOLATION_MODE to specify how MIL should clip or resize the image for calculations. This will not alter the original image. Parameters Parameters OrientationContextImId Specifies the find orientation image processing context. For specifying the find orientation image processing context Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default M_FIND_ORIENTATION_CONTEXT context with all the controls in the context set to their default value. Find orientation image processing context ID Specifies a valid find orientation image processing context identifier, previously allocated using MimAlloc() with M_FIND_ORIENTATION_CONTEXT. SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source image. The buffer used must be a 1-band image buffer. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. OrientationResultImId Specifies the identifier of the find orientation result buffer.

Syntax void MimFlatField( MIL_ID&nbsp;FlatFieldContextImId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function applies a per-pixel gain and offset correction to the source image and writes the results in the destination image. This process removes artifacts from grabbed images, such as electrical bias, thermal agitation, and sensitivity variations. The following equation defines the relationship between the source and destination pixel values. Before using this function, you must configure the specified image processing context with the gain to apply, and the electrical bias, thermal agitation, and CCD sensitivity to remove, using MimControl(); otherwise, an error is reported. You can specify each of these on a per-pixel level using an image or on a global level using a constant. Once the flat-field correction image processing context is configured, preprocess the context by calling MimFlatField() with M_PREPROCESS. If the preprocess operation is not done explicitly (using M_PREPROCESS), it will be done when MimFlatField() is first called. When preprocessing explicitly, the source and destination image buffers can be set to M_NULL. If, however, the source or destination image buffer is provided, it will be used in the preprocess operation, to better optimize future calls. Parameters Parameters FlatFieldContextImId Specifies the identifier of a flat-field image processing context, previously allocated using MimAlloc() with M_FLAT_FIELD_CONTEXT. SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source image buffer. The buffer must be either an 8- or 16-bit unsigned image buffer. When preprocessing a flat-field image processing context, set this parameter to the identifier of a typical source image buffer. Otherwise, to exclude the buffer from preprocessing, set this parameter to M_NULL. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer. The buffer must be either an 8- or 16-bit unsigned image buffer. When preprocessing a flat-field image processing context, set this parameter to the identifier of a typical destination image buffer. Otherwise, to exclude the destination image buffer from preprocessing, set this parameter to M_NULL. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. ControlFlag Specifies the operation to perform. This parameter must be set to one of the following values. For specifying the operation to perform. Value Description M_DEFAULT Performs the flat-field correction operation. M_PREPROCESS Preprocesses the specified image processing context. Note that, if not called explicitly, this operation will be performed automatically upon the first call to MimFlatField(). If the identifier of the source and/or destination buffer is not set to M_NULL, information about the source and/or destination image buffer will be used in the preprocessing operation.

The number of arrays and the nature of the values depend on the image processing context used and on the specified type of information to get. Before you can inquire the content of the array(s), they must be set using MimPut(), unless otherwise specified. To determine the size of the arrays required to store the requested values, call this function and set Param1Ptr and Param2Ptr to M_NULL. Alternatively, when dealing with a dead pixel correction image processing context, to determine the size of the arrays required to store the X- and Y- coordinates of the dead pixels, you can also use MimInquire() with M_XY_DEAD_PIXELS_ARRAY_SIZE. When dealing with a rearrangement image processing context, to determine the size of the arrays required to store the X- and Y- coordinates of the areas to move from the source to the destination and to determine the number of areas to be copied, you can also use MimInquire() with M_XY_DESTINATION_ARRAY_SIZE, M_XY_SIZE_ARRAY_SIZE, and M_XY_SOURCE_ARRAY_SIZE, respectively. Parameters Parameters ContextImId Specifies the identifier of the image processing context. The image processing context must have been previously allocated with MimAlloc(). See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. GetType Specifies the type of information in the array(s). See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ArraySize Specifies the number of values in the array(s).

If your target image was associated with a camera calibration context, positional and dimensional results are, by default, returned with respect to the relative coordinate system of the image. Otherwise, these results are returned in pixels, relative to the top-left pixel in the target image. If your target image was associated with a camera calibration context, but you want to retrieve positional and dimensional results in pixel units, use MimControl() with the M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS control type set to M_PIXEL. However, note that if you set M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS to M_WORLD without specifying a calibrated image in which to calculate the results, MimGetResult1d() will generate an error.

M_VALID Retrieves the validity of projection data, from an M_PROJ_LIST result buffer. This is only useful when a region of interest is associated with the source image buffer of the projection operation. A lane of pixels will contain no valid pixels if it is excluded from the region of interest associated with the source image; this means that projection data cannot be calculated for the lane. However, the M_PROJ_LIST result buffer contains an entry for each lane of pixels found in the source image, regardless of the use of a region of interest. So when your source image buffer has a region of interest, you should use M_VALID to check the validity of the data for the lane in the result buffer. Note that for an M_SUM projection operation, if a lane of pixels does not contain valid projection data, a neutral pixel value of 0 is used for that lane. In this case, M_VALID will indicate valid projection data for all lanes of pixels in the image.

Syntax void MimGetResult( MIL_ID&nbsp;ResultImId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ResultType, //in void&nbsp;*UserArrayPtr //out ) Description This function retrieves all the results of the specified type from the specified result buffer and stores them in the specified one-dimensional destination user array. Results are only available after calling MimCountDifference(), MimFindExtreme(), MimHistogram(), MimLocateEvent(), MimProjection(), MimStatCalculate(), or MimWaveletTransform(). If your target image was associated with a camera calibration context, positional and dimensional results are, by default, returned with respect to the relative coordinate system of the image. Otherwise, these results are returned in pixels, relative to the top-left pixel in the target image. If your target image was associated with a camera calibration context but you want to retrieve positional and dimensional results in pixel units, use MimControl() with the M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS control type set to M_PIXEL. However, note that if you set M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS to M_WORLD without specifying a calibrated image in which to calculate the results, MimGetResult() will generate an error. If your results were calculated using MimStatCalculate(), the M_STATISTICS_RESULT buffer contains results from an operation performed on a single image (M_STATISTICS_CONTEXT context), or from cumulative operations performed on numerous images (M_STATISTICS_CUMULATIVE_CONTEXT context). Single image results are calculated from all pixels, a region of interest (ROI), or tiled regions of the single image; whereas, cumulative results are calculated for the same pixel location across multiple images. Use MimGetResult2d() to obtain most cumulative results. Note that M_STAT_NUMBER and M_TOTAL_NUMBER are available for cumulative results using MimGetResult(). Also use MimGetResult() to retrieve statistics results from a single image divided into tiles (specified using MimControl() with M_TILE_SIZE... and M_STEP_SIZE...). For a tiled image, one result per tile is returned for most of the supported statistics.

M_UNDECIMATED Specifies an undecimated wavelet transformation. M_VALID Retrieves the validity of projection data for each lane, from an M_PROJ_LIST result buffer. This is only useful when a region of interest is associated with the source image buffer of the projection operation. A lane of pixels will contain no valid pixels if it is excluded from the region of interest associated with the source image; this means that projection data cannot be calculated for the lane. However, the M_PROJ_LIST result buffer contains an entry for each lane of pixels found in the source image, regardless of the use of a region of interest. So when your source image buffer has a region of interest, you should use M_VALID to check the validity of the data for the lane in the result buffer. Note that for an M_SUM projection operation, if a lane of pixels does not contain valid projection data, a neutral pixel value of 0 is used for that lane. In this case, M_VALID will indicate valid projection data for all lanes of pixels in the image.

Syntax void MimGetResultSingle( MIL_ID&nbsp;ResultImId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Index1, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Index2, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ResultType, //in void&nbsp;*UserArrayPtr //out ) Description This function retrieves a result of the specified type from a wavelet transformation or 1D locate peak result buffer. MIL performs wavelet transformations with MimWaveletTransform() and 1D peak intensity detection with MimLocatePeak1d(). Parameters Parameters ResultImId Specifies the identifier of the wavelet transformation or 1D locate peak result buffer from which to get results. Index1 Specifies the first index with which to indicate the result to retrieve. For a wavelet transformation result, this parameter specifies a specific wavelet coefficient and level for which to get information. To retrieve the actual number of levels calculated, call MimGetResult() with M_NUMBER_OF_LEVELS. You can also use this parameter to retrieve information about the approximation (the low frequency rendition) of the wavelet transformation. Set this parameter to one of the following: For specifying the first index, for which to retrieve the wavelet transformation result Value Description M_DIAGONAL_LEVEL( MIL_INT Level ) Retrieves results about the diagonal wavelet coefficient, at the specified transformation level. Parameters Level Specifies the transformation level. 0 &lt; Value &lt;= M_NUMBER_OF_LEVELS Specifies the valid transformation level. M_HORIZONTAL_LEVEL( MIL_INT Level ) Retrieves results about the horizontal wavelet coefficient, at the specified transformation level. Parameters Level Specifies the transformation level. 0 &lt; Value &lt;= M_NUMBER_OF_LEVELS Specifies the valid transformation level. M_VERTICAL_LEVEL( MIL_INT Level ) Retrieves results about the vertical wavelet coefficient, at the specified transformation level. Parameters Level Specifies the transformation level. 0 &lt; Value &lt;= M_NUMBER_OF_LEVELS Specifies the valid transformation level. M_APPROXIMATION Retrieves results about the approximation (the low frequency rendition) of the wavelet transformation at the last calculated level. For a 1D locate peak result, set this parameter to one of the following values. For specifying the index of the peak in the lane(s), for which to retrieve the 1D locate peak result Value Description M_NULL Specifies that no information is required for the Index1 parameter. This setting is only valid if you are retrieving the number of scan lanes (M_NUMBER_OF_SCAN_LANES) or when retrieving the initialization state of the result buffer with M_STATUS. M_SELECT_PEAK( MIL_INT Frame, MIL_INT Rank ) Specifies the frame(s) and rank of the peak(s) for which to return the requested result (for the lane(s) specified with the Index2 parameter). This macro is required if a MimLocatePeak1d() operation accumulated results from multiple frames in the result buffer (MimControl() with M_NUMBER_OF_FRAMES set to a value greater than 1). Parameters Frame Specifies the index of the frame(s) for which the result was stored. M_ALL Specifies all frames. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the index of the specific frame. Rank Specifies the peak(s) for which to return the requested result. M_ALL Specifies all peaks in the lane(s). Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the rank of the specific peak in the lane(s). M_ALL Retrieves the requested result for all peaks in the scan lane(s) specified using the Index2 parameter. If peaks are absent from a lane, MIL skips it unless M_INCLUDE_MISSING_DATA is specified. Ordering of the results is dependent on MimControl() with M_SORT_CRITERION. Note that this setting is equivalent to using the M_SELECT_PEAK() macro above, with the Frame and Rank parameters set to 0 and M_ALL, respectively. 0 &lt;= Value &lt; M_NUMBER + M_INCLUDE_MISSING_DATA Specifies the rank of the peak for which to retrieve the requested result, for the scan lane(s) specified using the Index2 parameter. Ordering of the results is dependent on MimControl() with M_SORT_CRITERION. If the peak is absent from the lane, MIL skips it, unless M_INCLUDE_MISSING_DATA is specified. Index2 Specifies the second index for which to retrieve results. For a wavelet transformation result, this information is not required; set this parameter to M_NULL. For a 1D locate peak result, set this parameter to one of the following values. For specifying the index of the lane for which to retrieve the 1D locate peak result Value Description M_NULL Specifies that no information is required for the Index2 parameter. For a 1D locate peak result, this setting is only valid if you are retrieving the number of scan lanes (M_NUMBER_OF_SCAN_LANES) or when retrieving the initialization state of the result buffer with M_STATUS. M_ALL Specifies to retrieve the requested result for all scan lanes. If the specified peak(s) are absent from a lane, MIL skips it unless M_INCLUDE_MISSING_DATA is specified. Ordering of the results is dependent on MimControl() with M_SORT_CRITERION. 0 &lt;= Value &lt; M_NUMBER_OF_SCAN_LANES Specifies the lane for which to retrieve the requested result. If the specified peak(s) are absent from a lane, MIL skips it unless M_INCLUDE_MISSING_DATA is specified. Empty elements are added after the other elements, at the end of the returned array. Ordering of the results is dependent on MimControl() with M_SORT_CRITERION. ResultType Specifies the type of result to retrieve. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. UserArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] array of type MIL_FLOAT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_FLOAT&gt; ] array of type MIL_ID [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_ID&gt; ] array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] array of type MIL_INT32 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT32&gt; ] array of type MIL_INT64 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT64&gt; ] MIL_DOUBLE MIL_FLOAT MIL_ID MIL_INT MIL_INT32 MIL_INT64 Specifies the address of the one-dimensional array in which to write the results read from the MIL result buffer.

For example, if you use M_WAVELET_COEFFICIENTS_IMAGE_ID with the Index1 parameter set to M_DIAGONAL_LEVEL(3), you will retrieve the identifier of the internal image buffer that holds the diagonal wavelet coefficient at level three. The type and depth (per band) of the data in each internal wavelet buffer is 32-bit floating-point. There is a separate internal image buffer for every wavelet coefficient result, at every level, and for each numerical domain. You can specify the domain by combining M_WAVELET_COEFFICIENTS_IMAGE_ID with M_REAL_PART (the default) or M_IMAGINARY_PART. To display an internal image buffer, you must inquire its system using MbufInquire() with M_OWNER_SYSTEM, and allocate a display on it using MdispAlloc().

Syntax void MimHistogram( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;HistResultImId //in ) Description This function calculates the histogram (or pixel intensity distribution) of the specified source image and stores the results in the specified result buffer. You can control the bin size of the calculated histogram, and the number of smoothing iterations to perform on it, by calling MimControl() with M_HIST_BIN_SIZE_MODE and M_HIST_SMOOTHING_ITERATIONS. By default, a histogram has 1 value per bin, and has not been smoothed. To read the resulting histogram values from the result buffer, use MimGetResult1d() or MimGetResult(), and specify M_CUMULATIVE_VALUE, M_HIST_..., M_PERCENTILE_VALUE, or M_VALUE as the result type. You can limit this function's results to a region of an image buffer using a region of interest (ROI) set using MbufSetRegion(). The ROI must be defined in raster format (M_RASTER or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error is generated if the ROI is only in vector format (M_VECTOR). Parameters Parameters SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source image buffer. The image buffer must be 1-band. Buffer data will be treated as unsigned, if MimControl() with M_HIST_BIN_SIZE_MODE is set to M_DEFAULT or M_REGULAR. That is, floating-point values will be cast to MIL_UINT values before generating the histogram. In this case, unexpected results can occur if a floating-point value exceeds the MIL_UINT range. Signed buffers are remapped in the result such that the minimum value is 0, if you set M_HIST_BIN_SIZE_MODE to M_FIT_SRC_DATA, M_FIT_SRC_RANGE, or M_FREEDMAN. 8-, 16-, and 32-bit source image buffers are supported, unless you set M_HIST_BIN_SIZE_MODE to M_FREEDMAN. In this case, 8- and 16-bit source image buffers are supported. If you specify an image buffer that has an ROI associated with it, the ROI must be in raster format; otherwise, you will get an error. HistResultImId Specifies the identifier of the destination for the histogram results. This parameter must be given the identifier of an image processing result buffer that was allocated with MimAllocResult() and has an M_HIST_LIST type. If the result buffer has fewer entries than the full range of source values, the pixel values that are out of range will not be included in the histogram. If, however, the result buffer has more entries than the full range of source values, the entries that are out of range will have an undetermined value. Compilation information Header Include mil.h.

Syntax void MimHistogramEqualize( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Operation, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Alpha, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Min, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Max //in ) Description This function performs a histogram equalization of the specified source image. Results are written to a destination buffer, which can be either an image buffer or a LUT buffer. This function first performs a histogram of the source image buffer. The histogram is then used to calculate a transformation LUT that can be used to enhance the source image (with MimLutMap()). If the destination buffer is a LUT, the transformation LUT is copied into the destination LUT. If the destination buffer is an image, the source buffer is remapped through the transformation LUT to produce the destination image. Note that floating-point values will be cast to MIL_UINT32 values before performing the histogram. Therefore, unexpected results can occur if a floating-point value is larger than the MIL_UINT32 range. You can limit this function's results to a region of an image buffer using a region of interest (ROI) set using MbufSetRegion(). The ROI must be defined in raster format (M_RASTER or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error is generated if the ROI is only in vector format (M_VECTOR). If you specify multiple image buffers with an ROI, this function performs a histogram using the source ROI, and writes to the destination only those pixels that intersect between the source ROI and the destination ROI. This is consistent with the behavior of this function when ROIs are not specified. If MimHistogramEqualize() is not producing the results you expect, try performing an adaptive histogram equalization, using MimHistogramEqualizeAdaptive()). Though an adaptive histogram equalization can take longer to execute (more calculations to process), it can help minimize the over-amplification of noise and the potential for saturation. Unlike MimHistogramEqualize(), MimHistogramEqualizeAdaptive() is not available with MIL-Lite. Parameters Parameters SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the data source of the operation. This parameter will be treated as an unsigned image buffer identifier. If you specify an image buffer that has an ROI associated with it, the ROI must be in raster format; otherwise, you will get an error. DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination of the results. This parameter must be given an image buffer or LUT buffer identifier. If you specify an image buffer that has an ROI associated with it, the ROI must be in raster format; otherwise, you will get an error. Operation Specifies the equalization operation to perform. This parameter can be set to one of the following values. Note that the cumulative probability distribution, Pf(f), of the input image is approximated by its cumulative histogram: Refer to \"Pratt, William K. Digital Image Processing . United States: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1978. 318.\".

Output probability density model: Transfer function: M_HYPER_CUBE_ROOT Specifies an equalization density function which generates a Hyperbolic Cube Root distribution. Output probability density model: Transfer function: M_HYPER_LOG Specifies an equalization density function which generates a Hyperbolic Logarithmic distribution. Output probability density model: Transfer function: M_RAYLEIGH Specifies an equalization density function which generates a Rayleigh distribution. Output probability density model: Transfer function: M_UNIFORM Specifies an equalization density function which generates a Uniform distribution. Output probability density model: Transfer function: Alpha Specifies the value to use for alpha (a) in the equations for M_EXPONENTIAL and M_RAYLEIGH. For other Operation parameter values, set Alpha to M_NULL. For specifying the alpha value Value Description Value &gt; 0 Specifies the value to use for alpha (a). For an M_EXPONENTIAL operation, a greater alpha value yields a lower occurrence of the most frequent pixels of the histogram in the resulting image buffer. When operating on an 8-bit unsigned image, a typical value for alpha is between 0.001 and 0.1. For an M_RAYLEIGH operation, the greater the alpha is, the greater the occurrence of the most frequent pixels of the histogram in the resulting image buffer. When operating on an 8-bit unsigned image, a typical value for alpha is between 10 and 1000. Min Specifies the lowest pixel value to equalize. For specifying the lowest pixel value to equalize Value Description Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the lowest pixel value. Max Specifies the highest pixel value to equalize.

Syntax void MimHistogramEqualizeAdaptive( MIL_ID&nbsp;AdaptiveEqualizeContextImId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function enhances the contrast of the specified source image by applying a Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). The resulting image is placed in the destination image buffer. This function first partitions the specified source image into a set of rectangular sections of equal size, referred to as tiles, and calculates histograms for each one. The histograms are then used to transform the image and produce an enhanced (equalized) version of it. By default, MimHistogramEqualizeAdaptive() uses 8 tiles along the image's X- and Y-direction. To modify the number of tiles, call MimControl() with M_NUMBER_OF_TILES_X and M_NUMBER_OF_TILES_Y. Though MimHistogramEqualizeAdaptive() can take longer to execute than a conventional histogram equalization (MimHistogramEqualize()), it can help minimize the over-amplification of noise and the potential for saturation, particularly in images with inconsistent lighting where some sections are significantly brighter than others. By default, the maximum percentage of pixels that can be represented by a histogram bin is limited to 1% of all the pixels in its respective tile. Exceeding values are distributed evenly among that histogram's other bins. To modify this behavior, use the M_CLIP_LIMIT control. You can also modify the number of histogram bins for each tile, as well as the equalization operation performed, using the M_HIST_SIZE and M_OPERATION controls. By default, MimHistogramEqualizeAdaptive() determines the number of histogram bins automatically according to the specified source image and performs a uniform-type of equalization. You can limit this function's results to a region of an image buffer using a region of interest (ROI) set using MbufSetRegion(). The ROI must be defined in raster format (M_RASTER or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error is generated if the ROI is only in vector format (M_VECTOR). If you specify multiple image buffers with an ROI, results are limited to the portion of the ROIs that intersect. Parameters Parameters AdaptiveEqualizeContextImId Specifies the identifier of the adaptive histogram equalization context. The context must have been allocated using MimAlloc() with M_HISTOGRAM_EQUALIZE_ADAPTIVE_CONTEXT. SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source image buffer. The buffer must be a 1-band, 8- or 16-bit image buffer allocated using MbufAlloc...() with M_IMAGE + M_PROC. The type of the source image buffer must be the same as the destination image buffer. To inquire this information, use MbufInquire() with M_TYPE. DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer. The buffer must be a 1-band, 8- or 16-bit image buffer allocated using MbufAlloc...() with M_IMAGE + M_PROC. The type of the destination image buffer must be the same as the source image buffer. To inquire this information, use MbufInquire() with M_TYPE. If you specify an image buffer that has an ROI associated with it, the ROI must be in raster format; otherwise, you will get an error.

Syntax void MimLabel( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ProcMode //in ) Description This function labels all objects (or blobs) in the specified source image, starting from the top-left corner, with unique consecutive values beginning with the value 1. Each pixel in the same blob is given the same numerical value. If you want to distinguish between touching blobs, you should separate the blobs. For example, you can use an erosion operation before performing the labeling operation. Parameters Parameters SrcImageBufId Specifies identifier of the data source of the operation. This parameter must be given an image buffer identifier. If the source buffer is not binary, all non-zero pixels are considered as part of an object or blob. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination of the results. This parameter must be given an image buffer identifier. The destination buffer should be large enough to hold the maximum number of objects (blobs). For example, an 8-bit buffer can be used for a maximum of 254 blobs and a 16-bit buffer can be used for a maximum of 65534 blobs). If the destination buffer depth is too small, several blobs might be given the same value. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. ProcMode Specifies the type of connectivity (lattice) to use for processing. This parameter can be set to one of the following values: For specifying the type of connectivity to use Value Description M_4_CONNECTED Specifies that each pixel has 4 neighbors. If two blobs touch on the vertical and horizontal axis, they are considered one blob. M_8_CONNECTED Specifies that each pixel has 8 neighbors. If two blobs touch on the vertical, horizontal, or diagonal, they are considered one blob. Combination values for any of the possible values of the ProcMode parameter. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to specify the processing mode. For the ProcMode parameter Combination value Description M_BINARY Specifies the binary processing mode. If the source image is a binarized image (containing 0 or the maximum value of the buffer, achieved for example with MimBinarize() or MimBinarizeAdaptive()), you can add M_BINARY to the connectivity mode to accelerate processing, particularly if the labeling is done by the Host. M_GRAYSCALE Specifies the grayscale processing mode. This is the default value. Remark In-place processing is supported, but the source and destination image buffers cannot partially overlap (a situation that can only occur when using child buffers).

If the result buffer does not have the required number of entries to hold the total number of events that satisfy the condition, the number returned will be limited to the number of entries in the result buffer. You can limit this function's results to a region of the source image buffer using a region of interest (ROI) set using MbufSetRegion(). Parameters Parameters SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source image for the operation. This parameter must be given the identifier of a 1-band buffer. This image buffer can have an ROI set using MbufSetRegion(). The ROI must be defined in raster format (M_RASTER or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error is generated if the ROI is only in vector format (M_VECTOR). EventResultImId Specifies the identifier of the buffer in which to store the event results. This parameter must be given the identifier of an image processing result buffer, allocated using MimAllocResult() with an M_EVENT_LIST type. The buffer must have enough entries to hold the expected number of events. If the number of pixels found is less than the number of event result buffer entries, the remaining result buffer entries are set to M_INVALID. If the number of events is greater than the number of allocated result buffer entries, the extra entries are discarded; when using multi-processing, the events kept might not be the first events in the source image. To determine the number of events so that you can allocate an appropriate result buffer, call MimLocateEvent() with EventResultImId set to M_NULL. The returned value is the number of pixels that satisfy the condition. Use this value to allocate a result buffer of the correct size. You then call this function a second time, specifying a result buffer with the correct size. Condition Specifies the condition under which pixel values are considered an event. This parameter must be set to one of the values below. For conditions that use two limits, set the Condition parameter to one of the values below. For conditions that use two limits Value Description M_IN_RANGE Specifies that pixels with values between CondLow and CondHigh, inclusive, are considered events. M_OUT_RANGE Specifies that pixels with values less than CondLow, or greater than CondHigh, are considered events. For conditions that use one limit, set the Condition parameter to one of the values below. For conditions that use one limit Value Description M_EQUAL Specifies that only pixels with values equal to CondLow will be considered an event. M_GREATER Specifies that only pixels with values greater than CondLow will be considered an event. M_GREATER_OR_EQUAL Specifies that only pixels with values greater than or equal to the CondLow will be considered an event. M_LESS Specifies that only pixels with values less than CondLow will be considered an event. M_LESS_OR_EQUAL Specifies that only pixels with values less than or equal to CondLow will be considered an event. M_NOT_EQUAL Specifies that only pixels with values not equal to CondLow will be considered an event. For conditions that use no limit, set the Condition parameter to the value below. Typically, this is only useful when specifying a local maxima or local minima condition. For conditions that use no limit Value Description M_ALL Specifies that all pixels satisfying the local maxima or local minima condition will be considered an event. If you do not specify a local maxima or local minima condition, M_ALL results in the coordinates and value of all the source pixels. Combination values for M_IN_RANGE , M_GREATER_OR_EQUAL , M_LESS_OR_EQUAL , M_ALL. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to specify a local maxima or local minima as part of the condition under which pixel values are considered an event. The local maxima or local minima condition only applies to pixels that meet the initial condition (for example, M_IN_RANGE). For specifying a local maxima or local minima as part of the condition Combination value Description M_LOCAL_MAX_NOT_STRICT Specifies that within a 3x3 neighborhood of a pixel, the pixel must be equal to or greater than all of its neighbors for it to be considered an event. =&lt; =&lt; =&lt; =&lt; X =&lt; =&lt; =&lt; =&lt; The following is an example that shows a pixel, at the center of its 3x3 neighborhood, that satisfies the M_LOCAL_MAX_NOT_STRICT condition. 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 M_LOCAL_MAX_STRICT_MEDIUM Specifies that within a 3x3 neighborhood of a pixel, the pixel must be equal to or greater than all of its neighbors, and it must also be greater than the pixels on its left and the pixel below, for it to be considered an event. &lt; =&lt; =&lt; &lt; X =&lt; &lt; &lt; =&lt; The following is an example that shows a pixel, at the center of its 3x3 neighborhood, that satisfies the M_LOCAL_MAX_STRICT_MEDIUM condition. 4 5 5 4 5 5 4 4 5 M_LOCAL_MIN_NOT_STRICT Specifies that within a 3x3 neighborhood of a pixel, the pixel must be equal to or less than all of its neighbors for it to be considered an event. =&gt; =&gt; =&gt; =&gt; X =&gt; =&gt; =&gt; =&gt; The following is an example that shows a pixel, at the center of its 3x3 neighborhood, that satisfies the M_LOCAL_MIN_NOT_STRICT condition. 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 M_LOCAL_MIN_STRICT_MEDIUM Specifies that within a 3x3 neighborhood of a pixel, the pixel must be equal to or less than all of its neighbors, and it must also be less than the pixels on its left and the pixel below, for it to be considered an event. &gt; =&gt; =&gt; &gt; X =&gt; &gt; &gt; =&gt; The following is an example that shows a pixel, at the center of its 3x3 neighborhood, that satisfies the M_LOCAL_MIN_STRICT_MEDIUM condition. 5 4 4 5 4 4 5 5 4 CondLow Specifies the lower limit of the selected condition. For specifying the lower limit Value Description M_NULL Specifies that no lower limit is required. This setting should be selected for conditions that use M_ALL. Value Specifies the lower limit. CondHigh Specifies the upper limit of the selected condition. For specifying the upper limit Value Description M_NULL Specifies that no upper limit is required. This setting should be selected for conditions that use one limit or M_ALL. Value Specifies the upper limit. Return value If EventResultImId is M_NULL, the returned value is the number of pixels that satisfy the specified condition in the specified source image. If EventResultImId is not M_NULL, the returned value is M_INVALID. In that case, use either MimGetResult() or MimGetResult1d(), with M_NB_EVENT as the result type, to retrieve the number of pixels that satisfy the specified condition.

      "text": " MimLocatePeak1d Synopsis Performs peak intensity detection in every lane (row or column) of the source image. Syntax void MimLocatePeak1d( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;ResultId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;PeakWidthNominal, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;PeakWidthDelta, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;MinContrast, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;ControlValue //in ) Description This function detects the position and the intensity of a peak in every lane (row or column) of an image. It is well suited for applications that generate 3D data based on laser line or sheet of light profiling. The function iterates through each lane. For each lane, the function determines the pixels that are in the peak neighborhood, as defined by PeakWidthNominal, PeakWidthDelta, and MinContrast. For each such region, it finds the position of the highest intensity with sub-pixel accuracy, and calculates the average intensity around that position. The position can be retrieved in a fixed-point representation, with 0 to 7 fractional bits. For optimal performance, preprocess the result buffer by calling MimLocatePeak1d() with M_PREPROCESS. You can choose to preprocess with or without an image. When preprocessing with an image, specify a typical image in the series of images that you will process with MimLocatePeak1d(). The preprocessed image's size and bit depth are stored. When preprocessing without an image (SrcImageBufId set to M_NULL), you must specify the number of scan lanes in a typical image in the series with ControlFlag. When preprocessing without an image, it is assumed that all images are 8-bit unsigned. If the preprocess operation is not done explicitly (using M_PREPROCESS), MimLocatePeak1d() will preprocess the result buffer internally when it is first called. If a new image in the series has a different size or bit depth than the image used to preprocess, MimLocatePeak1d() will preprocess the result buffer again, given the new image's characteristics. In a noisy image, or any image that might have multiple peaks in a single lane, such as when the object or surface is highly reflective, MimLocatePeak1d() can record the position and intensity of multiple peaks in a lane. You can create a custom application that sifts through the multiple peaks in each lane to determine the best peak in the lane for your needs. To record multiple peaks in a lane, use MimControl() with M_NUMBER_OF_PEAKS set to the maximum number of peaks to record. For more information, see the Multiple peaks in a single lane subsection of the Peak intensity detection and depth maps section of Chapter 5: Specialized image processing. You can retrieve the calculated results from the result buffer using MimGetResultSingle(). MimLocatePeak1d() can accumulate results from multiple frames in one result buffer. To do so, you must set MimControl() with M_NUMBER_OF_FRAMES, which is the maximum number of frames for which results can be accumulated in the result buffer. When calling MimLocatePeak1d(), set M_FRAME_INDEX to the appropriate index in the result buffer which corresponds to the frame for which to store results. MimLocatePeak1d() supports multi-frame image buffers. When passing a multi-frame image buffer, you must set MimControl() with M_FRAME_SIZE to the Y-size of each individual frame. For information on multi-frame image buffers, see the Specifying the dimensions of a multi-frame image buffer subsection of the Specifying the dimensions of a data buffer section of Chapter 23: Data buffers. Note that the total number of frames (M_NUMBER_OF_FRAMES) can be different from the frame capacity of the source image buffer. For example, if the source image buffer has a 5-frame capacity and you have 10 total frames to process, 2 calls to MimLocatePeak1d() can be done before calling MimGetResultSingle(). Typically, you would set M_FRAME_INDEX to frame 0 on the first call to MimLocatePeak1d(); then, set it to frame 5 on the second call. Finally, it is important to set M_FRAME_INDEX such that the result buffer can hold all results produced from the call. That is, there must be enough indices available in the result buffer to accommodate results from all frames in the source image buffer. For more information on peak extraction from a multi-frame image buffer, see the Extraction of peaks from a multi-frame buffer subsection of the Peak intensity detection and depth maps section of Chapter 5: Specialized image processing. For results obtained from laser line images, you can draw an uncorrected depth map or intensity map using MimDraw() with M_DRAW_DEPTH_MAP_ROW or M_DRAW_INTENSITY_MAP_ROW, respectively. For more information, see the Generating an uncorrected depth map subsection of the Peak intensity detection and depth maps section of Chapter 5: Specialized image processing. To verify that the peak was found at the right location, you can draw the calculated peak intensities at the calculated positions into an image buffer using MimDraw() with M_DRAW_PEAKS. Parameters Parameters ContextId Specifies the identifier of the image processing context. The image processing context must have been previously allocated using MimAlloc() with M_LOCATE_PEAK_1D_CONTEXT. SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source image buffer. Note that this function only supports 8- and 16-bit unsigned source image buffers. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. This image buffer must not have an associated camera calibration context. Using an image buffer with an associated camera calibration context will cause an error. When preprocessing (M_PREPROCESS), you can specify an image in the series, or you can set this parameter to M_NULL. ResultId Specifies the identifier of the image processing result buffer in which to store results. The result buffer must have been allocated using MimAllocResult() with M_LOCATE_PEAK_1D_RESULT. PeakWidthNominal Specifies the nominal (expected average) width of the peak neighborhood. In laser line images, this is the average width of the laser line. For specifying the nominal width of the peak Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies to use the value of the control type M_PEAK_WIDTH_NOMINAL, set using MimControl(). The default value of M_PEAK_WIDTH_NOMINAL is 20. M_NULL Specifies to ignore this parameter. This setting should be used exclusively when ControlFlag is set to M_PREPROCESS; this is the only possible setting in this case. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the average width, in pixels. PeakWidthDelta Specifies the number of pixels that can be added to or subtracted from the nominal width, when determining the range of allowable widths of the peak neighborhood. PeakWidthNominal plus PeakWidthDelta defines the maximum width of the peak neighborhood. PeakWidthNominal minus PeakWidthDelta defines the minimum width of the peak neighborhood. For specifying the variance of the width of the peak Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies to use the value of the control type M_PEAK_WIDTH_DELTA, set using MimControl(). The default value of M_PEAK_WIDTH_DELTA is 20. M_NULL Specifies to ignore this parameter. This setting should be used exclusively when ControlFlag is set to M_PREPROCESS; this is the only possible setting in this case. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the maximum amount of variance from the nominal width, in pixels. MinContrast Specifies the minimum contrast (difference) between the intensity of the local background and the minimum acceptable intensity of pixels in the peak neighborhood. For specifying the contrast that defines the peak Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies to use the value of the control type M_MINIMUM_CONTRAST, set using MimControl(). The default value of M_MINIMUM_CONTRAST is 100. M_NULL Specifies to ignore this parameter. This setting should be used exclusively when ControlFlag is set to M_PREPROCESS; this is the only possible setting in this case. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 65534 Specifies the minimum difference in intensity. Note that the default value is 100, regardless of the bit depth of the image. To keep the default functionality in a 16-bit image, set this value to 25,600. ControlFlag Specifies whether to explicitly preprocess the image processing result buffer; or specifies a frame index for which to extract peaks. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ControlValue Specifies the required value for the ControlFlag setting. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Parameter associations The table below lists possible values for the ControlFlag and ControlValue parameters. For specifying preprocessing or for specifying the frame index into which peaks will be extracted The following ControlFlag and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to control preprocessing and for specifying the frame index. For specifying preprocessing or for specifying the frame index into which peaks will be extracted ControlFlag Description ControlValue M_DEFAULT Specifies to perform the peak intensity detection on the specified image. When the specified image processing result buffer has not been preprocessed or has been preprocessed with an image that has different characteristics than SrcImageBufId, (for instance, size or bit depth), MimLocatePeak1d() will automatically preprocess the image processing result buffer before performing the peak intensity detection. If a multi-frame image buffer is used (MimControl() with M_FRAME_SIZE not set to M_FULL_SIZE), peak extraction begins at the first frame (frame 0). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default behavior. M_FRAME_INDEX Specifies the frame index in the M_LOCATE_PEAK_1D_RESULT result buffer into which extractions will be accumulated. If processing a multi-frame image buffer, this sets the first frame index in the result buffer into which extractions will be accumulated. When accumulating results from multiple calls to MimLocatePeak1d(), set M_FRAME_INDEX to the appropriate index in the result buffer. If using a multi-frame image buffer, specify a frame index that is subsequent to the frames processed in the preceding call, so as not to overwrite previous results. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. 0 &lt;= Value &lt; M_NUMBER_OF_FRAMES Specifies the frame index into which peaks will be accumulated. M_PREPROCESS Specifies to preprocess the specified image processing result buffer. When M_PREPROCESS is specified, set PeakWidthNominal, PeakWidthDelta, and MinContrast to M_NULL. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default behavior, when preprocessing with a source image. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the number of scan lanes in subsequent source images, when preprocessing without an image (ControlFlag set to M_PREPROCESS and SrcImageBufId set to M_NULL).

Syntax void MimLutMap( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;LutBufId //in ) Description This function maps each pixel in the specified source image to values determined by the specified lookup table (LUT). If the source image is signed, negative numbers are treated as unsigned values and address the LUT accordingly. For example, -1 is represented as 0xff for 8-bit image data and 0xffff for 16-bit image data and will therefore address LUT entry 0xff or 0xffff, respectively. You can limit this function's results to a region of an image buffer using a region of interest (ROI) set using MbufSetRegion(). The ROI must be defined in raster format (M_RASTER or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error is generated if the ROI is only in vector format (M_VECTOR). If you specify multiple image buffers with an ROI, results are limited to the portion of the ROIs that intersect. Parameters Parameters SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the data source of the operation. This parameter must be given an image buffer identifier. If you specify an image buffer that has an ROI associated with it, the ROI must be in raster format; otherwise, you will get an error. DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination of the results. This parameter must be given an image buffer identifier. If you specify an image buffer that has an ROI associated with it, the ROI must be in raster format; otherwise, you will get an error. LutBufId Specifies the LUT through which to map source input values. This parameter must be given a valid LUT buffer identifier. If the LUT has fewer entries than the full range of source values, unexpected results will occur. If the LUT buffer depth is greater than that of the destination buffer, results will be truncated to fit the destination buffer. LUT entries must have been previously initialized (for example, using MgenLutRamp() or MbufPut1d()).

Syntax void MimMatch( MIL_ID&nbsp;MatchContextImId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function generates a series of correlation values (match scores) resulting from the model image being compared to every pixel in your image. The MimMatch() operation results in an image of correlation data. The closer the resulting pixel value is to the specified maximum score, the closer the match between the source image buffer and the model image. This function uses a match image processing context to match a pixel in the source image with a given model image. Specify the model image using MimControl() with M_MODEL_IMAGE. You can also specify the algorithm to use to perform the correlation (the mode), using MimControl() with M_MODE. In addition, you can limit the region in the model image with which to perform the correlation, using a mask image; specify the mask image using MimControl() with M_MASK_IMAGE. In the match mask image, all non-zero pixels are considered mask pixels that are ignored during the match. When dealing with large images, you can reduce the number of comparisons performed from 1 every pixel to 1 every other pixel in your model image, using MimControl() with M_MODEL_STEP. Before you call this function to perform a match operation, preprocess the match image processing context by calling MimMatch() with M_PREPROCESS. If the preprocess operation is not done explicitly (using M_PREPROCESS), it will be done when MimMatch() is first called. When preprocessed explictly, the source and destination image buffers can be set to M_NULL. If, however, the source or destination image buffer is provided, it will be used in the preprocess operation, to better optimize future calls. Parameters Parameters MatchContextImId Specifies the identifier of the match image processing context. The context must have been allocated using MimAlloc() with M_MATCH_CONTEXT. In addition, the match image processing context must already be configured with the identifier of the model image. SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source image buffer. The buffer must be an 8-bit unsigned image buffer. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. When preprocessing the match image processing context, set this parameter to a typical source image buffer. To exclude this buffer from preprocessing, set this parameter to M_NULL. DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer. The buffer must be either a 16-bit signed or a 32-bit floating-point image buffer. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. When preprocessing the match image processing context, set this parameter to a typical destination image buffer. To exclude this buffer from preprocessing, set this parameter to M_NULL. ControlFlag Specifies the operation to perform. This parameter must be set to one of the following values. For specifying the operation to perform. Value Description M_DEFAULT Performs the match operation according to the settings of the match image processing context. M_PREPROCESS Preprocess the specified image processing context.

Syntax void MimMorphic( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcContainerOrImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstContainerOrImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;StructElemBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Operation, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;NbIterationOrArea, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ProcMode //in ) Description This function performs one of several morphological transformations on the specified source image or depth map container, using a user-defined or predefined structuring element. If the source and destination are multi-band buffers, the same structuring element is applied to every band of the source buffer. If the source is a depth map container, invalid pixels are copied unchanged into the destination buffer. Also, for the supported operations, the M_GRAYSCALE processing mode is used. Parameters Parameters SrcContainerOrImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source image buffer or depth map container. For specifying the source image buffer or depth map container identifier Value Description Source depth map container identifier Specifies the identifier of the source depth map container. The depth map container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must store data in a 3D-processable depth map format (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE). Source image buffer identifier Specifies the identifier of the source image buffer. The image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. DstContainerOrImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination buffer in which to put the result of the operation. If SrcContainerOrImageBufId is an image buffer, this parameter must be given an image buffer identifier. If SrcContainerOrImageBufId is a depth map container, this parameter must be given the identifier of a depth map image buffer or depth map container. For specifying the destination image buffer, depth map image buffer, or depth map container identifier Value Description Destination depth map container identifier Specifies the identifier of the destination depth map container. The depth map container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, must store data in a 3D-processable depth map format (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE), and must not be a child container. Destination depth map image buffer identifier Specifies the identifier of the destination depth map image buffer. The depth map image buffer must be a 1-band, 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit unsigned image buffer with the same dimensions (SizeX and SizeY) as the source depth map container's range component. It must be 3D-corrected (that is, if you call McalInquire() with M_DEPTH_MAP, the function returns M_TRUE), and must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Destination image buffer identifier Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer. The image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. StructElemBufId Specifies the structuring element to use. For all operations except area opening and area closing operations, you must specify the identifier of the structuring element buffer which defines the required structuring element. For M_AREA_OPEN or M_AREA_CLOSE operations, you must specify either an M_3X3_CROSS or an M_3X3_RECT structuring element. Note that these predefined structuring elements are not available for any other type of operation. For specifying the structuring element Value Description M_3X3_CROSS Specifies a cross (+) structuring element whose neighborhood size is 3x3 pixels. In this case, there are 5 valid neighborhood pixels; the function ignores the pixels located at the four corners of the neighborhood. M_3X3_RECT Specifies a structuring element whose neighborhood size is 3x3 pixels. In this case, there are 9 valid neighborhood pixels. MIL structuring element buffer identifier Specifies a custom structuring element to use, allocated using MbufAlloc...() with an M_STRUCT_ELEMENT attribute. This structuring element should be loaded with structuring-element values, using MbufPut(). These values can be set to M_DONT_CARE to specify that the corresponding source image pixels should not be taken into account during the operation. You can set the overscan type and the center of the structuring element, using MbufControl(). For window leveling operations, the structuring element buffer must contain only 0 or M_DONT_CARE values. The center structuring element value must not be a M_DONT_CARE value. When the source is a depth map container, the structuring element buffer must contain only 0 or M_DONT_CARE values. The center structuring element value must be 0 (to avoid introducing new invalid pixels). For M_BOTTOM_HAT, M_CLOSE, M_OPEN, and M_TOP_HAT operations, the structuring element value at position Size - Center - 1 must also be 0, since it will be the center of the second operation. Operation Specifies the operation to perform. Supported operations are given in the table below. For specifying the type of operation to perform Value Description MIL system-specifictooltip () M_AREA_CLOSE Specifies an area close operation. Note that this operation is only available when the source is an image buffer.  M_AREA_OPEN Specifies an area open operation. Note that this operation is only available when the source is an image buffer.  M_BOTTOM_HAT Specifies a bottom-hat operation. This operation is the equivalent to a close operation (M_CLOSE), followed by a subtraction of the source from the results.  M_CLOSE Specifies a close operation. This operation is equivalent to a dilation followed by an erosion.  M_DILATE Specifies a dilation operation. When performing a binary dilation, if any of the structuring element values match the corresponding neighborhood values, the center pixel is set to the maximum value of the buffer (for example, 0xff for an 8-bit buffer); otherwise, it remains unchanged. In effect, binary dilation adds layers to the objects. When performing a grayscale dilation, this operation adds each structuring element value to the corresponding pixel value in the neighborhood, and then replaces the center pixel of the neighborhood with the maximum value from the resulting neighborhood values. The pixels that correspond to M_DONT_CARE in the structuring element are ignored.  M_ERODE Specifies an erosion operation. When performing a binary erosion, if the structuring element does not match the corresponding neighborhood values exactly, the center pixel is set to zero; otherwise, it remains unchanged. In effect, binary erosion peels off layers of objects. When performing a grayscale erosion, this operation subtracts each structuring element value from the corresponding pixel value in the neighborhood, and then replaces the center pixel of the neighborhood with the minimum value from the resulting neighborhood values. The pixels that correspond to M_DONT_CARE in the structuring element are ignored.  M_HIT_OR_MISS Specifies a hit or miss transformation. Note that this operation is only available when the source is an image buffer.  M_LEVEL Specifies a window leveling operation on a pixel neighborhood basis. This operation finds the minimum and maximum pixel values in a neighborhood, and then creates a linear mapping such that these map to the minimum and maximum possible values of the image buffer. It then replaces the center pixel of the neighborhood with its corresponding value in the mapping. If the destination image buffer is a floating-point buffer, each pixel will be set to a value between 0 and 1. The pixels that correspond to M_DONT_CARE in the structuring element are ignored.

Alternatively, this function can generate the X- and Y-coordinate LUTs required to perform the transformation using MimWarp(). For a rectangular-to-polar transformation, the zone of interest to convert is based on a circle centered at CenterPosX and CenterPosY, with the part to convert having the specified start and end radius (StartRadius and EndRadius) and specified start and end angle (StartAngle and EndAngle), measured with respect to the X-axis of the image. The result will be mapped to the destination buffer as follows: The increment in angle is determined by the length, in pixels, of the outside arc, calculated as follows: (endangle - startangle) / arclength. A polar-to-rectangular transform performs the reverse of the transform described above. It takes a polar buffer and maps it to a rectangular buffer. Use the CenterPosX, CenterPosY, StartAngle, EndAngle, StartRadius, EndRadius parameters to specify where in the destination buffer the contents of the polar buffer will be mapped. To determine the required size of the destination image or LUT buffer, call the function with DstImageOrYLutBufId set to M_NULL; in this case, DstSizeXPtr and DstSizeYPtr will return the required X- and Y- size of the buffer, respectively. Note that DstSizeXPtr and DstSizeYPtr will return MIL_DOUBLE values; to allocate an appropriate buffer using these values, you should use a ceiling function, such as ceil(), to obtain the X- and Y- sizes as integer (MIL_INT) values. Parameters Parameters SrcImageOrDstXLutBufId Specifies the identifier of the source image buffer or the destination X-coordinate LUT buffer. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. DstImageOrYLutBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer or the Y-coordinate LUT buffer. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. CenterPosX Specifies the X-coordinate of the circle's center in the rectangular image. CenterPosY Specifies the Y-coordinate of the circle's center in the rectangular image. StartRadius Specifies the start radius of the zone of interest in the circle, in pixels. EndRadius Specifies the end radius of the zone of interest in the circle, in pixels. StartAngle Specifies the start angle of the zone of interest. The scan starts at this angle. For specifying the starting angle Value Description -360.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 720.0 Specifies the start angle. If the start angle (StartAngle) is less than the end angle (EndAngle), the direction of the scan will be counter clockwise. If the start angle is greater than the end angle, the direction of the scan will be clockwise. There is no maximum span limit between StartAngle and EndAngle. EndAngle Specifies the end angle of the zone of interest. The scan ends at this angle. For specifying the ending angle Value Description -360.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 720.0 Specifies the end angle. If the end angle (EndAngle) is greater than the start angle (StartAngle), the direction of the scan will be counter clockwise. If the end angle is less than the start angle, the direction of the scan will be clockwise. There is no maximum span limit between StartAngle and EndAngle. OperationMode Specifies the transform to perform. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. InterpolationMode Specifies the interpolation mode and overscan used when transforming the source image. When generating the LUTs to perform the transformation, this parameter is ignored and should be set to M_DEFAULT. This parameter must be set to one of the values below. For specifying the interpolation mode used in the conversion Value Description MIL system-specifictooltip () M_DEFAULT Specifies the default interpolation mode and overscan. When transforming the source image, the default is the same as M_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR + M_OVERSCAN_ENABLE. When only generating the LUTs to perform the transformation, this is the only possible value.  M_BICUBIC Specifies bicubic interpolation. The new value is determined by taking a weighted average of the 16 values (4x4) that surround the source point. Note that the sum of the weights used for bicubic interpolation might be greater than one. If this occurs and the result reflects an overflow or underflow, the result is saturated according to the depth and data type of the destination buffer.  M_BILINEAR Specifies bilinear interpolation. The new value is determined by taking a weighted average of the 4 values (2x2) that surround the source point.  M_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR Specifies nearest neighbor interpolation. The new value is that of the pixel closest to the source point.  Combination values for any of the possible values of the InterpolationMode parameter. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to specify how to determine the value of a destination pixel when its associated point falls outside the source buffer. For specifying how to determine the value of a destination pixel when its associated point falls outside the source buffer Combination value Description MIL system-specifictooltip () M_OVERSCAN_CLEAR Sets the destination pixel to 0.  M_OVERSCAN_DISABLE Leaves the destination pixel as is.  M_OVERSCAN_ENABLE Uses pixels from the source buffer's ancestor buffer. If the source buffer is not a child buffer or if the point falls outside the ancestor buffer, leave the destination pixel as is. This is the default value.  MIL system specific Points falling outside the source image are undefined.  M_OVERSCAN_FAST Specifies that MIL will automatically select the overscan that optimizes speed, according to the specified operation and the target system. The overscan could be hardware-specific thereby having a different behavior than the other supported overscan modes. Note that when using M_OVERSCAN_FAST, the destination pixels in the overscan area are undefined. The pixels can therefore contain different values from one function call to the next, even if the function's parameter values are the same.  DstSizeXPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which the required width of the destination buffer is written. If you don't need this information, set this parameter to M_NULL. DstSizeYPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which the required height of the destination buffer is written. If you don't need this information, set this parameter to M_NULL.

You can add the following value to the above-mentioned values to specify the number of fractional bits in the coordinates of the source point. For generating LUTs Combination value Description M_FIXED_POINT + n Specifies the number of fractional bits for the source point ( x s , y s ). To do so, add the define M_FIXED_POINT + n to M_POLAR_TO_RECTANGULAR_LUT or M_RECTANGULAR_TO_POLAR_LUT where n &gt;= 0. If nothing is added to M_POLAR_TO_RECTANGULAR_LUT or M_RECTANGULAR_TO_POLAR_LUT, it is assumed that there are no fractional bits in the coordinates of the source point.

It replaces each pixel with the pixel in its neighborhood whose value is the specified rankth value relative to others. It uses the specified structuring element as a mask. This mask determines the neighborhood size and which pixels in the neighborhood to ignore. Parameters Parameters SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the data source of the operation. This parameter must be given an image buffer identifier. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination of the resulting image. This parameter must be given an image buffer identifier. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. StructElemBufId Specifies the identifier of the structuring element buffer to use as a mask. You can either define a custom structuring element as a mask or use a predefined mask buffer. For the structuring element buffer Value Description MIL system-specifictooltip () M_3X3_CROSS Applies a cross (+) mask and sets the neighborhood size to 3x3 pixels. In this case, there are 5 valid neighborhood pixels; the cross mask makes the function ignore the pixels located at the four corners of the neighborhood.  M_3X3_RECT Applies no mask and sets the neighborhood size to 3x3 pixels. In this case, there are 9 valid neighborhood pixels.  M_5X5_RECT Applies no mask and sets the neighborhood size to 5x5 pixels. In this case, there are 25 valid neighborhood pixels.  MIL structuring element buffer identifier Applies a mask specified by the custom structuring element, having been previously allocated with MbufAlloc...() with an M_STRUCT_ELEMENT attribute. This structuring element is to be loaded with structuring-element values, using MbufPut(). The structuring element buffer dimensions are used as the neighborhood size. Values in the structuring element set to M_DONT_CARE represent neighborhood pixels not to be considered in the ranking operation. All other values in the structuring element must be set to 1, representing neighborhood pixels to be considered in the ranking operation.  Combination values for M_3X3_CROSS , M_3X3_RECT , M_5X5_RECT. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to specify the overscan settings to use for the operation. For specifying the overscan setting Combination value Description MIL system-specifictooltip () M_OVERSCAN_DISABLE Specifies to disable overscanning for this operation. You should disable overscanning to accelerate the operation for applications in which the overscan data is not important in the resulting buffer.  M_OVERSCAN_ENABLE Specifies to enable overscanning for this operation. The overscan uses pixels from the ancestor of the source buffer. If the source buffer is not a child buffer, or if the point falls outside the ancestor buffer, a mirror type overscan is used. A mirror overscan specifies that the overscan pixels will be a mirror copy of the source buffer's border pixels. This is the default value.  M_OVERSCAN_FAST Specifies that MIL will automatically select the overscan that optimizes speed, according to the specified operation and the target system. The overscan could be hardware-specific thereby having a different behavior than the other supported overscan modes. Note that when using M_OVERSCAN_FAST, the destination pixels in the overscan area are undefined. The pixels can therefore contain different values from one function call to the next, even if the function's parameter values are the same.  Rank Specifies which of the pixel values to select after valid neighborhood values are sorted in increasing order; valid neighborhood pixel values are those that are not masked-out. For specifying which pixel to select Value Description M_MEDIAN Specifies that MimRank() performs a median filter (that is, each pixel is replaced with the median neighborhood value). 0 &lt; Value &lt;= number of valid neighborhood pixels Specifies the rank of the pixel value to select. If the number of valid pixels is less than the given rank, the number of valid pixels is used as the rank. ProcMode Specifies the processing mode to use. This parameter can be set to one of the following: For specifying the processing mode to use Value Description M_BINARY Treats non-zero pixels as ones (1) during processing. The resulting non-zero pixels will have all bits set to one. M_GRAYSCALE Uses the source image's gray values for processing. The resulting buffer will also contain gray values.

Syntax void MimRearrange( MIL_ID&nbsp;RearrangeContextImId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function copies specified areas of a source buffer to specified areas of a destination buffer. The rest of the source image buffer is ignored and not copied. Before using this function, you must configure the specified image processing context with which operation to perform, using MimControl() with M_MODE. This specifies whether to copy rectangular areas or rows of the source buffer. In addition, you must specify the offsets and sizes of the source and destination areas, using MimPut() with M_XY_SOURCE, M_XY_DESTINATION, and M_XY_SIZE. Note that each array in the rearrangement image processing context must have the same number of elements. The source and destination image buffers need not be of the same size, but must be equal to or larger than the largest supplied source and destination coordinates. Once the rearrangement image processing context is configured, preprocess the context by calling MimRearrange() with M_PREPROCESS. If the preprocess operation is not done explicitly (using M_PREPROCESS), it will be done when MimRearrange() is first called. When preprocessing explicitly, the source and destination image buffers can be set to M_NULL. If, however, the source or destination image buffer is provided, it will be used in the preprocess operation, to better optimize future calls. Parameters Parameters RearrangeContextImId Specifies the identifier of the rearrangement image processing context that indicates how to perform the operation and the locations to copy. This context should be previously allocated using MimAlloc() with M_REARRANGE_CONTEXT. SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source image buffer. If preprocessing the rearrangement image processing context (using M_PREPROCESS), set this parameter to the identifier of a typical source image buffer. Otherwise, to exclude this buffer from preprocessing, set this parameter to M_NULL. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer. If preprocessing the rearrangement image processing context (using M_PREPROCESS), set this parameter to the identifier of a typical destination image buffer. Otherwise, to exclude this buffer from preprocessing, set this parameter to M_NULL. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it.

For specifying the operation to perform Value Description M_DEFAULT Performs the rearrangement operation. M_PREPROCESS Preprocesses the specified image processing context. Note that, if not called explicitly, this operation will be performed automatically upon the first call to MimRearrange().

Syntax void MimRemap( MIL_ID&nbsp;RemapContextImId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function performs window leveling by linearly remapping source pixels to destination pixels according to the specified mode. By default, MIL performs remapping calculations using the possible minimum and maximum values of the full value range of the specified destination image buffer. You can also use a custom remap image processing context and specify different values. When using a custom remap image processing context, you can choose the range of source pixel values that are remapped, using MimControl() with M_SRC_START_VALUE and M_SRC_END_VALUE, as well as the range of destination pixel values to which they are remapped using M_DST_START_VALUE and M_DST_END_VALUE. By default, MIL determines the remapping for the destination image buffer. However, when not using a remap image processing context, you can specify to remap the values such that the value zero in the source buffer maps to the value zero in the destination buffer with M_CENTERED. Note that saturation can occur when M_CENTERED is specified. Parameters Parameters RemapContextImId Specifies the identifier of a remap image processing context. If a custom remap image processing context is not used, this parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. For specifying the remap context identifier Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies a linear remapping from source pixel to corresponding destination pixel. Note, MIL performs remapping calculations using the possible minimum and maximum values of the specified destination image buffer. By default, this is the full value range according to the buffer type. To control these values, use MbufControl() with M_MIN and M_MAX. For the source image buffer, the minimum and maximum values used for calculations depend on the specified remapping mode (ControlFlag). Remap image processing context ID Specifies the identifier of a remap image processing context, previously allocated using MimAlloc() with M_IM_REMAP_CONTEXT. SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source image buffer. The image buffer must be a 1-band or 3-band float, signed, or unsigned buffer. If the image buffer has a region of interest (ROI) associated with it, the ROI must be in M_RASTER or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER format. Using an image buffer with an M_VECTOR ROI will cause an error. DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer. If the image buffer has a region of interest (ROI) associated with it, the ROI must be in M_RASTER or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER format. Using an image buffer with an M_VECTOR ROI will cause an error. ControlFlag Specifies the remapping mode. When using a custom remap image processing context, this parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. For specifying the remapping method to perform Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value. When using the default remap image processing context, the default remapping mode is M_FIT_SRC_RANGE. When using a custom remap image processing context, this is the only possible setting. Use MimControl() with M_SRC_RANGE to specify how the source range is established. M_FIT_SRC_DATA Specifies to remap according to the source data. The true minimum and maximum pixel values will be calculated from the source image buffer using MimFindExtreme(). M_FIT_SRC_RANGE Specifies to remap according to the minimum and maximum pixel values specified for the source image buffer (MbufControl() with M_MIN and M_MAX). By default, this is the full value range according to the buffer type. If the source buffer has data below the specified M_MIN or above the specified M_MAX, this data will be mapped to unpredictable values. If the goal is to clip this data to the M_MIN and M_MAX values of the destination buffer, use MimClip() with M_OUT_RANGE on the source buffer first to set the data outside the range to the specified source M_MIN and M_MAX values. Combination value for M_FIT_SRC_DATA , M_FIT_SRC_RANGE. You can add the following value to the above-mentioned values to specify to keep the range centered to zero.

Alternatively, this function can generate the 3x3 or 3x2 matrix required to perform the transformation using MimWarp(). Parameters Parameters SrcImageBufId Specifies the source image to resize if performing the transformation. This parameter can be set to one of the following values: For specifying the source image buffer identifier Value Description M_NULL Specifies to ignore this parameter; this parameter must be set to M_NULL when generating the matrix that you can use with MimWarp() to perform the resizing. MIL image buffer identifier Specifies the identifier of the source image buffer to resize. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. DstImageOrArrayBufId Specifies the destination image buffer or array buffer, depending on whether performing the transformation. This parameter can be set to one of the following values: For specifying the destination buffer identifier Value Description MIL array buffer identifier Specifies the identifier of the destination M_ARRAY buffer when generating the matrix. When generating a warp matrix, this parameter must be given a single-band, 32-bit floating-point buffer that has an M_ARRAY attribute and that has dimensions 3x2, for a first-order polynomial warping, or 3x3, for a perspective polynomial warping. If you pass this parameter a buffer with dimensions 3x2, MimWarp() will assume the third row to be (0, 0, 1) when performing the warping. MIL image buffer identifier Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer when resizing the source image. This buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using a buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Note that after performing the operation, the destination image will not be calibrated, even if the source image was calibrated. ScaleFactorX Specifies the horizontal scaling factor. This parameter can be set to one of the values below. For specifying the scaling factor (width) Value Description M_FILL_DESTINATION Specifies to use a scaling factor that resizes the source image to fill the entire width of the destination buffer. When set to M_FILL_DESTINATION, the source image is resized to fill the entire width of the destination buffer. You can only use this value when resizing an image. In this case, you must pass SrcImageBufId a source image buffer identifier, and not M_NULL. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the horizontal scaling factor. A value greater than 1.0 enlarges the source image, while a factor less than 1.0 reduces it. You must specify a specific value for the horizontal scaling factor when only generating the matrix to perform the transformation. ScaleFactorY Specifies the vertical scaling factor. This parameter can be set to one of the values below. For specifying the scaling factor (height) Value Description M_FILL_DESTINATION Specifies to use a scaling factor that resizes the source image to fill the entire height of the destination buffer. When set to M_FILL_DESTINATION, the source image is resized to fill the entire height of the destination buffer. You can only use this value when resizing an image. In this case, you must pass SrcImageBufId a source image buffer identifier, and not M_NULL. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the vertical scaling factor. A value greater than 1.0 enlarges the source image, while a factor less than 1.0 reduces it. You must specify a specific value for the vertical scaling factor when only generating the matrix to perform the transformation. InterpolationMode Specifies the interpolation mode when resizing the source image. When only generating the matrix, this parameter is ignored and should be set to M_DEFAULT. This parameter can be set to one of the values below. For specifying the mode of interpolation Value Description MIL system-specifictooltip () M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value. When resizing the source image, the default is the same as M_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR + M_OVERSCAN_ENABLE. When only generating the coefficients matrix, this is the only possible value.  M_AVERAGE Specifies averaging interpolation. The scaling factors for the width and height of the source image must be less than or equal to 1.  M_BICUBIC Specifies bicubic interpolation. The new value is determined by taking a weighted average of the 16 values (4x4) that surround the source point. Note that the sum of the weights used for bicubic interpolation might be greater than one. If this occurs and the result reflects an overflow or underflow, the result is saturated according to the depth and data type of the destination buffer.  M_BILINEAR Specifies bilinear interpolation. The new value is determined by taking a weighted average of the 4 values (2x2) that surround the source point.  M_INTERPOLATE Specifies interpolated resizing. For resizing up, this is equivalent to bilinear; for resizing down, this is equivalent to averaging. This gives the best speed/result compromise for interpolated resizing.  M_MAX Specifies an interpolation based on the maximum pixel value in the specified source image. The scaling factors for the width and height of the source image must be less than or equal to 1.  M_MIN Specifies an interpolation based on the minimum pixel value in the specified source image. The scaling factors for the width and height of the source image must be less than or equal to 1.  M_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR Specifies nearest neighbor interpolation. The new value is that of the pixel closest to the source point.  Combination values for any of the possible values of the InterpolationMode parameter. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to specify how to determine the value of a destination pixel when its associated point falls outside the source buffer. For overscan Combination value Description MIL system-specifictooltip () M_OVERSCAN_CLEAR Sets the destination pixel to 0.  M_OVERSCAN_DISABLE Leaves the destination pixel as is.  M_OVERSCAN_ENABLE Uses pixels from the source buffer's ancestor buffer. If the source buffer is not a child buffer or if the point falls outside the ancestor buffer, it leaves the destination pixel as is. This is the default value.  MIL system specific Points falling outside the source image are undefined.  M_OVERSCAN_FAST Specifies that MIL will automatically select the overscan that optimizes speed, according to the specified operation and the target system. The overscan could be hardware-specific thereby having a different behavior than the other supported overscan modes. Note that when using M_OVERSCAN_FAST, the destination pixels in the overscan area are undefined. The pixels can therefore contain different values from one function call to the next, even if the function's parameter values are the same.  Remark In-place processing is supported, but the source and destination image buffers cannot partially overlap (a situation that can only occur when using child buffers).

Syntax MIL_ID MimRestore( MIL_CONST_TEXT_PTR&nbsp;FileName, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*ContextImIdPtr //out ) Description This function restores an image processing context that was previously saved to a file using MimSave() or MimStream(). This function restores all of the image processing context's settings that were in effect when the image processing context was saved. Note that this function allocates the image processing context for you. To load an image processing context into an existing image processing context, allocate the context using MimAlloc() and then use MimStream() with M_LOAD. When the restored image processing context is no longer required, release it using MimFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during allocation; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the restored image processing context's lifetime and you must not manually free it. Parameters Parameters FileName Specifies the name and path of the file from which to restore the image processing context. The function handles (internally) the opening and closing of the file. This parameter can be set to one of the following: For specifying the file name and path Value Description M_INTERACTIVE [This is only applicable to Windows] Opens the File Open dialog box from which you can interactively specify the drive, directory, and name of the file. MIL_TEXT(\"FileName\") 1 Specifies the drive, directory, and name of the file (for example, \"C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). Typically, image processing context files have an MIC extension. To specify a file on a remote computer (under Distributed MIL), prefix the specified file name string with \"remote:///\" (for example, \"remote:///C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). 1 If you are passing the value in a variable, don't enclose it in MIL_TEXT(). SysId Specifies the system on which to restore the image processing context. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the system identifier Value Description M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. ContextImIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the image processing context identifier or specifies the data type that the function should use to return the restored image processing context identifier. For retrieving the identifier or specifying how to return it Value Description M_NULL Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated image processing context ; in this case, a standard MIL identifier of type MIL_ID is returned. M_UNIQUE_ID Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated image processing context ; in this case, a MIL smart identifier of type MIL_UNIQUE_IM_ID is returned instead of a standard MIL identifier. This setting is only available when using C++11 (or later). A MIL smart identifier manages the lifespan of the MIL object it owns (similar to a std::unique_ptr). Note, you can use a MIL smart identifier as though it were a standard MIL identifier, except that you cannot use it to manually free the image processing context (it is freed automatically). For more information, see the MIL smart identifiers subsection of the MIL custom data types, void pointers, extensions, and portability functions section of Chapter 2: Building an application. Address in which to write the identifier Specifies the address of a MIL_ID in which to write the identifier of the restored image processing context. If allocation fails, M_NULL is written as the identifier. Return value The returned value is the restored image processing context identifier either as a standard identifier (MIL_ID) or a smart identifier (MIL_UNIQUE_IM_ID).

Syntax void MimRotate( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageOrArrayBufId, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Angle, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;SrcCenX, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;SrcCenY, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;DstCenX, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;DstCenY, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;InterpolationMode //in ) Description This function rotates an image by the specified angle of rotation. Alternatively, this function can generate the 3x3 or 3x2 warp matrix required to perform the transformation using MimWarp(). If you specify a source image, it will be rotated using the specified interpolation mode. The center of rotation in the source image is determined by the specified X- and Y-source rotation-center coordinates. The rotated image will then be clipped to fit the destination buffer. It will be placed in the destination buffer with its center positioned at the specified X- and Y-destination center coordinates. Parameters Parameters SrcImageBufId Specifies the source image to rotate if performing the transformation. This parameter can be set to one of the following values: For specifying the source image buffer identifier Value Description M_NULL Specifies to ignore this parameter; this parameter must be set to M_NULL when generating the matrix that you can use with MimWarp() to perform the rotation. MIL image buffer identifier Specifies the identifier of the source image buffer to rotate. When rotating an image, this parameter must be given an image buffer identifier. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. DstImageOrArrayBufId Specifies the destination image buffer or array buffer, depending on whether performing the transformation. This parameter can be set to one of the following values: For specifying the destination buffer identifier Value Description MIL array buffer identifier Specifies the identifier of the destination M_ARRAY buffer when generating the matrix. When generating a warp matrix, this parameter must be given a single-band, 32-bit floating-point buffer that has an M_ARRAY attribute and that has dimensions 3x2, for a first-order polynomial warping, or 3x3, for a perspective polynomial warping. If you pass this parameter a buffer with dimensions 3x2, MimWarp() will assume the third row to be (0, 0, 1) when performing the warping. MIL image buffer identifier Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer when rotating the source image. When rotating an image, this parameter must be given an image buffer identifier. This buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using a buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Note that after performing the operation, the destination image will not be calibrated, even if the source image was calibrated. Angle Specifies the angle of rotation. For specifying the rotation angle Value Description -360.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 360.0 Specifies the angle of rotation, in degrees. When a positive angle is specified, the function rotates the image in a counter-clockwise direction, regardless of camera calibration settings. SrcCenX Specifies the X-coordinate to use as the center of rotation in the source image. This parameter must be set to one of the values below. For specifying the X-coordinate (source) Value Description M_DEFAULT Causes the image to rotate about its true center. When specifying M_DEFAULT as a center of rotation, it is computed as (source buffer size - 1) / 2. You can only use this value when rotating an image. In this case, you must pass SrcImageBufId a source image buffer identifier, and not M_NULL. Value Specifies the X-coordinate in the pixel coordinate system. You must specify a specific value for the X coordinate of the source buffer center when only generating the warp matrix to perform the transformation. SrcCenY Specifies the Y-coordinate to use as the center of rotation in the source image. This parameter must be set to one of the values below. For specifying the Y-coordinate (source) Value Description M_DEFAULT Causes the image to rotate about its true center. When specifying M_DEFAULT as a center of rotation, it is computed as (source buffer size - 1) / 2. You can only use this value when rotating an image. In this case, you must pass SrcImageBufId a source image buffer identifier, and not M_NULL. Value Specifies the Y-coordinate in the pixel coordinate system. You must specify a specific value for the Y coordinate of the source buffer center when only generating the warp matrix to perform the transformation. DstCenX Specifies the X-coordinate in the destination buffer to which the specified center of the rotated source image will be mapped. This parameter must be set to one of the values below. For specifying the X-coordinate (destination) Value Description M_DEFAULT Causes the true center of the destination buffer to be used. When specifying M_DEFAULT as a center of rotation, it is computed as (destination buffer size - 1) / 2. You can only use this value when rotating an image. In this case, you must pass SrcImageBufId a source image buffer identifier, and not M_NULL. Value Specifies the X-coordinate in the pixel coordinate system. You must specify a specific value for the X coordinate of the destination buffer center when only generating the warp matrix to perform the transformation. DstCenY Specifies the Y-coordinate in the destination buffer to which the specified center of the rotated source image will be mapped. This parameter must be set to one of the values below. For specifying the Y-coordinate (destination) Value Description M_DEFAULT Causes the true center of the destination buffer to be used. When specifying M_DEFAULT as a center of rotation, it is computed as (destination buffer size - 1) / 2. You can only use this value when rotating an image. In this case, you must pass SrcImageBufId a source image buffer, and not M_NULL. Value Specifies the Y-coordinate in the pixel coordinate system. You must specify a specific value for the Y coordinate of the destination buffer center when only generating the warp matrix to perform the transformation. InterpolationMode Specifies the interpolation mode when rotating the source image. When only generating the matrix, this parameter is ignored and should be set to M_DEFAULT. This parameter must be set to one of the values below. For specifying the interpolation mode Value Description MIL system-specifictooltip () M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value. When rotating the source image, the default is the same as M_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR + M_OVERSCAN_ENABLE. When only generating the coefficients matrix, this is the only possible value.  M_BICUBIC Specifies bicubic interpolation. The new value is determined by taking a weighted average of the 16 values (4x4) that surround the source point. Note that the sum of the weights used for bicubic interpolation might be greater than one. If this occurs and the result reflects an overflow or underflow, the result is saturated according to the depth and data type of the destination buffer.  M_BILINEAR Specifies bilinear interpolation. The new value is determined by taking a weighted average of the 4 values (2x2) that surround the source point.  M_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR Specifies nearest neighbor interpolation. The new value is that of the pixel closest to the source point.  Combination values for any of the possible values of the InterpolationMode parameter. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to specify how to determine the value of a destination pixel when its associated point falls outside the source buffer. For overscan Combination value Description MIL system-specifictooltip () M_OVERSCAN_CLEAR Sets the destination pixel to 0.  M_OVERSCAN_DISABLE Leaves the destination pixel as is.  M_OVERSCAN_ENABLE Uses pixels from the source buffer's ancestor buffer. If the source buffer is not a child buffer or if the point falls outside the ancestor buffer, it leaves the destination pixel as is. This is the default value.  MIL system specific Points falling outside the source image are undefined.  M_OVERSCAN_FAST Specifies that MIL will automatically select the overscan that optimizes speed, according to the specified operation and the target system. The overscan could be hardware-specific thereby having a different behavior than the other supported overscan modes. Note that when using M_OVERSCAN_FAST, the destination pixels in the overscan area are undefined. The pixels can therefore contain different values from one function call to the next, even if the function's parameter values are the same.  Remark In-place processing is supported, but the source and destination image buffers cannot partially overlap (a situation that can only occur when using child buffers).

Syntax void MimShift( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;NbBitsToShift //in ) Description This function performs left or right bit-shifting on each pixel in the specified image. The shift operation is signed or unsigned depending on the source image buffer's data type. Note that floating-point values will be cast to MIL_UINT32 before performing the shift operation (except when shifting by 0). Therefore, unexpected results can occur if a floating-point value is larger than the MIL_UINT32 range. Note that, if you shift by 0, only a copy operation will be performed. You can limit this function's results to a region of an image buffer using a region of interest (ROI) set using MbufSetRegion(). The ROI must be defined in raster format (M_RASTER or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error is generated if the ROI is only in vector format (M_VECTOR). Parameters Parameters SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the data source of the operation. This parameter must be given an image buffer identifier. If you specify an image buffer that has an ROI associated with it, the ROI must be in raster format; otherwise, you will get an error.

      "text": " MimStatCalculate Synopsis Calculates and stores a variety of statistics from the specified source image(s). Syntax void MimStatCalculate( MIL_ID&nbsp;StatContextImId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;StatResultImId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function calculates a variety of statistics for the pixels in the source image(s). Results are stored in the specified statistics result buffer. The specified image processing context establishes which statistics to calculate. This function can take statistics for the specified image (M_STATISTICS_CONTEXT context) or it can accumulate statistics for each pixel across multiple images (M_STATISTICS_CUMULATIVE_CONTEXT context). For an M_STATISTICS_CONTEXT context, you can specify a condition that a pixel must satisfy to be included in the calculation using M_CONDITION. Co-occurrence statistics (M_STAT_GLCM...) ignore any specified condition. If you need to calculate one type of single-image statistic and don't need to specify a condition, you can use a predefined context; otherwise, use MimAlloc() to set up a custom context that you can control using MimControl(). You can read the statistics from the result buffer using MimGetResult() or MimGetResult2d(), depending on the statistical operation performed. You can also draw some statistical results, using MimDraw(). Once the statistics image processing context is configured, preprocess the context and result buffer by calling MimStatCalculate() with M_PREPROCESS. If the preprocess operation is not done explicitly (using M_PREPROCESS), it will be done when MimStatCalculate() is first called. When explicitly preprocessing a cumulative statistics image processing context and result buffer, the source image buffer can be set to M_NULL if you set the size that the source buffer will be, using MimControl() with M_SOURCE_SIZE_X and M_SOURCE_SIZE_Y. Note that providing the source image buffer better optimizes future calls. When working with an M_STATISTICS_CUMULATIVE_CONTEXT context, you can remove the calculated statistics associated with a specified source image from the result buffer by calling MimStatCalculate() with M_REMOVE. To reset the results generated from finding the extremes of each pixel's value (such as, M_STAT_MIN), use M_RESET_EXTREMES. To reset all the results in the result buffer, free it using MimFree(), and then allocate a new result buffer using MimAllocResult() with M_STATISTICS_RESULT. These actions apply to either context (M_STATISTICS_CONTEXT or M_STATISTICS_CUMULATIVE_CONTEXT). Note that when working with an M_STATISTICS_CUMULATIVE_CONTEXT context, your source images should have the same dimensions, so that statistics are calculated for the same pixel across the multiple images. For an M_STATISTICS_CONTEXT, you can limit some of this function's results to a region of an image buffer using a region of interest (ROI) set using MbufSetRegion(). The ROI must be defined in raster format (M_RASTER or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error is generated if the ROI is only in vector format (M_VECTOR). Not all statistical operations support ROIs; for a list of those that do, see MimControl(). Note that the M_STATISTICS_CUMULATIVE_CONTEXT context does not support ROIs. Parameters Parameters StatContextImId Specifies a statistics context, which determines the statistics to calculate. You can select the identifier of a previously allocated statistics context, or you can select a predefined statistics context to evaluate one type of single-image statistical calculation. The predefined statistics contexts do not need to be allocated. For specifying the statistics context, or specific statistic to calculate Value Description M_STAT_CONTEXT_MAX Specifies a predefined single-image statistics image processing context with all control types set to their default except for M_STAT_MAX, which is set to M_ENABLE. Use this predefined context to calculate the maximum pixel value of the source image. M_STAT_CONTEXT_MAX_ABS Specifies a predefined single-image statistics image processing context with all control types set to their default except for M_STAT_MAX_ABS, which is set to M_ENABLE. Use this predefined context to calculate the maximum absolute pixel value of the source image. M_STAT_CONTEXT_MEAN Specifies a predefined single-image statistics image processing context with all control types set to their default except for M_STAT_MEAN, which is set to M_ENABLE. Use this predefined context to calculate the mean pixel value of the source image. M_STAT_CONTEXT_MIN Specifies a predefined single-image statistics image processing context with all control types set to their default except for M_STAT_MIN, which is set to M_ENABLE. Use this predefined context to calculate the minimum pixel value of the source image. M_STAT_CONTEXT_MIN_ABS Specifies a predefined single-image statistics image processing context with all control types set to their default except for M_STAT_MIN_ABS, which is set to M_ENABLE. Use this predefined context to calculate the minimum absolute pixel value of the source image. M_STAT_CONTEXT_NUMBER Specifies a predefined single-image statistics image processing context with all control types set to their default except for M_STAT_NUMBER, which is set to M_ENABLE. Use this predefined context to calculate the number of valid pixels in the source image. This is mainly useful in the presence of a region. M_STAT_CONTEXT_STANDARD_DEVIATION Specifies a predefined single-image statistics image processing context with all control types set to their default except for M_STAT_STANDARD_DEVIATION, which is set to M_ENABLE. Use this predefined context to calculate the standard deviation of the pixel values of the source image. M_STAT_CONTEXT_SUM Specifies a predefined single-image statistics image processing context with all control types set to their default except for M_STAT_SUM, which is set to M_ENABLE. Use this predefined context to calculate the sum of the pixel values of the source image. M_STAT_CONTEXT_SUM_ABS Specifies a predefined single-image statistics image processing context with all control types set to their default except for M_STAT_SUM_ABS, which is set to M_ENABLE. Use this predefined context to calculate the sum of the absolute pixel values of the source image. M_STAT_CONTEXT_SUM_OF_SQUARES Specifies a predefined single-image statistics image processing context with all control types set to their default except for M_STAT_SUM_OF_SQUARES, which is set to M_ENABLE. Use this predefined context to calculate the sum of the squared pixel values of the source image. MIL statistics context identifier Specifies a statistics context identifier, previously allocated using MimAlloc() with M_STATISTICS_CONTEXT or M_STATISTICS_CUMULATIVE_CONTEXT. You can specify which statistics calculations are evaluated using MimControl(). SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source image buffer. The buffer used must be a 1-band image buffer. When preprocessing a cumulative statistics image processing context and result buffer, set this parameter to the identifier of a typical source image buffer. To exclude this buffer from preprocessing, set this parameter to M_NULL and set the height and width of the area in the source buffer for which you need statistics, using MimControl() with M_SOURCE_SIZE_X and M_SOURCE_SIZE_Y; otherwise, an error will occur. To process multiple images when performing a cumulative statistics operation, call MimStatCalculate() multiple times, each time with a different source image. Note that the source image must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI for a cumulative statistics operation will cause an error. An image buffer specified for a single-image statistics operation can have an ROI associated with it. The ROI must be in raster format; otherwise, you will get an error. Note that not all statistics operations support ROIs; for a list of those that do, see MimControl(). StatResultImId Specifies the identifier of the result buffer. The buffer must have been allocated using MimAllocResult() with M_STATISTICS_RESULT. ControlFlag Specifies the operation to perform on the source image. To specify the operation to perform Value Description M_DEFAULT Calculates the statistics specified using MimControl(), or in a predefined statistics context. This is the only valid option for a predefined statistics context. M_PREPROCESS Preprocesses the specified image processing context and image processing result buffer. Note that, if not called explicitly, this operation will be performed automatically upon the first call to MimStatCalculate(). If the identifier of the source image buffer is not set to M_NULL, information about the source image buffer will be used in the preprocessing operation. M_REMOVE Removes the results related to the specified source image. This removes the results of the calculations, performed on the specified source image, from the accumulated results in the result buffer. To reset the minimum and maximum statistical results, use M_RESET_EXTREMES. The minimum and maximum statistical results cannot be removed. Note that this value only works when dealing with a cumulative statistics context (M_STATISTICS_CUMULATIVE_CONTEXT). M_RESET_EXTREMES Resets the results generated from M_STAT_MIN, M_STAT_MIN_ABS, M_STAT_MAX, and M_STAT_MAX_ABS operations. Note that, when resetting the minimum and maximum results, the SrcImageBufId parameter is ignored. Note that this value only works when dealing with a cumulative statistics context (M_STATISTICS_CUMULATIVE_CONTEXT). Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; milim.lib.

To inquire the number of bytes necessary to save an image processing context to memory stream, you should first call this function (MimStream()) with M_INQUIRE_SIZE_BYTE. The content saved to memory stream is equivalent to the content saved to file. This function is equivalent to a file saved using MimSave(). You can use this and other MIL stream functions, for example, to save all required MIL objects, as well as any other custom data, for your application to a memory stream. Once in a memory stream, you can write the stream to a single file or transfer it over a network. You are responsible for concatenating the streams and for saving the stream to file. When saving an image processing context, all information about the previously allocated image processing context is saved. The content saved to memory stream is equivalent to the content saved to file. When loading or restoring an image processing context, all of the image processing context's settings that were in effect when the image processing context was saved will be restored. Note that, you can also restore an image processing context using MimRestore(). Using MimStream(), you can choose to save a backwards-compatible version of the image processing context, which will work using a version of MIL that is up to one major release older than the current version (depending on which version is specified). For example, if you allocate an image processing context using MIL 10.0 and save it to version 9.0, you can restore this context on a computer where MIL 9.0 is installed. However, all settings and features unique to the higher version will be ignored when restored using the lower version. Besides saving backwards-compatible versions, you can also load or restore image processing contexts saved using MIL version 9.0 or above. Settings that do not exist in the lower version will be filled with default values when the image processing context is loaded or restored. Parameters Parameters MemPtrOrFileName Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): MIL_TEXT_PTR [optionally, in C++: a reference to a MIL_STRING] Optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector of type MIL_UINT8 Specifies the file or memory stream.

When used with M_REVERSE, computes the real component of the transform from the magnitude and phase ( R = M cos(P) ). The result will be used to perform the reverse FFT. For a reverse FFT, SrcImageRBufId and SrcImageIBufId must contain the magnitude and phase of a forward transform, respectively. M_MAGNITUDE must be used with M_PHASE for a reverse FFT. For a forward FFT, DstImageIBufId can be set to M_NULL if M_MAGNITUDE is used without M_PHASE. M_MAGNITUDE can only be used in transforms processed with floating-point buffers.

M_NORMALIZE must be used with fixed-point arithmetic (all integer buffers) to avoid overflows. If M_NORMALIZE has been specified with the forward transform, then it must be specified for the reverse transform as well. M_PHASE Specifies whether to compute or use the phase. When used with M_FORWARD, computes the phase of the forward transform ( P = atan(I/R) ). The phase is returned in the DstImageIBufId buffer, thereby overwriting the imaginary component of the destination image. The phase is returned in the range of 0° to 360°. When used with M_REVERSE, computes the imaginary component of the transform from the magnitude and phase ( I = M sin(P) ). The result will be used to perform the reverse FFT. For a reverse FFT, SrcImageRBufId and SrcImageIBufId must contain the magnitude and phase of a forward transform, respectively. M_PHASE must be used with M_MAGNITUDE for a reverse FFT. For a forward FFT, DstImageRBufId can be set to M_NULL if M_PHASE is used without M_MAGNITUDE. M_PHASE can only be used in transforms processed with floating-point buffers. M_SATURATION Clips (saturates) the results of a reverse FFT according to the destination buffer's data type. M_SATURATION can only be used with a reverse FFT (M_FFT + M_REVERSE) operation which uses floating-point source buffers and integer destination buffers. Combination value for M_MAGNITUDE. You can add the following value to the above-mentioned value to specify that the magnitude of the forward FFT is scaled logarithmically. For M_MAGNITUDE Combination value Description MIL system-specifictooltip () M_LOG_SCALE Scales logarithmically the magnitude of the forward FFT to be in the range of 0-255.

You can add one or more of the following values to the above-mentioned values to specify the transform characteristics. For specifying the transform characteristics Combination value Description MIL system-specifictooltip () M_FAST_PHASE Performs faster phase computation. For a forward polar transformation, it uses a faster computation of the phase results but slightly less accurate. For a reverse polar transformation, it has no effect.  M_NORMALIZE_PHASE Rescales the phase results. For a forward polar transformation, it rescales the phase results to be in the range of 0.0-1.0. For a reverse polar transformation, SrcImageRBufId must contain the phase values in the range of 0.0-1.0. This value cannot be used in combination with M_NORMALIZE_PHASE_255.  M_NORMALIZE_PHASE_255 Rescales the phase results. For a forward polar conversion, it rescales the phase results to be in the range of 0-255. For a reverse polar transformation, SrcImageIBufId must contain the phase values in the range of 0-255. This value cannot be used in combination with M_NORMALIZE_PHASE.  M_SQUARE_MAGNITUDE Specifies that the magnitude values are returned or used squared. For a forward polar transformation, it gives the square of the magnitude results (that is, R 2 +I 2 ). For a reverse transformation, SrcImageRBufId must contain the magnitude values squared.  Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; milim.lib.

InterpolationMode Specifies the interpolation mode when translating the source image. When only generating the matrix, this parameter is ignored and should be set to M_DEFAULT. This parameter must be set to one of the values below. For specifying the interpolation mode Value Description MIL system-specifictooltip () M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value. When translating the source image, the default is the same as M_BILINEAR + M_OVERSCAN_ENABLE. When only generating the coefficient matrix, this is the only possible value.  M_BICUBIC Specifies bicubic interpolation. The new value is determined by taking a weighted average of the 16 values (4x4) that surround the source point. Note that the sum of the weights used for bicubic interpolation might be greater than one. If this occurs and the result reflects an overflow or underflow, the result is saturated according to the depth and data type of the destination buffer.  M_BILINEAR Specifies bilinear interpolation. The new value is determined by taking a weighted average of the 4 values (2x2) that surround the source point.  M_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR Specifies nearest neighbor interpolation. The new value is that of the pixel closest to the source point.  Combination values for any of the possible values of the InterpolationMode parameter. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to specify how to determine the value of a destination pixel when its associated point falls outside the source buffer. For overscan Combination value Description MIL system-specifictooltip () M_OVERSCAN_CLEAR Sets the destination pixel to 0.  M_OVERSCAN_DISABLE Leaves the destination pixel as is.  M_OVERSCAN_ENABLE Uses pixels from the source buffer's ancestor buffer. If the source buffer is not a child buffer or if the point falls outside the ancestor buffer, it leaves the destination pixel as is. This is the default value.  MIL system specific Points falling outside the source image are undefined.  M_OVERSCAN_FAST Specifies that MIL will automatically select the overscan that optimizes speed, according to the specified operation and the target system. The overscan could be hardware-specific thereby having a different behavior than the other supported overscan modes. Note that when using M_OVERSCAN_FAST, the destination pixels in the overscan area are undefined. The pixels can therefore contain different values from one function call to the next, even if the function's parameter values are the same.  Compilation information Header Include mil.h.

Syntax void MimWarp( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;WarpParam1BufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;WarpParam2BufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;OperationMode, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;InterpolationMode //in ) Description This function warps an image through either a 3x3 matrix-defined warping or LUTs. You can perform first-order polynomial warpings or perspective polynomial warpings using either a 3x3 coefficients matrix or lookup tables (LUTs). You can perform custom warpings using LUTs. A warping associates each pixel position of the destination buffer, (xd, yd ), with a specific point in the source buffer, (xs, ys ), and then determines the pixel value of (xd, yd ) from its associated point and from a specified interpolation mode. When performing a first-order polynomial warping, (xd, yd ) gets associated with (xs, ys ) through the following equations: x s = a0 x d + a1 y d + a2 y s = b0 x d + b1 y d + b2 When performing a perspective polynomial warping, (xd, yd ) gets associated with (xs, ys ) through the following equations: x s = (a0 x d + a1 y d + a2)/(c0 x d + c1 y d + c2) y s = (b0 x d + b1 y d + b2)/(c0 x d + c1 y d + c2) When performing a 3x3 matrix-defined warping, WarpParam1BufId specifies the required coefficients (a0...a2, b0...b2 ) or (a0...a2, b0...b2, c0...c2 ) and WarpParam2BufId must be set to M_NULL. The coefficients can be automatically generated using MgenWarpParameter() or can be user-supplied. When performing a warping using LUTs, xs is determined from (xd, yd ) through one LUT and ys is determined from (xd, yd ) through another LUT. In this case, WarpParam1BufId specifies the LUT for xs and WarpParam2BufId specifies the LUT for ys . The LUTs can be user-supplied or can be automatically generated from a 3x3 coefficient matrix (for a first-order or polynomial warping) using MgenWarpParameter(). Parameters Parameters SrcImageBufId Specifies the buffer on which to perform the warping. This buffer can be of any type. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. DstImageBufId Specifies the buffer in which to place the results of the warping. This buffer can be of any type. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Note that after performing the operation, the destination image will not be calibrated, even if the source image was calibrated. WarpParam1BufId Specifies the buffer containing the matrix coefficients or the LUT buffer from which x s is determined. When WarpParam1BufId specifies the (a0...a2, b0...b2 ) or (a0...a2, b0...b2, c0...c2 ) coefficients, the coefficients must be in a single-band, 32-bit floating-point buffer that has an M_ARRAY attribute and that has dimensions 3x2 or 3x3. The first row specifies the a n coefficients, the second row specifies the b n coefficients, and the third row specifies the c n coefficients. If the buffer is 3x2, the third row is assumed to be (0, 0, 1). When WarpParam1BufId specifies the LUT buffer from which x s is determined, the buffer must be a signed 16- or 32-bit integer buffer or a 32-bit floating-point buffer, have the same X and Y size as the destination image buffer, and have an M_LUT attribute. WarpParam2BufId Specifies the LUT buffer from which y s is determined. This buffer must be a signed 16- or 32-bit integer buffer or a 32-bit floating-point buffer, have the same X and Y size as the destination image buffer, and have an M_LUT attribute. If you are not using LUTs to perform the warping, set WarpParam2BufId to M_NULL. OperationMode Specifies the mode of operation. This parameter must be set to one of the values below. For specifying the mode of operation Value Description M_WARP_LUT Performs the warping through LUTs. M_WARP_POLYNOMIAL Performs the warping through a 3x3 coefficient matrix. This includes a first-order polynomial warping or a perspective polynomial warping. Note that with a perspective polynomial warping matrix, MimWarp() might return an error if the calculation of (c0xd+ c1yd+ c2) is 0 in the destination buffer, regardless of whether or not the matrix was generated using MgenWarpParameter(). Combination value for M_WARP_LUT. You can add the following value to the above-mentioned value to specify the number of fractional bits in the coordinates of the source point. For M_WARP_LUT Combination value Description M_FIXED_POINT + n Specifies the number of fractional bits for the source point ( x s , y s ). To do so, add the define M_FIXED_POINT + n to M_WARP_LUT where n &gt;= 0. If nothing is added to M_WARP_LUT, it is assumed that there are no fractional bits in the coordinates of the source point (and therefore interpolation is not required). InterpolationMode Specifies the interpolation mode. This parameter must be set to one of the values below. For specifying the interpolation mode Value Description MIL system-specifictooltip () M_DEFAULT Same as M_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR + M_OVERSCAN_ENABLE.  M_BICUBIC Specifies bicubic interpolation. The new value is determined by taking a weighted average of the 16 values (4x4) that surround the source point.

Alternatively, this function can transform the coordinates using the inverse of the specified matrix (M_FORWARD). When this function transforms the coordinates using the warping matrix as is (M_REVERSE), it is referred to as a reverse warping transformation because this is how MimWarp() associates each pixel position of its destination buffer, (xd, yd ), with a specific point in its source buffer, (xs, ys ). Therefore, you can use MimWarpList() to establish which points in a source image MimWarp() associates with destination pixels when using the same matrix. When this function transforms the coordinates using the inverse of the specified warping matrix (M_FORWARD), it is referred to as a forward warping transformation; you can use a forward warping transformation, for example, to see if a specific pixel in the source image of MimWarp() is actually mapped to a destination buffer pixel. You can only specify the coefficients for a 3x3 or 3x2 matrix; this allows you to perform a first-order polynomial warping or a perspective polynomial warping. Perform a first-order polynomial warping by passing a 3x3 matrix, where the third row has the coefficients [0,0,1], or by passing a 3x2 matrix, the last row is assumed to be [0,0,1]. Perform a perspective polynomial warping by passing a 3x3 matrix, where the third row does not have the coefficients [0,0,1]. The matrix is applied as follows: x d = (a0 x s + a1 y s + a2)/(c0 x s + c1 y s + c2) y d = (b0 x s + b1 y s + b2)/(c0 x s + c1 y s + c2) If a 3x2 matrix, or a 3x3 matrix whose third row has the coefficients of [0,0,1] is specified (for a first-order polynomial warping operation), the denominator resolves to 1, effectively leaving only the numerator. The coefficients can be automatically generated using MgenWarpParameter(), MimResize(), MimRotate(), or MimTranslate(), or can be user-established. Note that MimWarpList() will internally invert the coefficients matrix (a0...a2, b0...b2, c0...c2 ) for a forward transfomation (M_FORWARD). Parameters Parameters WarpParamBufId Specifies the buffer containing the warp matrix coefficients. The coefficients must be in a single-band, 32-bit floating-point buffer that has an M_ARRAY attribute and that has dimensions 3x2 or 3x3. The first row specifies the a n coefficients, the second row specifies the b n coefficients, and the third row specifies the c n coefficients. If the buffer is 3x2, the third row is assumed to be (0, 0, 1). TransformType Specifies the transformation type to perform the warping. For specifying the transformation type. Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_REVERSE. M_FORWARD Specifies to perform a forward transformation. A forward transformation uses the inverse of the specified warping matrix to transform the source X- and Y-coordinates. M_REVERSE Specifies to perform a reverse transformation. A reverse transformation uses the specified warping matrix as is to transform the source X- and Y-coordinates. NumPoints Specifies the number of points in the arrays. When using a standard vector (std::vector) overload function in C++, you can pass M_DEFAULT to this parameter and MIL will automatically determine the size based on the number of items in the vector passed to the SrcCoordXArrayPtr or SrcCoordYArrayPtr parameter. SrcCoordXArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumPoints) Specifies the address of the array that contains the source X-coordinates. SrcCoordYArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumPoints) Specifies the address of the array that contains the source Y-coordinates.

Syntax void MimWatershed( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;MarkerImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;MinVariation, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function performs a watershed transformation on the specified source buffer. The catchment basins of the source buffer can be determined from extrema (minima or maxima) in the source buffer and/or from a specified marker image. In the case when no marker image is specified, a valid catchment basin is determined from an extrema when the minimum variation in gray levels of an extremum's catchment basin is equal to or greater than the value specified by the MinVariation parameter. In the case when a marker image is specified, each marker of a marker image produces catchment basin(s) by forcing an extremum in the corresponding area(s) of the source buffer. There are two types of marker images: non-labeled and labeled. In a non-labeled marker image, each group of touching pixels with the value zero in the marker image (known as a marker) starts a catchment basin in the corresponding area of the source image. Specifically, each marker in the marker image forces a extremum in the corresponding area of the source image. Pixels in the marker image are considered touching if they are vertically, horizontally, or diagonally adjacent, that is, if they are \"8-connected\". Note that each catchment basin in the destination image is given a unique grayscale value, starting at 1. In a labeled marker image, a marker is a set of pixels that do not have to necessarily touch and that have all the same label value (pixel intensity). Each marker starts a catchment basin in the corresponding area of the source image and each catchment basin of the destination image is assigned the label value of the marker that generated it. Note that, in a labeled marker image, a marker can touch other markers, allowing you to specify adjacent catchment basins. Valid marker label values are 1 to 2 n - 2 (where n refers to the number of bits per pixel in the buffer). Pixels with the label value of zero are interpreted as the region of the image that is not a marker. Finally, pixels with the label value of 2 n - 1 are considered to be part of a \"don't care\" mask and are not processed, accelerating the watershed transformation. You can specify that the destination buffer contain one of the following: Watershed lines. The watershed lines are given the value 0 and all other pixels are given the maximum value in the destination buffer. Labeled catchment basins, without watershed lines. Each catchment basin is assigned a grayscale value greater or equal to 1. Labeled catchment basins and watershed lines. Each catchment basin is assigned a grayscale value greater or equal to 1. Watershed lines are given the value 0. For more information, see the Watershed transformations section of Chapter 4: Advanced image processing. Parameters Parameters SrcImageBufId Specifies the buffer on which to perform the transform. This buffer can be 8-bit or 16-bit, signed or unsigned. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. MarkerImageBufId Specifies the buffer to use as a marker image. This buffer can be 8-bit or 16-bit, signed or unsigned. If you are not using a marker image, set this parameter to M_NULL. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. The default marker image type is non-labeled. If you want to use a labeled marker image, you must add M_LABELED_MARKER to the ControlFlag parameter. DstImageBufId Specifies the buffer in which to place the results of the transformation. This buffer can be 8-bit or 16-bit, signed or unsigned. The destination buffer can hold 2 n - 5 catchment basins, where n refers to the number of bits per pixel in the buffer. Therefore, an 8-bit destination buffer can hold 251 catchment basins and a 16-bit destination buffer can hold 65531 catchment basins. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. MinVariation Specifies the minimum variation of gray-level of a catchment basin. This parameter must be set to one of the values below. For specifying the minimum variation of gray-level Value Description M_DEFAULT Produces a catchment basin from each extremum in the source buffer. Setting MinVariation to 1 will have the same effect. M_OFF Specifies that catchment basins will not be determined from extrema in the source buffer. Value Sets the minimum variation. ControlFlag Specifies how to perform the transformation. It can be set to any combination of the following seven sets of values below. It can also be set to M_DEFAULT, in which case the default value from each set is used (without M_SKIP_LAST_LEVEL, M_LABELED_MARKER and M_FILL_SOURCE). If no value from a set is specified, its default value is used. For specifying how to perform the transformation Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_WATERSHED + M_MINIMA_FILL + M_REGULAR + M_4_CONNECTED. M_BASIN Labels catchment basins. M_WATERSHED Calculates watershed lines. M_WATERSHED + M_BASIN Labels catchment basin and calculates watershed lines. Combination values for any of the possible values of the ControlFlag parameter. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to specify whether to use the source buffer's minima or maxima when determining catchment basins from extrema in the source buffer.

You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to specify how the watershed lines are drawn. For specifying how the watershed lines are drawn Combination value Description M_REGULAR Traces the watershed lines exactly. This is the default value. M_STRAIGHT_WATERSHED Forces the watershed lines to be straight. Note that selecting M_STRAIGHT_WATERSHED automatically selects the M_SKIP_LAST_LEVEL setting. Combination values for any of the possible values of the ControlFlag parameter. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to specify whether 4 or 8-connected watershed lines will be used. For specifying 4 or 8-connected watershed lines Combination value Description M_4_CONNECTED Uses 4-connected watershed lines. This is the default value.

You can add the following value to the above-mentioned values to specify that an extremum's zone of influence cannot extend past the minimum and maximum gray level. For preventing an extremum's zone of influence from extending past the minimum and maximum gray level Combination value Description M_SKIP_LAST_LEVEL Prevents an extremum's zone of influence from extending beyond Lmax - 1 (for a minimum) or Lmin - 1 (for a maximum), where Lmax is the maximum gray level in the image and Lmin is the minimum gray level. Combination value for any of the possible values of the ControlFlag parameter.

You can add the following value to the above-mentioned values to specify that any unwanted extrema from the source image is removed. It removes the extrema by filling the catchment basins of unwanted extrema until they become plateaus.

The source and destination can either both be an image or a wavelet result. This function supports in-place processing; you can specify the identifier of the same buffer for the source and the destination. To specify wavelet controls that can affect this function's results, use MimControl(). To specify wavelet controls that can affect this function's results, use MimControl(). If the destination of this function is a result, you can perform drawing operations with them, using MimDraw(). Parameters Parameters WaveletContextImId Specifies the identifier of a wavelet image processing context, when performing a wavelet denoising of an image. The context must have been allocated using MimAlloc() with either M_WAVELET_TRANSFORM_CONTEXT or M_WAVELET_TRANSFORM_CUSTOM_CONTEXT. When performing a wavelet denoising of a result, this information is not required; set this parameter to M_NULL. If you specify a wavelet context, it indicates the filter and mode that this function uses to perform the wavelet denoising. For an M_WAVELET_TRANSFORM_CONTEXT context type, you can set a predefined type of wavelet filter, using MimControl() with M_WAVELET_TYPE. The default is a Haar wavelet filter type. For an M_WAVELET_TRANSFORM_CUSTOM_CONTEXT context type, you must specify custom wavelet filters, using MimWaveletSetFilter(). For either type of context, the default mode is dyadic. To change this (for example, to specify undecimated), use the M_TRANSFORMATION_MODE control. To inquire about the information in a wavelet image processing context, call MimInquire(). For example, you can retrieve the identifier of the internal buffer containing the wavelet filter values (M_FILTER_..._ID). SrcImageBufOrWaveletResultImId Specifies the identifier of the source with which to perform the wavelet denoising. The identifier must be for an image buffer or a wavelet image processing result buffer. The image buffer can be of any type. The wavelet result buffer must have been allocated on the required system using MimAllocResult() with M_WAVELET_TRANSFORM_RESULT. It must hold MimWaveletTransform() results. To retrieve information about wavelet transformation results, use MimGetResult() and MimGetResultSingle(). If the source is an image buffer, the destination must be an image buffer of the same type. If the source is a wavelet result buffer, the destination must be a wavelet result buffer. If you specify an image buffer, there must not be a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. DstImageBufOrWaveletResultImId Specifies the identifier of the destination with which to perform the wavelet denoising. The identifier must be for an image buffer or a wavelet image processing result buffer. The image buffer can be of any type. The wavelet result buffer must have been allocated on the required system using MimAllocResult() with M_WAVELET_TRANSFORM_RESULT. If the destination is an image buffer, the source must be an image buffer of the same type. If the destination is a wavelet result buffer, the source must be a wavelet result buffer. If you specify an image buffer, there must not be a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Level Specifies the transformation level at which to perform the denoising. Set this parameter to one of the following: For specifying the transformation level Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the level information is not required. Only valid when the source is a result. Denoising is performed at the transformation level indicated in the result. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the level. Only valid when the source is an image. This function decomposes the image according to the specified number of levels, performs the denoising, and recomposes the image using the same number of levels. MIL establishes the maximum level to be the point at which denoising at subsequent levels does not provide relevant data. The maximum level depends on the source image and the wavelet image processing context. If the specified level exceeds the maximum level, MIL uses the maximum level. DenoisingType Specifies the type of wavelet process with which to perform the denoising. Set this parameter to one of the following: For specifying the wavelet shrinkage process Value Description M_BAYES_SHRINK Specifies predefined BayesShrink denoising techniques. Typically effective for minimizing Gaussian noise. M_NEIGH_SHRINK Specifies predefined NeighShrink denoising techniques. Typically effective when noise is difficult to characterize. Denoising mimics the general behavior of wavelet coefficients by taking neighborhood statistics and dismissing outliers. M_NEIGH_SHRINK is often faster than the other predefined denoising techniques, though results can be less precise. M_SURE_SHRINK Specifies predefined SureShrink denoising techniques. Typically effective for minimizing Mean Square Errors (MSE). ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. Compilation information Header Include mil.h.

Syntax void MimWaveletTransform( MIL_ID&nbsp;WaveletContextImId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufOrWaveletResultImId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufOrWaveletResultImId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;TransformType, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;Level, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function performs a forward or reverse wavelet transformation using the specified source buffer and places the results in the specified destination buffer. The source and destination can be an image or wavelet result. This function supports in-place processing; you can specify the identifier of the same buffer for the source and the destination. Wavelets refer to mathematical algorithms that process data in both the space and frequency domain, offering a compromise between each. By using wavelets, MimWaveletTransform() results can therefore represent space and frequency. This makes MimWaveletTransform() especially effective at filtering images. It is typically useful for signal coding, signal denoising, data compression, and pattern recognition. To specify wavelet controls that can affect MimWaveletTransform() results, use MimControl(). To perform drawing operations with this function's results, use MimDraw(). To retrieve information about a specific wavelet result, use MimGetResultSingle(). A specific wavelet result refers to a transformed rendition of the source, based on either a wavelet coefficient (diagonal, horizontal, or vertical) at a specific level, or on an approximation of the wavelet transformation. For general types of wavelet results, such as the actual number of transformation levels used, call MimGetResult(). Parameters Parameters WaveletContextImId Specifies the identifier of a wavelet image processing context. The context must have been allocated using MimAlloc() with M_WAVELET_TRANSFORM_CONTEXT or M_WAVELET_TRANSFORM_CUSTOM_CONTEXT. The context indicates the filter and mode that this function uses to perform its transformation. For an M_WAVELET_TRANSFORM_CONTEXT context type, you can set a predefined type of wavelet filter, using MimControl() with M_WAVELET_TYPE. The default is a Haar wavelet filter type. For an M_WAVELET_TRANSFORM_CUSTOM_CONTEXT context type, you must specify custom wavelet filters, using MimWaveletSetFilter(). For either type of context, the default transformation mode is dyadic. To change this (for example, to specify undecimated), use the M_TRANSFORMATION_MODE control. To inquire about the information in a wavelet image processing context, call MimInquire(). For example, you can retrieve the identifier of the internal buffer containing the wavelet filter values (M_FILTER_..._ID). SrcImageBufOrWaveletResultImId Specifies the identifier of the source with which to perform the wavelet transformation. The identifier must be for an image buffer or a wavelet image processing result buffer. The image buffer can be of any type. The wavelet result buffer must have been allocated on the required system using MimAllocResult() with M_WAVELET_TRANSFORM_RESULT. It must hold MimWaveletTransform() results. If the source is an image buffer, the destination must be a wavelet result buffer. If the source is wavelet result buffer, the destination can be an image or a wavelet result buffer. If you specify an image buffer, there must not be a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. DstImageBufOrWaveletResultImId Specifies the identifier of the destination in which to write the result of the wavelet transformation. The identifier must be for an image buffer or a wavelet image processing result buffer. The image buffer can be of any type. The wavelet result buffer must have been allocated on the required system using MimAllocResult() with M_WAVELET_TRANSFORM_RESULT. If the destination is an image buffer, the source must be a wavelet result buffer. If the destination is a wavelet result buffer, the source can be an image or a wavelet result buffer. If you specify an image buffer, there must not be a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. TransformType Specifies the type of wavelet transformation to perform. Set this parameter to one of the following: For specifying the wavelet transformation type Value Description M_FORWARD Specifies a forward wavelet transformation. This decomposes the source according to the number of levels established. The source can be an image or result. The destination must be a result. M_REVERSE Specifies a reverse wavelet transformation. This recomposes the source according to the number of levels established. The source must be a result. The destination can be an image or a result. Level Specifies the number of transformation levels with which to calculate results. Results are written in the specified destination buffer. The level applies to either an M_FORWARD or M_REVERSE transformation. Set this parameter to one of the following: For specifying the transformation level Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies a level of 0. Only supported when using M_REVERSE and the destination is an image. In any other case, M_DEFAULT (or 0) causes an error. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the transformation level. Values depend on the transformation, the source, and the destination. With M_FORWARD, the source can be an image or result; the destination must be a result. In all cases, the level must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the maximum level. If the source is a result, the level must also be greater than the level in the source. If the specified level exceeds the maximum level, MIL uses the maximum level instead. MIL establishes the maximum level to be the point at which transformations at subsequent levels do not provide relevant data. This depends on the source and the wavelet image processing context. With M_REVERSE, the source must be a result; the destination can be a result or an image. If the destination is a result, the level must be greater than 0 and less than the level in the source. If the specified level exceeds the level in the source (maximum level), MIL uses the level in the source instead. If the destination is an image, the level must be 0 (or M_DEFAULT). Setting the level to 0 (or M_DEFAULT) when the destination is a result causes an error. To determine the level in the source result, use it with MimGetResult() and M_NUMBER_OF_LEVELS. To determine the level in the destination result, use it with M_NUMBER_OF_LEVELS. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. Compilation information Header Include mil.h.

Syntax void MimZoneOfInfluence( MIL_ID&nbsp;SrcImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;OperationFlag //in ) Description This function separates an image into zones, according to how much of a blob's surrounding background is within the blob's territorial boundaries, or \"zone of influence\". The image is considered to be binary, with background pixels equal to 0 (black), and all non-zero pixels treated as blobs. It gives every pixel in a blob's zone of influence the same value. Each zone of influence is numbered consecutively, beginning with 1. A blob's zone of influence consists of all pixels closer to that blob than to any other blob. There are as many zones as blobs. Parameters Parameters SrcImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the source of the operation. This parameter must be given an image buffer identifier. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. DstImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination of the resulting image. This parameter must be given an image buffer identifier. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. The destination buffer should be deep enough to hold the maximum number of zones (blobs). The maximum label value is 2 n - 5, where n is the depth of the destination buffer in bits. For example, an 8-bit buffer can be used for a maximum of 251 blobs and a 16-bit buffer can be used for a maximum of 65531 blobs. Note that if the destination buffer depth is too small, several zones might be given the same value. OperationFlag Specifies the type of 3x3 distance matrix used for the operation. The following table shows each value's respective 3x3 distance matrix for calculating the distance to a neighboring pixel, which is then used for the zone of influence computation. This parameter must be set to one of the values below. For controlling the type of 3x3 distance matrix Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_CHESSBOARD. M_CHAMFER_3_4 Uses a distance algorithm that makes a better approximation to actual Euclidean distance, and is therefore more accurate than M_CHESSBOARD. This is the 3x3 distance matrix: M_CHESSBOARD Specifies a chessboard matrix. This operation is faster than M_CHAMFER_3_4. This is the 3x3 distance matrix: Remark In-place processing is supported, but the source and destination image buffers cannot partially overlap (a situation that can only occur when using child buffers).

Features and tolerances are first added to a virtual template. Added features can be physically measured from an image or geometrically constructed from other features. Once features and tolerances have been added to the template, the template itself can be positioned at a new location, depending on where features have been found in the target image. Positioning in metrology can even be done automatically using the results of other MIL modules, such as Model Finder. Measurements are made and results are returned with a high degree of subpixel accuracy.

      "text": " MmetAddFeature Synopsis Add a feature to, or modify a feature of, the metrology template of a metrology context. Syntax void MmetAddFeature( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;FeatureType, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Geometry, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;FeatureLabel, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;BuildOperation, //in const MIL_INT&nbsp;*FeatureLabelArrayPtr, //in const MIL_INT&nbsp;*SubFeatureIndexArrayPtr, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;SizeOfArray, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function adds a feature to the metrology template of the specified metrology context. This function can also modify an existing feature of a metrology template. To delete features, use MmetControl() with M_DELETE. To add several features to the template, you must call this function for each feature to add. Features can either be physically measured from the target image or constructed from a set of other features, which can be referred to as base features. When a feature is composed of several instances of the same feature type, it is considered a multiple feature. Every instance of the feature type is a subfeature of the multiple feature. A single feature is a feature that has only one instance of the feature type. All supported features are single features, except for the edgel feature (M_MEASURED or M_CONSTRUCTED with M_EDGEL) and the measured multiple point feature (M_MEASURED with M_POINT). When adding a constructed feature that requires a point, it is possible to isolate and use a specific point subfeature of a measured multiple point feature. This is not true for the edgel feature since it is always used as a group. Every feature has a position in the metrology template. For a physically measured feature, its position can be considered to be set according to the metrology region in which it is expected to be established (MmetSetRegion()). By default, the metrology region is infinite (the whole target image). For a constructed feature, its position in the template is defined by the position of the features used to construct it (its base features). The position of a feature is relative to a reference coordinate system, referred to as the reference frame. The global frame is the default. If the target image is not calibrated, the global frame's default origin (0,0) is aligned with the center of the top-left corner pixel of the target image. If the target image is calibrated, the global frame's default origin is aligned with the origin of the relative (world) coordinate system. To change the reference frame to a local frame, use MmetControl() with M_REFERENCE_FRAME. Local frames are coordinate systems located anywhere within the metrology template and defined as metrology features. Once a feature is added to the template, it is possible to change its position using MmetSetPosition(). In addition, you can modify the feature so that it is constructed from a new set of base features and/or a new build operation; to do so, call MmetAddFeature() with M_MODIFY. Note that you cannot modify a feature's geometry. To define the acceptable geometric relationship between several features in the template or the acceptable deviation from the definition of a feature, add a geometric tolerance, using MmetAddTolerance(). To calculate the added features and validate the geometric tolerances in the target image, use MmetCalculate(). To change the settings of a feature in the template, use MmetControl(). When adding a constructed feature with a fit operation, or when adding a constructed edgel feature with the clone operation, you can specify base features that have a delimited metrology region (MmetSetRegion()). By default, MIL uses an infinite metrology region (M_INFINITE). Parameters Parameters ContextId Specifies the identifier of the metrology context containing the template. The metrology context must have been previously allocated on the required system using MmetAlloc(). FeatureType Specifies the type of feature to add (M_CONSTRUCTED or M_MEASURED) or specifies to modify a feature (M_MODIFY). See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Geometry Specifies the geometric shape of the feature to add. If modifying a feature (M_MODIFY), this parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. FeatureLabel Specifies the label of the feature. For specifying label values Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that MIL automatically selects the feature's label value. Once a feature is added, you can inquire its label using MmetInquire() with the feature's index and M_LABEL_VALUE. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the label value. Each feature must have a unique label otherwise you will get an error. You can have an extremely high number of labels (up to M_MET_FEATURE_ID_MAX). BuildOperation Specifies the operation to use to build the feature. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. FeatureLabelArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(SizeOfArray) Specifies the array that holds the label of every feature to use to construct the feature. Features used to construct a feature are considered to be its base features. Set this parameter to M_NULL when adding measured features or parametrically constructed features (M_PARAMETRIC). SubFeatureIndexArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(SizeOfArray) Specifies the array that holds the index of every subfeature to use to construct the feature. Features used to construct a feature are considered to be its base features. If all features referenced by FeatureLabelArrayPtr are single features, set SubFeatureIndexArrayPtr to M_NULL. This is also true when adding measured features or parametrically constructed features (M_PARAMETRIC). If some features referenced by FeatureLabelArrayPtr are multiple features, set SubFeatureIndexArrayPtr to an array that is the same size as the FeatureLabelArrayPtr array. Set each element of the SubFeatureIndexArrayPtr array to the index of the subfeature to use for the feature at the corresponding element of the FeatureLabelArrayPtr array; for single features, set their corresponding element in the SubFeatureIndexArrayPtr array to 0. SizeOfArray Specifies the size of the arrays that hold the information that will be used to construct the feature (FeatureLabelArrayPtr and SubFeatureIndexArrayPtr). When setting the FeatureLabelArrayPtr parameter to M_NULL, set this parameter to 0. When using a standard vector (std::vector) overload function in C++, you can pass M_DEFAULT to this parameter and MIL will automatically determine the size based on the number of items in the vector passed to the FeatureLabelArrayPtr or SubFeatureIndexArrayPtr parameter. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. Parameter associations The tables below list possible values for the FeatureType, Geometry, and BuildOperation parameters. For adding a constructed feature For adding a measured feature For modifying a feature To add a constructed feature, the FeatureType, Geometry, and BuildOperation parameters can be set to the following values. Note that certain build operations for constructed features require base features, which you can specify using the FeatureLabelArrayPtr parameter and, if necessary, the SubFeatureIndexArrayPtr parameter. For adding a constructed feature FeatureType Description Geometry BuildOperation M_CONSTRUCTED Adds a constructed feature. Constructed features are geometrically built using base features (other features added using MmetAddFeature()), or they are defined by their parametric controls (set using MmetControl()). In the latter case, they are referred to as parametrically constructed features (M_PARAMETRIC). Constructed features built using an M_CLONE_FEATURE operation are cloned from the specified base feature (FeatureLabelArrayPtr). For example, an arc can be cloned from an arc feature. Cloned features can be scaled, rotated, and/or moved using MmetControl() with M_CLONE_.... The base features of constructed features built using a fit operation (M_FIT, M_INNER_FIT, or M_OUTER_FIT) can be delimited by a metrology region. You must call MmetSetRegion() to specify the metrology region for each base feature. The base feature of a constructed edgel feature built using M_CLONE_FEATURE can also be delimited by a metrology region. MIL only uses the edgels or points within the delimited region of the base feature to build the constructed feature; edgels or points outside the region are clipped. For constructed features that require several points or edgels, the actual number of point and edgel features can vary. For example, if 3 points are needed to construct a feature, it is possible to provide one multiple point feature containing three points, three separate point features, or one multiple point feature containing two points and one point subfeature. Only the total number of elements is important, not the number of features. If you do not specify the subfeature indices, then all subfeatures are used. Constructed features built with M_FIT depend on M_FIT_TYPE and the settings related to the type of fit selected. All fit operations will fail if their coverage is less than M_FIT_COVERAGE_MIN. If the constructed feature uses edgels as a source, then the fit operations are also affected by the gradient angle settings. You can adjust these using MmetControl() with M_EDGEL_ANGLE_RANGE and M_EDGEL_RELATIVE_ANGLE. When performing a standard best fit (M_STANDARD_FIT), more importance is typically given to the edgels whose gradient orientation follows the region's orientation. M_ARC Adds a constructed arc feature. M_DEFAULT Same as M_PARAMETRIC. M_CLONE_FEATURE Specifies that the arc feature is cloned from the specified base feature. M_CONSTRUCTION Specifies that the arc feature is built from a geometric construction using the specified base features. You can specify any three of the following as base features: points, circles, arcs, or local frames. For example, you can specify three point features, or one point, one circle, and one local frame feature. In all cases, MIL requires three points to construct the arc. If you specify a circle or arc feature, MIL takes its center point. If you specify a local frame feature, MIL takes its origin point. To build the arc, MIL uses the first, second, and third point as the center, the start, and the end of the arc, respectively. If the radius formed by the first and second points is not equal to the radius formed by the first and third points, the constructed arc will pass as close as possible to both the second and third points. This occurs because arc features are circular arcs, which are portions of a circle. Therefore, every point on the arc must have the same radius. Note that arcs follow the counter-clockwise convention. M_FIT Specifies that the arc feature is built from the arc that best fits the specified base features. You can specify three or more edgels or points as base features. It is possible to have a combination of edgels and points. The best fit arc passes as close to as much data as possible while not necessarily touching it. Note that arcs follow the counter-clockwise convention. The angular constraints are ignored for the base features which do not have angle information. M_PARAMETRIC Specifies that the arc feature is built from the following MmetControl() parametric controls: M_POSITION_X, M_POSITION_Y, M_ANGLE_START, M_ANGLE_END, and M_RADIUS. M_CIRCLE Adds a constructed circle feature. M_DEFAULT Same as M_PARAMETRIC. M_CLONE_FEATURE Specifies that the circle feature is cloned from the specified base feature. M_CONSTRUCTION Specifies that the circle feature is built from a geometric construction using the specified base features. You can specify any two of the following as base features: points, circles, arcs, or local frames. For example, you can specify two point features, or one point and one circle. In all cases, MIL requires two points to construct the circle. If you specify a circle or arc feature, MIL takes its center point. If you specify a local frame feature, MIL takes its origin point. To build the circle, MIL uses the first point as the center of the circle, while the second point is considered to be on the circle's contour. The distance between the two points is the new circle's radius. M_FIT Specifies that the circle feature is built from the circle that best fits the specified base features. You can specify three or more edgels or points as base features. It is possible to have a combination of edgels and points. The best fit circle passes as close to as much data as possible while not necessarily touching it. The angular constraints are ignored for the base features which do not have angle information. M_INNER_FIT Specifies that the circle feature is built from the best inner fit of a circle around the specified base features. You can specify three or more edgels or points as base features. It is possible to have a combination of edgels and points. The inner fit for a circle feature is the largest possible circle that does not contain any edgels or points. The circle feature is fit to the edgels or points using M_STANDARD_FIT mode. Therefore, all settings related to M_STANDARD_FIT will affect the M_INNER_FIT circle. The angular constraints are ignored for the base features which do not have angle information. M_OUTER_FIT Specifies that the circle feature is built from the best outer fit of a circle around the specified base features. You can specify three or more edgels or points as base features. It is possible to have a combination of edgels and points. The outer fit for a circle feature is the smallest possible circle that contains all the edgels or points. The circle feature is fit to the edgels or points using M_STANDARD_FIT mode. Therefore, all settings related to M_STANDARD_FIT will affect the M_OUTER_FIT circle. The angular constraints are ignored for the base features which do not have angle information. M_PARAMETRIC Specifies that the circle feature is built from the following MmetControl() parametric controls: M_POSITION_X, M_POSITION_Y, and M_RADIUS. M_EDGEL Adds a constructed edgel feature. M_DEFAULT Same as M_COPY_FEATURE_EDGELS. M_CLONE_FEATURE Specifies that the edgel feature is cloned from the specified base feature. M_COPY_FEATURE_EDGELS Specifies that the edgel feature is constructed by copying the edgels of the specified base features. You can specify physically measured features or constructed edgel features as base features. For physically measured base features, you can restrict the operation to copy only the active edgels or only the fitted edgels of the base features, using MmetControl() with M_EDGEL_TYPE. For constructed edgel base features, MIL considers the edgels active (not fitted). M_EXTERNAL_FEATURE Specifies that the edgel feature is constructed from edgels or points established using other MIL modules or third party software. Use MmetPut() to add the edgels/points to the feature. M_GROUP_EDGELS Specifies that the edgel feature is constructed by grouping the edgels of the specified base features. By default, MIL uses all edgels. To change this (for example, to group edgels according to the distance to a point), call MmetControl() with M_GROUP_SELECTION_MODE. M_LINE Adds a constructed line feature. M_DEFAULT Same as M_PARAMETRIC. M_ANGLE Specifies that the line feature is built at a specified angle from the specified linear base feature (segment or line), and passing through the specified point base feature. You can specify one or two base features. If one base feature is specified, it must be a point. In this case, the reference line from which the angle is measured is the X-axis of the reference frame. If two base features are specified, one must be a point and the other must be a line or a segment. The order in which you specify the base features does not matter. To specify the angle, use MmetControl() with M_ANGLE and set a value between 0° and 360°. The angle is measured counter-clockwise, relative to the linear feature (from start to end). M_BISECTOR Specifies that the line feature is built by dividing an angle formed by the specified base features. You can specify three points or two lines as base features. By default, MIL builds the feature by dividing the angle, formed by the base features, in two equal parts. If three points are specified, the first point is used as the vertex of the angle. If two lines are specified, the bisector line is built where it divides the angle formed by the first line and the second line in the counter-clockwise direction. If specifying two lines as base features, you can use MmetControl() with M_LINE_BISECTOR_TYPE to alter how the new line is built. For example, you can build the bisector line at the middle of the smallest or biggest angle formed by the two line base features. M_CLONE_FEATURE Specifies that the line feature is cloned from the specified base feature. M_CONSTRUCTION Specifies that the line feature is built from a geometric construction using the specified base features. You can specify any two of the following as base features: points, circles, arcs, or local frames. For example, you can specify two point features, or one point and one circle. In all cases, MIL requires two points to construct the line. If you specify a circle or arc feature, MIL takes its center point. If you specify a local frame feature, MIL takes its origin point. To build the line, MIL ensures that it passes through the two points specified. M_FIT Specifies that the line feature is built from the resulting best fit of the specified base feature. You can specify a segment as the base feature. M_PARALLEL Specifies that the line feature is built parallel to the specified linear base feature (segment or line), and passing through the specified point base feature. You can specify one or two base features. If one base feature is specified, it must be a point. In this case, the line feature is built parallel to the X-axis of the reference frame. If two base features are specified, one must be a point and the other must be a line or a segment. The order in which you specify the base features does not matter. M_PARAMETRIC Specifies that the line feature is built from the following MmetControl() parametric controls: M_LINE_A, M_LINE_B, and M_LINE_C. M_PERPENDICULAR Specifies that the line feature is built perpendicular to the specified linear base feature (segment or line), and passing through the specified point base feature. You can specify one or two base features. If one base feature is specified, it must be a point. In this case, the line feature is built perpendicular to the X-axis of the reference frame. If two base features are specified, one must be a point and the other must be a line or a segment. The order in which you specify the base features does not matter. M_SECTOR_RELATIVE Specifies that the line feature is built where it divides, in two parts, an angle formed by the specified base features. You can specify three points as base features. The first point is used as the vertex of the angle. Specify the size of the angle between the line and the first pair of points (first and second points) using MmetControl() with M_ANGLE. Express the angle as a percentage of the total angle of all three points. M_LOCAL_FRAME Adds a constructed local frame feature. M_DEFAULT Same as M_PARAMETRIC. M_CLONE_FEATURE Specifies that the local frame feature is cloned from the specified base feature. M_CONSTRUCTION Specifies that the local frame feature is built from a geometric construction using one or two specified base features. You can specify one or two of the following as base features: points, circles, arcs, or local frames. You also specify a segment if it is the only base feature. When you specify two base features, the local frame's origin is set at the center of the first base feature, and the local frame's X-axis is set to pass through and in the direction of the center of the second base feature. If you specify a local frame as a base feature, MIL uses its origin to construct the local frame. You can also build a local frame by specifying only one base feature. MIL uses the center of the specified feature as the origin of the local frame. MIL sets the local frame's X-axis at a specified angle from the X-axis of the reference frame; use MmetControl() with M_ANGLE to specify the local frame's angle. The angle is applied in the counter-clockwise direction. When the base feature is a segment, the origin of the local frame is set at the segment's center; the local frame's X-axis is aligned with the segment, pointing in the direction from the segment's first point to its second point. M_PARAMETRIC Specifies that the local frame feature is built from the following MmetControl() parametric controls: M_POSITION_X, M_POSITION_Y, and M_ANGLE. Note that the angle is measured counter-clockwise, and is relative to the global frame. M_POINT Adds a constructed point feature. M_DEFAULT Same as M_PARAMETRIC. M_ANGLE_ABSOLUTE Specifies that the point feature is built at the specified absolute angle, on the contour of the specified base feature. You can specify either an arc or a circle as the base feature. The angle, in degrees, is relative to the start of the contour of the specified feature and is set using MmetControl() with M_ANGLE. The angle is measured counter-clockwise. Note that the start of a circle's contour is at its rightmost side, or 0°. This is the point where the circle's positive X-axis meets the circle, given a local origin at the circle's center. M_ANGLE_RELATIVE Specifies that the point feature is built at the specified relative angle, on the contour of the specified base feature. You can specify either an arc or a circle as the base feature. Specify the angle as a percentage, relative to the start of the contour using MmetControl() with M_ANGLE. Note that the start of a circle's contour is at its rightmost side, or 0°. This is the point where the circle's positive X-axis meets the circle, given a local origin at the circle's center. M_CENTER Specifies that the point feature is built at the center of the specified base feature(s). You can specify one, or a combination, of the following as base features: arc, circle, edgel, local frame, point, or segment. If multiple features are provided, the point feature is built at the center of gravity of the centers of all the features. M_CENTER does not necessarily build a point on the feature's edge. Use M_MIDDLE if you want to build a point at the edge's midpoint. M_CLONE_FEATURE Specifies that the point feature is cloned from the specified base feature. M_CLOSEST Specifies that the point feature is built at the point on the first specified base feature that is, by default, closest to the other (one or more) specified base features. You can specify any features as the base features. You can explicitly specify an angle at which to build the closest point between the features, by calling MmetControl() with M_DISTANCE_MODE. This can be seen as a type of caliper feature. MIL considers the specified distance mode angle at which to measure the closest distance to be relative to the first base feature. MIL applies the angle counter-clockwise. M_CLOSEST_TO_INFINITE_POINT Specifies that the point feature is built, at the position on the base feature, that is the closest to an infinite point. This is a virtual point that MIL establishes, at infinity, along the direction (X-axis) of the local frame. To change the angle along which to establish the infinite point, call MmetControl() with M_ANGLE. MIL measures this angle counter-clockwise, relative to the X-axis of the local frame. The base features can be any feature except line, which is itself infinite (unbounded). You can, for example, use M_CLOSEST_TO_INFINITE_POINT to establish the boundaries of an edgel feature by fetching the coordinates of the constructed closest infinite points at 0°, 90, 180°, and 270° angles. M_EXTENDED_INTERSECTION Specifies that the point feature is built at the point of intersection between the extension of the first and second specified base features. Note that the following can be extended: a segment, which is extended into a line, and an arc, which is extended into a circle. You can specify the following as base features: A segment feature and a segment, arc, circle, line, segment, or edgel feature. An arc feature and a segment, arc, circle, line, or edgel feature. A circle feature and a segment or arc feature. A line feature and a segment or arc feature. An edgel feature and a segment or arc feature. If there is more than one intersection candidate, specify the index of the intersection at which to build the feature, using MmetControl() with M_OCCURRENCE; the intersection is relative to the first feature that has a direction. The default intersection is the one indexed as 0. M_INTERSECTION Specifies that the point feature is built at the point of intersection between the first and second specified base features. You can specify the following as base features: A segment feature and a segment, arc, circle, line, or edgel feature. An arc feature and a segment, arc, circle, line, or edgel feature. A circle feature and a segment, arc, circle, or edgel feature. A line feature and a segment, arc, line, or edgel feature. An edgel feature and a segment, arc, circle, line, or edgel feature. If there is more than one intersection candidate, specify the index of the intersection at which to build the feature, using MmetControl() with M_OCCURRENCE; the intersection is relative to the first feature that has a direction. The default intersection is the one indexed as 0. For two circle intersections, specify the intersections relative to the segment that can be created by joining the circles' centers. The first intersection obtained by scanning the first circle counter-clockwise from the segment is indexed as 0; the other is indexed at 1. M_MAX_DISTANCE_POINT Specifies that the point feature is built at the point on the first specified base feature that is, by default, farthest from any one point on the other (one or more) specified base features. You can specify any feature except line as the first base feature, and any feature as the other base features. M_MAX_OF_MIN_DISTANCE_POINT Specifies that the point feature is built at the point on the first specified base feature that is the farthest of all the closest points on the second base feature. This point can be considered the maximin (the greatest of all the smallest). You can specify any feature except a line as the first base feature, and any feature except an edgel as the second base feature. M_MIDDLE Specifies that the point feature is built at the midpoint of the contour (edge) of the specified base feature. You can specify a segment, arc, circle, or edgel as the base feature. The middle of the contour of a circle is where the circle intersects the negative X-axis at 180°. When using an edgel as the base feature, the point feature is built at the position of the edgel occupying the center position in the group (rounded down). For example, for an edgel feature containing 5 edgels, [Edgel0, Edgel1, Edgel2, Edgel3, Edgel4], the point is built at Edgel2's position. M_MIDDLE builds a point, located on the feature's edge, that splits the edge at the halfway mark. Use M_CENTER if you want to build the point feature at the center point of the specified features and not necessarily on the feature's edge. M_PARAMETRIC Specifies that the point feature is built from the following MmetControl() parametric controls: M_POSITION_X and M_POSITION_Y. M_POSITION_ABSOLUTE Specifies that the point feature is built at the specified position on the contour of the specified base feature. You can specify a segment, arc, circle, or edgel feature as the base feature. The position is relative to the start of the contour of the specified feature and is set using MmetControl() with M_POSITION. In the example below, M_POSITION has a value of 40 and the provided segment feature has a length of 120. Note that the start of a circle's contour is at its rightmost side, or 0°. This is the point where the circle's positive X-axis meets the circle, given a local origin at the circle's center. The start of the contour of an edgel feature is the first edgel subfeature of the edgel feature. M_POSITION_END Specifies that the point feature is built at the end of the contour of the specified base feature. You can specify a segment, arc, circle, or edgel feature as the base feature. Note that the end of a circle's contour is at its rightmost side, or 360°. This is the point where the circle's positive X-axis meets the circle, given a local origin at the circle's center, and is the same point as its start of contour. The end of the contour of an edgel feature is the last edgel subfeature of the edgel feature. M_POSITION_RELATIVE Specifies that the point feature is built at the specified relative position on the contour of the specified base feature. You can specify a segment, arc, circle, or edgel feature as the base feature. Specify the position as a percentage of the total length of the specified feature's contour, relative to the start of the contour, using MmetControl() with M_POSITION. In the example below, M_POSITION is set to 50%. Note that the start of a circle's contour is at its rightmost side, or 0°. This is the point where the circle's positive X-axis meets the circle, given a local origin at the circle's center. The start of the contour of an edgel feature is the first edgel subfeature of the edgel feature. M_POSITION_START Specifies that the point feature is built at the start position of the contour of the specified base feature. You can specify a segment, arc, circle, or edgel feature as the base feature. Note that the start of a circle's contour is at its rightmost side, or 0°. This is the point where the circle's positive X-axis meets the circle, given a local origin at the circle's center. The start of the contour of an edgel feature is the first edgel subfeature of the edgel feature. M_SEGMENT Adds a constructed segment feature. M_DEFAULT Same as M_PARAMETRIC. M_CLONE_FEATURE Specifies that the segment feature is cloned from the specified base feature. M_CONSTRUCTION Specifies that the segment feature is built from a geometric construction using the specified base features. You can specify any two of the following as base features: points, circles, arcs, or local frames. For example, you can specify two point features, or one point and one circle. In all cases, MIL requires two points to construct the segment. If you specify a circle or arc feature, MIL takes its center point. If you specify a local frame feature, MIL takes its origin point. To build the segment, MIL uses the first point as the start of the segment and the second as the end of the segment. M_FIT Specifies that the segment feature is built from the line that best fits the specified base features. You can specify two or more edgels or points as base features. The best fit segment passes as close to as much data as possible while not necessarily touching it. The start of the segment is the extremity closest to the origin of the reference frame. The angular constraints are ignored for the base features which do not have angle information. M_INNER_FIT Specifies that the segment feature is built from the segment that has the best inner fit in the specified base features. You can specify two or more edgels or points as base features. The edgels used to find the inner fit segment are the active edgels on the counter-clockwise side of the best fit segment (from start to end). These edgels are considered active edgels since they satisfy the edgel constraints set using MmetControl(). The best fit segment, whose starting point is the extremity closest to the origin of the global frame, separates the inner and outer fit regions. The inner fit segment passes through the two farthest edgels of the inner fit region such that all the edgels of the inner fit region are located on the same side of the inner fit segment. All the active edgels can be projected on the segment, so the segment's extremities are determined by the two farthest active edgels. The angular constraints are ignored for the base features which do not have angle information. M_OUTER_FIT Specifies that the segment feature is built from the outer fit of the specified base features. You can specify two or more edgels or points as base features. The edgels used to find the outer fit segment are the active edgels on the clockwise side of the best fit segment, relative to its direction. These edgels are considered active edgels since they satisfy the edgel constraints set using MmetControl(). The best fit segment, whose starting point is the extremity closest to the origin of the global frame, separates the inner and outer fit regions. The outer fit segment passes through the two farthest edgels of the outer fit region such that all the edgels of the outer fit region are located on the same side of the outer fit segment. All the active edgels can be projected on the segment, so the segment's extremities are determined by the two farthest active edgels. The angular constraints are ignored for the base features which do not have angle information. M_PARAMETRIC Specifies that the segment feature is built from the following MmetControl() parametric controls: M_POSITION_START_X, M_POSITION_START_Y, M_POSITION_END_X, and M_POSITION_END_Y. To add a measured feature, the FeatureType, Geometry, and BuildOperation parameters can be set to the following values. For adding a measured feature FeatureType Description Geometry BuildOperation M_MEASURED Adds a physically measured feature. Measured features are built using data (contour edgels) extracted from the target image within the metrology region. Measured features built with M_FIT depend on M_FIT_TYPE and the settings related to the type of fit selected. All fit operations will fail if their coverage is less than M_FIT_COVERAGE_MIN. Fit operations for measured features are also affected by the gradient angle settings, which you can control using M_EDGEL_ANGLE_RANGE and M_EDGEL_RELATIVE_ANGLE. When performing a standard best fit (M_STANDARD_FIT), more importance is typically given to the edgels whose gradient orientation follows the region's orientation. M_ARC Adds a physically measured arc feature. In this case, you must use an infinite or a ring-sector metrology region (MmetSetRegion()). M_DEFAULT Same as M_FIT. M_FIT Specifies that the measured arc feature is built using a best fit operation applied to the data (edgels) extracted from the metrology region. The best fit arc passes as close to as much data as possible while not necessarily touching it. M_CIRCLE Adds a physically measured circle feature. In this case, you must use an infinite or a ring metrology region (MmetSetRegion()). M_DEFAULT Same as M_FIT. M_FIT Specifies that the measured circle feature is built using a best fit operation applied to the data (edgels) extracted from the metrology region. The best fit circle passes as close to as much data as possible while not necessarily touching it. M_INNER_FIT Specifies that the measured circle feature is built using the best inner fit operation applied to the data (edgels) extracted from the metrology region. The inner fit for a circle feature is the largest possible circle that does not contain any edgels. The circle feature is fit to the edgels using M_STANDARD_FIT mode. Therefore, all settings related to M_STANDARD_FIT will affect the M_INNER_FIT circle. M_OUTER_FIT Specifies that the measured circle feature is built using the best outer fit operation applied to the data (edgels) extracted from the metrology region. The outer fit for a circle feature is the smallest possible circle that contains all the edgels. The circle feature is fit to the edgels using M_STANDARD_FIT mode. Therefore, all settings related to M_STANDARD_FIT will affect the M_OUTER_FIT circle. M_EDGEL Adds a physically measured edgel feature. In this case, you must use an infinite, rectangle, ring, or ring-sector metrology region (MmetSetRegion()). M_DEFAULT Specifies that the measured edgel feature is built by extracting all the edgels in the metrology region. M_POINT Adds a physically measured point feature. In this case, you must use an arc, infinite, or segment metrology region (MmetSetRegion()). M_DEFAULT Same as M_FIT. M_FIT Specifies that the measured point feature is built using a best fit operation applied to the data (edgels) extracted from the metrology region. M_SEGMENT Adds a physically measured segment feature. In this case, you must use an infinite, rectangle, or ring-sector metrology region (MmetSetRegion()). M_DEFAULT Same as M_FIT. M_FIT Specifies that the measured segment feature is built from the line that best fits the data (edgels) extracted from the metrology region. The best fit segment passes as close to as much data as possible while not necessarily touching it. The start of the segment is the extremity closest to the origin of the global frame. M_INNER_FIT Specifies that the measured segment feature is built from the segment that has the best inner fit applied to the data (edgels) extracted from the metrology region. For more information on how an inner fit segment differs from a best fit segment, see M_CONSTRUCTED with M_SEGMENT and M_INNER_FIT. M_OUTER_FIT Specifies that the measured segment feature is built from the segment that has the best outer fit applied to the data (edgels) extracted from the metrology region. For more information on how an outer fit segment differs from a best fit segment, see M_CONSTRUCTED with M_SEGMENT and M_OUTER_FIT. To modify a feature, the FeatureType, Geometry, and BuildOperation parameters can be set to the following values. For modifying a feature FeatureType Description Geometry BuildOperation M_MODIFY Modifies the build operation of the specified feature, and/or for a constructed feature, modifies its base features, which is the set of features used to build the constructed feature. To specify the new features from which to construct the specified feature, use FeatureLabelArrayPtr and SubFeatureIndexArrayPtr. M_DEFAULT Specifies to use the current geometry of the feature. The selected feature's geometry cannot be changed. M_DEFAULT Specifies to change only the features from which the selected feature is built (its base features) and that the selected feature's build operation should not be changed. BuildOperation Specifies a new build operation for the selected feature. The new build operation must be appropriate for the feature's geometry. See the For adding a constructed feature or For adding a measured feature table for possible build operations given the feature's geometry. When modifying a constructed feature, you must pass the list of base features from which to construct the specified feature (FeatureLabelArrayPtr and SubFeatureIndexArrayPtr), even if you only need to modify the build operation.

Syntax void MmetAddTolerance( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ToleranceType, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;ToleranceLabel, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;ValueMin, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;ValueMax, //in const MIL_INT&nbsp;*FeatureLabelArrayPtr, //in const MIL_INT&nbsp;*SubFeatureIndexArrayPtr, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;SizeOfArray, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function adds a geometric tolerance to the metrology template of the specified metrology context. This function can also modify an existing tolerance of a metrology template. To delete geometric tolerances, use MmetControl() with M_DELETE. To add several geometric tolerances, you must call this function for each tolerance to add. A geometric tolerance defines the acceptable deviation from the definition of a feature, or the acceptable relationship between multiple features. For example, you can add a geometric tolerance to the metrology template to specify that one feature must be a certain length, or that two features must be perpendicular. To add a feature, use MmetAddFeature(). When adding a geometric tolerance that requires a point, you can use a specific point subfeature of a measured multiple point feature by specifying its index with the SubFeatureIndexArrayPtr parameter. Note that you cannot do this for other features, including the measured multiple edgel feature, as it is always used as a group. When adding a geometric tolerance, you must also set its minimum and maximum limit values with the ValueMin and ValueMax parameters. When defining the tolerance of one feature, these limits represent the acceptable deviation from the definition of the feature. For example, a segment's length tolerance can be between 90 and 100 pixels. For multiple features, these limits represent the valid range of acceptable values between the features. For example, the perpendicular tolerance between two segments can be +/- 0.05° (that is, 89.95° to 90.05°). You can also set warning values to alert you when the tolerance is close to its minimum and maximum limits, using MmetControl() with M_VALUE_WARNING_MIN and M_VALUE_WARNING_MAX. When you call MmetCalculate(), the tolerance is calculated (for example, 95 pixels) and a status is assigned (for example, M_PASS). To retrieve the tolerance value or the status, use MmetGetResult() with M_TOLERANCE_VALUE or M_STATUS, respectively. You can modify a geometric tolerance (using M_MODIFY) so that it uses a new set of features or subfeatures. In this case, you can also modify the minimum and maximum limit values of a tolerance. If a camera calibration context is associated with the target image, set values in real-world units (for example, tolerance values and warning values, and positional values). Otherwise use pixel units. For more information, see the Camera calibration - overview section of Chapter 28: Calibrating your camera setup. Parameters Parameters ContextId Specifies the identifier of the metrology context. The metrology context must have been previously allocated on the required system using MmetAlloc(). ToleranceType Specifies the type of geometric tolerance to add. The icon (image symbol) of every tolerance type is in its description. You can draw this icon using MmetDraw() with M_DRAW_TOLERANCE. For adding geometric tolerances Value Description M_ANGULARITY Adds an angularity tolerance. The icon for this tolerance is: An angularity tolerance validates that the angle between two features falls within the specified angular range (for example, that two lines intersect at an angle between 25° and 35°). An angularity tolerance can be applied between the following features. Two segment features. To validate the angularity between two segment features, MIL internally connects each segment at their start point and considers the angle between them to be, counter-clockwise, from the first segment to the second segment. This angle is valid if it falls within the angular range set by the minimum and maximum tolerance limits. To designate the valid angular range, the minimum and maximum tolerance limits are angles applied counter-clockwise around the start point of the first segment. Note that MIL does not physically rearrange the specified segments, it only orients them internally to measure the required angles. Each segment's start point, as well as the order you list the segments in the FeatureLabelArrayPtr parameter, can affect your results. For example, the angle between segment 1 and segment 2 is different than the angle between segment 2 and segment 1. Two line features. To validate the angularity between two line features, MIL considers the angle between them to be, counter-clockwise, from the first line to the second line. This angle is valid if it falls within the angular range set by the minimum and maximum tolerance limits. To designate the valid angular range, the minimum and maximum tolerance limits are angles applied counter-clockwise, from the first line to the second line, around the intersection point of the two lines. The order you list the lines in the FeatureLabelArrayPtr parameter can affect your results. For example, the angle between line 1 and line 2 is different than the angle between line 2 and line 1. Since lines are infinite, there are actually two ways to measure the angle between line 1 and line 2 (indicated as angle (a) in the following diagram) and between line 2 and line 1 (indicated as angle (b) in the following diagram). Note that this is inconsequential since each pair of angles is equivalent. A linear feature (segment or line) and an edgel feature. For one linear feature (segment or line) and one edgel feature, M_ANGULARITY validates the width of the projection of the edgel feature, along the nominal angle specified using MmetControl() with M_ANGLE. The angle is in the counter-clockwise direction relative to the linear feature. The minimum and maximum tolerance parameters set the valid projection width. Typically, you should set the minimum width value to 0. The width of the projection is in pixel or world units. The second feature specified in the FeatureLabelArrayPtr parameter must be edgel. Three point features. To validate the angularity between three point features, MIL considers the first point as the center of the angularity tolerance, the second point as the StartAngle (in the counter-clockwise direction relative to the first point), and the third point as the EndAngle (in the counter-clockwise direction relative to the first point). M_ANGULARITY validates the angle that results from EndAngle - StartAngle. Note that an angularity tolerance between a segment and a line produces too many ambiguities and therefore cannot be calculated. M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES Adds an area tolerance for the area between two curves of edgels. The icon for this tolerance is: To use M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES, you must specify two edgel features (FeatureLabelArrayPtr). MIL internally joins the edgels of each edgel feature to form two curves, between which the area is validated. When specifying an edgel feature with this tolerance, MIL internally sorts and filters the edgels, and uses a maximum gap between them, to determine whether they are part of the same curve. To specify an explicit gap size, call MmetControl() with M_CURVE_EDGEL_GAP_SIZE. By default, M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES assumes each edgel (curve) feature is unbounded (open), and does not expect the edgels to follow a specific direction. To modify this behavior and potentially speed up calculations and accuracy, call MmetControl() with M_CURVE_INFO. If the two curves cross over each other, there will be areas on both sides of the curves. By default, MIL adds all the areas. To modify this behavior (for example, to calculate the area on only one side of a curve), call MmetControl() with M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES_ONE_SIDE_ONLY or M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES_OPPOSITES_SUBTRACT. If you maintain the default behavior of M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES, the order in which you specify the curves is inconsequential. To draw the actual area that MIL uses to define this tolerance, call MmetDraw() with M_DRAW_TOLERANCE_AREA.... M_AREA_CONVEX_HULL Adds an area tolerance, based on the convex hull, for the surface of an edgel, point, or circle feature. The icon for this tolerance is: M_AREA_CONVEX_HULL validates that the surface area (convex hull) of the specified feature (FeatureLabelArrayPtr) falls within the minimum and maximum limit values. To draw the actual area that MIL uses to define this tolerance, call MmetDraw() with M_DRAW_TOLERANCE_AREA.... M_AREA_SIMPLE Adds a simple area tolerance for the surface of an edgel, point, or circle feature. The icon for this tolerance is: M_AREA_SIMPLE validates that the surface area of the specified feature (FeatureLabelArrayPtr) falls within the minimum and maximum limit values. To draw the actual area that MIL uses to define this tolerance, call MmetDraw() with M_DRAW_TOLERANCE_AREA.... M_AREA_UNDER_CURVE_MAX Adds an area tolerance for the maximum area under a curve of edgels or points. The icon for this tolerance is: M_AREA_UNDER_CURVE_MAX validates the maximum area between a curve (edgel or point) feature and a line feature (FeatureLabelArrayPtr). MIL considers the maximum area to be between an internally established curve under the furthest set of edgels or points and the line. The order of the features specified with the FeatureLabelArrayPtr parameter is inconsequential, since MIL always validates the curve (edgel or point) feature against the line feature. M_AREA_UNDER_CURVE_MAX is typically used to validate the entire area under a curve (edgel or point) feature and a line, regardless of any interfering edges or noise. When specifying an edgel feature with this tolerance, MIL internally sorts and filters the edgels, and uses a maximum gap between them, to determine whether they are part of the same curve. To specify an explicit gap size, call MmetControl() with M_CURVE_EDGEL_GAP_SIZE. When specifying a point feature with this tolerance, MIL does not manipulate the points and chains all of them, assuming the resulting curve is well defined; for example, MIL assumes the chained points do not create a degenerate polygonal figure, where curves cross over each other. If the specified curve (edgel or point) feature that you are validating crosses over the specified line feature, you are considered to have opposing areas (that is, there are areas on both sides of the line), and the tolerance fails, by default. You can allow MIL to consider opposing (negative) areas when establishing the area tolerance, by calling MmetControl() with M_AREA_UNDER_CURVE_ALLOW_NEGATIVE. In general, the curve (edgel or point) feature should remain on one side of the line. To draw the actual area that MIL uses to define this tolerance, call MmetDraw() with M_DRAW_TOLERANCE_AREA.... M_AREA_UNDER_CURVE_MIN Adds an area tolerance for the minimum area under a curve of edgels. The icon for this tolerance is: M_AREA_UNDER_CURVE_MIN validates the minimum area between a curve (edgel or point) feature and a line feature (FeatureLabelArrayPtr). MIL considers the minimum area to be between an internally established curve under the furthest set of edgels or points and the line. The order of the features specified with the FeatureLabelArrayPtr parameter is inconsequential, since MIL always validates the curve (edgel or point) feature against the line feature. M_AREA_UNDER_CURVE_MIN is typically used to validate the exclusive area under a curve (edgel or point) feature and a line, which excludes the area under the curve and any interfering edges or noise. When specifying an edgel feature with this tolerance, MIL performs an internal sort and filtering of the edgels, and uses a maximum gap between edgels to determine whether they are part of the same curve. To specify an explicit gap size, call MmetControl() with M_CURVE_EDGEL_GAP_SIZE. When specifying a point feature with this tolerance, MIL does not manipulate the points and chains all of them, assuming the resulting curve is well defined; for example, MIL assumes the chained points do not create a degenerate polygonal figure, where curves cross over each other. If the specified curve (edgel or point) feature that the tolerance validates crosses over the specified line feature, you are considered to have opposing areas (that is, there are areas on both sides of the line), and the tolerance fails, by default. You can allow MIL to consider opposing (negative) areas when establishing the area tolerance, by calling MmetControl() with M_AREA_UNDER_CURVE_ALLOW_NEGATIVE. In general, the curve (edgel or point) feature should remain on one side of the line. To draw the actual area that MIL uses to define this tolerance, call MmetDraw() with M_DRAW_TOLERANCE_AREA.... M_CONCENTRICITY Adds a concentricity tolerance. The icon for this tolerance is: M_CONCENTRICITY validates the concentricity between a combination of two of the following features: arc or circle. This tolerance validates the distance between the centers of the features. Ideally, concentric features have the same center. The order of the features specified in the FeatureLabelArrayPtr parameter is inconsequential. M_DISTANCE_MAX Adds a maximum distance tolerance. The icon for this tolerance is: M_DISTANCE_MAX validates that a specified maximum distance is separating any two features except lines. By default, MIL uses the distance at which the features are the farthest. In this case, the order of the features in the FeatureLabelArrayPtr parameter is inconsequential. You can explicitly specify an angle at which to apply the maximum distance tolerance between two features, by calling MmetControl() with M_DISTANCE_MODE. This can be seen as a type of caliper tolerance between the features. In this case, the order of the features in the FeatureLabelArrayPtr parameter can affect your results, since MIL considers the specified angle at which to measure the maximum distance to be relative to the first feature. MIL applies the angle counter-clockwise. M_DISTANCE_MIN Adds a minimum distance tolerance. The icon for this tolerance is: M_DISTANCE_MIN validates that a specified minimum distance is separating any two features. By default, MIL uses the distance at which the features are the closest. In this case, the order of the features in the FeatureLabelArrayPtr parameter is inconsequential. You can explicitly specify an angle at which to apply the minimum distance tolerance between two features, by calling MmetControl() with M_DISTANCE_MODE. This can be seen as a type of caliper tolerance between the features. In this case, the order of the features in the FeatureLabelArrayPtr parameter can affect your results, since MIL considers the specified angle at which to measure the minimum distance to be relative to the first feature. MIL applies the angle counter-clockwise. M_LENGTH Adds a length tolerance. When used with an arc or circle, the icon for this tolerance is: When used with a segment or edgel, the icon for this tolerance is: M_LENGTH validates the length of one of the following features: segment, edgel, circle, or arc. The length of a circle is its circumference. You should only use M_LENGTH with an edgel feature if it represents one continuous curve (path) that does not cross over itself. M_PARALLELISM Adds a parallelism tolerance. The icon for this tolerance is: A parallelism tolerance validates the degree to which two features are parallel. A parallelism tolerance can be applied between the following features: Two linear features (segments and lines). A linear feature (segment or line) and an edgel feature. For any combination of 2 linear features (segments and lines), M_PARALLELISM validates that the angle of the two features, relative to the global reference frame, is the same. The maximum tolerance parameter sets the valid angular range, from the nominal angle (0°) (that is, 0° +/- ValueMax). In this case, you should only set the maximum tolerance parameter, and set the minimum tolerance parameter to 0. The order of the features specified in the FeatureLabelArrayPtr parameter, as well as the start/end of the segments, is inconsequential. Note that, for parallelism tolerances between two linear features, angles are remapped to 0°; that is, the angle that is measured, and the angular range that you must provide, is the angle that is closest to 0°. For a linear feature (segment or line) and an edgel feature, M_PARALLELISM validates the width of the projection of the edgel feature on a theoretical line that is perpendicular to the segment or line feature. The minimum and maximum tolerance values set the valid projection width. The smaller the width, the more the edgel feature is parallel to the given segment or line feature. Typically, the minimum width value is set to 0. The width of the projection is in pixel or world units. The second feature specified in the FeatureLabelArrayPtr parameter must be edgel. M_PERIMETER_CONVEX_HULL Adds a perimeter tolerance, based on the convex hull, for the surface of an edgel, point, or circle feature. The icon for this tolerance is: M_PERIMETER_CONVEX_HULL validates that the surface perimeter (convex hull) of the specified feature (FeatureLabelArrayPtr) falls within the minimum and maximum limit values. M_PERIMETER_SIMPLE Adds a simple perimeter tolerance for the surface of an edgel, point, or circle feature. The icon for this tolerance is: M_PERIMETER_SIMPLE validates that the surface perimeter of the specified feature (FeatureLabelArrayPtr) falls within the minimum and maximum limit values. M_PERPENDICULARITY Adds a perpendicularity tolerance. The icon for this tolerance is: A perpendicularity tolerance validates the degree to which two features are perpendicular. A perpendicularity tolerance can be applied between the following features: Two linear features (segments and lines). A linear feature (segment or line) and an edgel feature. For any combination of 2 linear features (segments and lines), M_PERPENDICULARITY validates that the angle between the two features is 90°. The maximum tolerance parameter sets the valid angular range, from the nominal angle (90°) (that is, 90° +/- ValueMax). In this case, you should only set the maximum tolerance parameter, and set the minimum tolerance parameter to 0. The order of the features specified in the FeatureLabelArrayPtr parameter, as well as the start/end of the segments, is inconsequential. Note that, for perpendicularity tolerances between two linear features, angles are remapped to 90°; that is, the angle that is measured, and the angular range that you must provide, is the angle that is closest to 90°. For a linear feature (segment or line) and an edgel feature, M_PERPENDICULARITY validates the width of the projection of the edgel feature on a theoretical line that is parallel to the segment or line feature. The minimum and maximum tolerance values set the valid projection width. The smaller the width, the more the edgel feature is perpendicular to the given segment or line feature. Typically, the minimum width value is set to 0. The width of the projection is in pixel or world units. The second feature specified in the FeatureLabelArrayPtr parameter must be edgel. M_POSITION_X Adds a positioning tolerance, along the X-direction of the specified reference frame. The icon for this tolerance is: A positioning tolerance can be used to validate the geometric relationship between a reference frame and one of the following features: local frame, point, or circle. For a circle feature, only the position of its center is validated, not its contour. If you only specify one feature, MIL validates the geometric relationship between that feature and its reference frame. When using a positioning tolerance, the first element provided to the FeatureLabelArrayPtr parameter must be the label value of the reference frame, while the second element must be the label value of the feature to validate. If you only specify one feature, MIL validates the geometric relationship between that feature and its reference frame (every feature is associated to a reference frame). M_POSITION_Y Adds a positioning tolerance, along the Y-direction of the specified reference frame. The icon for this tolerance is: A positioning tolerance can be used to validate the geometric relationship between a reference frame and one of the following features: local frame, point, or circle. For a circle feature, only the position of its center is validated, not its contour. When using a positioning tolerance, the first element provided to the FeatureLabelArrayPtr parameter must be the label value of the reference frame, while the second element must be the label value of the feature to validate. If you only specify one feature, MIL validates the geometric relationship between that feature and its reference frame (every feature is associated to a reference frame). M_RADIUS Adds a radius tolerance. The icon for this tolerance is: M_RADIUS validates the radius of the specified arc or circle feature. The radius is the linear length between the circle or arc's center and perimeter. M_ROUNDNESS Adds a roundness tolerance. The icon for this tolerance is: M_ROUNDNESS validates the roundness of one of the following features: arc, circle, or edgel. MIL establishes a feature's roundness by calculating the distance between the inner and outer circular curves formed by the given feature. Note that the inner and outer curves are concentric. M_STRAIGHTNESS Adds a straightness tolerance. The icon for this tolerance is: M_STRAIGHTNESS validates the straightness of one of the following features: segment or edgel. This is done by calculating the distance between the two parallel lines that are formed by the inner and outer boundaries of the feature. The angle of the two parallel lines is chosen such that the distance between them is the smallest. To modify a geometric tolerance, the ToleranceType parameter can be set to the following value. In this case, you must set the ToleranceLabel parameter to the label of an existing tolerance. For modifying a geometric tolerance Value Description M_MODIFY Modifies the features that the tolerance uses, and the tolerance's minimum and maximum limit values. You cannot modify only the features or only the limits. Use FeatureLabelArrayPtr, SubFeatureIndexArrayPtr, ValueMin, and ValueMax to specify the new features and limits. ToleranceLabel Specifies the label of the target tolerance. For labeling the tolerance Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that MIL automatically selects the tolerance's label value. Once a tolerance is added, you can inquire its label using MmetInquire() with the tolerance's index and M_LABEL_VALUE. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the label value. Each tolerance must have a unique label otherwise you will get an error. You can have an extremely high number of labels (up to M_MET_TOLERANCE_ID_MAX). ValueMin Specifies the minimum value of the geometric tolerance. For specifying the minimum geometric tolerance Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value Specifies the minimum value. ValueMax Specifies the maximum value of the geometric tolerance. For specifying the maximum geometric tolerance Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value Specifies the maximum value. FeatureLabelArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(SizeOfArray) Specifies the array that holds the label values of the features whose relationship to validate. The features must have already been added to the metrology template of the metrology context. To add a feature, use MmetAddFeature(). The specified features, whose relationship you want to validate, can be considered the base features of the tolerance. SubFeatureIndexArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(SizeOfArray) Specifies the array that holds the index values of the multiple features' subfeatures whose relationship the added tolerance will validate. For non-multiple features (single features), specify 0 as the index. If the tolerance validates the relationship between only single features (there are no multiple features), set SubFeatureIndexArrayPtr to M_NULL. SizeOfArray Specifies the size of the arrays that hold the information that will be used to add the geometric tolerance (FeatureLabelArrayPtr and SubFeatureIndexArrayPtr). When using a standard vector (std::vector) overload function in C++, you can pass M_DEFAULT to this parameter and MIL will automatically determine the size based on the number of items in the vector passed to the FeatureLabelArrayPtr or SubFeatureIndexArrayPtr parameter. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; milmetrol.lib. DLL Requires mil.dll; milmetrol.dll.

Syntax MIL_ID MmetAlloc( MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Type, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*ContextOrRegionMetIdPtr //out ) Description This function allocates a metrology context or a derived metrology region object on the specified system. A metrology context contains all the information necessary to perform an MmetCalculate() operation, including global processing settings and a metrology template; the metrology template defines the set of features and geometric tolerances against which MmetCalculate() validates and measures objects in an image. A derived metrology region object is an optional MIL object that stores specialized information about metrology regions (ROIs). When you allocate a metrology context, MIL automatically creates a global frame, assigns it an index of 0, and labels it M_GLOBAL_FRAME. The global frame is the first coordinate system used to define the features to add to the metrology template of a metrology context. The global frame always exists and you cannot delete it. If the target image is not calibrated, the global frame's default origin (0,0) is aligned with the center of the top-left corner pixel of the target image. If the target image is calibrated, the global frame's default origin is aligned with the origin of the relative (world) coordinate system. To add features (either physically measured or constructed) or geometric tolerances to the metrology template of a metrology context, use MmetAddFeature() or MmetAddTolerance(), respectively. To adjust metrology context, feature, and geometric tolerance settings, use MmetControl(). For physically measured features, you must also use MmetSetRegion() to set the metrology region that delimits the area in the target image from which to establish the feature. You can set the metrology region using explicit values or a 2D graphics list; you can also derive a metrology region using other features. If you are using an explicitly-defined or a 2D graphics list metrology region, you just need to allocate a metrology context, and specify it when you call MmetSetRegion(). If you are deriving a metrology region using other features, you must also allocate a derived metrology region object and specify it, as well as the metrology context, when you call MmetSetRegion(). When the metrology context or the derived metrology region object is no longer required, release it using MmetFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during allocation; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the metrology context or the derived metrology region object's lifetime and you must not manually free it. Parameters Parameters SysId Specifies the system on which to allocate the metrology context or the derived metrology region object. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the system Value Description M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). Type Specifies whether to allocate a metrology context or a derived metrology region object. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying whether to allocate a metrology context or a derived metrology region object Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_CONTEXT. M_CONTEXT Specifies a metrology context. M_DERIVED_GEOMETRY_REGION Specifies a derived metrology region object. This object is only required when a geometry setting of a metrology region must be derived from one or more features. This type of metrology region is referred to as a derived metrology region. Use MmetSetRegion() with M_FROM_DERIVED_GEOMETRY_REGION to associate the derived metrology region with a measured feature. ContextOrRegionMetIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the metrology context or the derived metrology region object identifier or specifies the data type that the function should use to return the metrology context or the derived metrology region object identifier. For retrieving the identifier or specifying how to return it Value Description M_NULL Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated metrology context or the derived metrology region object ; in this case, a standard MIL identifier of type MIL_ID is returned. M_UNIQUE_ID Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated metrology context or the derived metrology region object ; in this case, a MIL smart identifier of type MIL_UNIQUE_MET_ID is returned instead of a standard MIL identifier. This setting is only available when using C++11 (or later). A MIL smart identifier manages the lifespan of the MIL object it owns (similar to a std::unique_ptr). Note, you can use a MIL smart identifier as though it were a standard MIL identifier, except that you cannot use it to manually free the metrology context or the derived metrology region object (it is freed automatically). For more information, see the MIL smart identifiers subsection of the MIL custom data types, void pointers, extensions, and portability functions section of Chapter 2: Building an application. Address in which to write the metrology context identifier Specifies the address of a MIL_ID in which to write the identifier of the allocated metrology context. If allocation fails, M_NULL is written as the identifier. Address in which to write the metrology derived geometry region identifier Specifies the address of a MIL_ID in which to write the identifier of the allocated metrology derived region object. If allocation fails, M_NULL is written as the identifier. Return value The returned value is the metrology context or the derived metrology region object identifier either as a standard identifier (MIL_ID) or a smart identifier (MIL_UNIQUE_MET_ID). If allocation fails, M_NULL is returned (or nullptr if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified). Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; milmetrol.lib.

Syntax void MmetCalculate( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;TargetBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;ResultId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function calculates features and validates geometric tolerances. For physically measured features, MmetCalculate() uses the target image's edge map. For more information on edge maps, see the Extracting the edges section of Chapter 10: Edge Finder. If a metrology context contains only constructed features, the TargetBufId parameter can be set to M_NULL. This is useful, for example, when performing calculations on edgel features constructed from edgels or points established using other MIL modules or third party software. To control the Metrology module's calculation and validation behavior, you can set context constraints using MmetControl(). You can also use MmetControl() to alter settings for features and tolerances that you have already added to the context. To add features to the context, use MmetAddFeature(). To add geometric tolerances to the context and define geometric relationships between features, use MmetAddTolerance(). Results of a metrology calculation are stored in the specified result buffer and can be obtained using MmetGetResult(). If the target image is not calibrated, results are calculated in the pixel coordinate system (pixel units). If the target image is calibrated, results are calculated in the world coordinate system (real-world units), but they can be retrieved in either world or pixel units. Note that, if the target image is calibrated, feature values, metrology regions, and tolerances are considered as real-world values and are retrieved in world units. Note that in the presence of distortion, some results are meaningless when converted from real-world to pixel units (for example, angle and scale results). For example, if a feature appears warped in the target image, but the camera calibration context compensates for this during the calculation, the resulting angle is meaningful in the real-world coordinate system, and meaningless in the pixel coordinate system. If complex distortions exist, you must first correct the image before using it with the Metrology module. Parameters Parameters ContextId Specifies the identifier of the metrology context. The metrology context must have been previously allocated on the required system using MmetAlloc(). TargetBufId Specifies the identifier of the target image buffer from which to extract edges to calculate physically measured features and validate geometric tolerances. If a metrology context contains features which are only constructed, you can set this parameter to M_NULL. If you don't provide a target image and the context contains any measured features, an error is generated. Typically, the target image buffer should be 1-band 8-bit unsigned. Other buffer depths and types are generally accepted, but can slightly decrease performance. When the target image buffer is 32-bit float, metrology uses floating-point precision calculations. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it (MbufSetRegion()). Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. You can only use metrology regions established with MmetSetRegion(). ResultId Specifies the metrology result buffer in which to write the results of the calculation. The metrology result buffer must have been previously allocated on the required system using MmetAllocResult(). ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT.

Syntax void MmetControl( MIL_ID&nbsp;MetId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;LabelOrIndex, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlType, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;ControlValue //in ) Description This function sets the specified control for a metrology context, a derived metrology region object, features, tolerances, or a result buffer. These settings control the execution of MmetCalculate(), and affect how results are retrieved by MmetGetResult(). You can also use this function to specify whether features can be drawn with MmetDraw(). Most of the control type settings in MmetControl() can be inquired using MmetInquire(). If a camera calibration context is associated with the target image, set values in real-world units (for example, tolerance values, warning values, and positional values). Otherwise, use pixel units. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler) in 64-bit mode, MmetControl() internally calls the MIL_DOUBLE version of this function (MmetControlDouble()). If you need to pass large integer values (including pointers), call the MIL_INT64 version of this function (MmetControlInt64()). Parameters Parameters MetId Specifies the identifier of the metrology context, the derived metrology region object, or the result buffer whose settings you want to control. The metrology context or the derived metrology region object must have been previously allocated on the required system using MmetAlloc(). The metrology result buffer must have been previously allocated on the required system using MmetAllocResult(). LabelOrIndex Specifies to control the metrology context, the derived metrology region object, features, tolerances, or the result buffer. Set this parameter to one of the following values. For specifying what to control Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_CONTEXT. M_FEATURE_INDEX( MIL_INT FeatureIndex ) Specifies the index value of an existing individual feature. Parameters FeatureIndex This parameter specifies the index of the individual feature to which the control settings will be applied. You can set this parameter to the following: Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the index of the individual feature. Note that the index of the global frame is 0. M_FEATURE_LABEL( MIL_INT FeatureLabel ) Specifies the label value of an existing individual feature. Parameters FeatureLabel This parameter specifies the label of the individual feature to which the control settings will be applied. You can set this parameter to the following: Value &gt; 0 Specifies the label of the individual feature. M_TOLERANCE_INDEX( MIL_INT ToleranceIndex ) Specifies the index value of an existing individual tolerance. Parameters ToleranceIndex This parameter specifies the index of the individual tolerance to which the control settings will be applied. You can set this parameter to the following: Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the index of the individual tolerance. M_TOLERANCE_LABEL( MIL_INT ToleranceLabel ) Specifies the label value of an existing individual tolerance. Parameters ToleranceLabel This parameter specifies the label of the individual tolerance to which the control settings will be applied. You can set this parameter to the following: Value &gt; 0 Specifies the label of the individual tolerance. M_ALL_FEATURES Applies the specified control setting to all features. This value should only be used with M_DELETE. M_ALL_TOLERANCES Applies the specified control setting to all tolerances. M_CONTEXT Controls a setting of the metrology context, which has been set using the MetId parameter. M_DERIVED_GEOMETRY_REGION Controls a setting of the derived metrology region object, which has been set using the MetId parameter. M_GENERAL Controls a setting of a metrology result buffer. The setting is applied to all feature and tolerance results in the metrology result buffer. When using M_GENERAL, MetId must specify a metrology result buffer. M_GLOBAL_FRAME Applies the specified control setting to the global frame of the context. In this case, MetId must specify a metrology context. M_MEASURED_FEATURES Applies the specified control setting to all measured features. In this case, MetId must specify a metrology context. ControlType Specifies the type of control to set. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ControlValue Specifies the required value for the control. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Parameter associations The tables below list possible values for the ControlType and ControlValue parameters. For controlling general context settings For controlling global processing settings For controlling features For controlling constructed edgel features For setting the geometry of the derived metrology region For setting the geometry data of the derived metrology region For controlling geometric tolerances For controlling features or geometric tolerances For controlling clone transformations For controlling results For deleting features and tolerances The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to control general metrology context settings. For controlling general context settings, the LabelOrIndex parameter must be set to M_CONTEXT and the MetId parameter must be set to a metrology context. For controlling general context settings ControlType Description ControlValue M_ASSOCIATED_CALIBRATION Associates the specified camera calibration context with the template reference of the metrology context. To specify the template reference, use MmetControl() with M_TEMPLATE_REFERENCE_ID. When saving the metrology context, if you do not save the camera calibration context associated with the template reference (MmetSave() or MmetStream() with M_WITH_CALIBRATION), you must re-associate the template reference with its camera calibration context after restoring the context (MmetRestore() or MmetStream()). Note that you can also associate a camera calibration context to the template reference using other MIL mechanisms ( Mcal...()); in this case, M_ASSOCIATED_CALIBRATION is ignored. You cannot associate the template reference with a calibrated context whose Y-axis has been inverted using McalGrid() with M_Y_AXIS_COUNTER_CLOCKWISE. M_DEFAULT Same as M_NULL. M_NULL Removes the association to the camera calibration. MIL Calibration context identifier Specifies the identifier of the camera calibration context to associate with the template reference of the metrology context. M_TEMPLATE_REFERENCE_ID Associates a template reference to the context. The template reference is a companion buffer (typically an image) useful for training the metrology context and drawing the results on a typical target image. Note this control type creates an internal copy of the buffer associated with the metrology context. Freeing the buffer passed to MmetControl() (using MbufFree()) will not effect this internal copy. M_NULL Releases the template reference buffer. MIL image identifier Specifies the identifier of the buffer. M_TIMEOUT Sets the maximum measurement and validation time for MmetCalculate(), in msec. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies an infinite amount of measurement and validation time. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the maximum measurement and validation time, in msec. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to control processing settings for a measured feature. For controlling processing settings, the LabelOrIndex parameter can be set to M_MEASURED_FEATURES or an existing measured feature label or index using M_FEATURE_LABEL() or M_FEATURE_INDEX(). The MetId parameter must be set to a metrology context. For controlling global processing settings ControlType Description ControlValue M_CHAIN_ALL_NEIGHBORS Sets whether edge chains are built with as much edgel information as possible. An edge chain refers to the set of connected edgels that form an edge. Edge chains are built using an 8-connected lattice. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ENABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that edge chains are built with the least amount of edgel information possible. M_ENABLE Specifies that edge chains are built with as much edgel information as possible. Enabling M_CHAIN_ALL_NEIGHBORS can result in greater accuracy, since edge chains can contain more information, though calculations can take slightly longer. M_EXTRACTION_SCALE Sets the scale of the image at which to do the edge extraction. Once the extraction is complete, the results are scaled to the original scale of the image. An extraction scale less than one can speed calculations but can be less reliable. The default extraction scale setting is typically sufficient. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the extraction scale. M_FILL_GAP_ANGLE Sets the aperture angle where the feature extraction searches for edgel extremity candidates when filling gaps in features. That is, M_FILL_GAP_ANGLE, along with M_FILL_GAP_DISTANCE, define a region where two chain extremities can be linked. Note that two chain extremities can only be linked if both are included in the search region of the other. For more information on filling gaps, see the Filling the edge gaps subsection of the Customizing the edge extraction settings section of Chapter 10: Edge Finder. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 90.0°. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 360.0 Specifies the aperture angle, in degrees. M_FILL_GAP_DISTANCE Sets the maximum distance radius where the feature extraction searches for edgel extremity candidates when filling gaps in features. That is, M_FILL_GAP_DISTANCE, along with M_FILL_GAP_ANGLE, define a region where two chain extremities can be linked. Note that two chain extremities can only be linked if both are included in the search region of the other. For more information on filling gaps, see the Filling the edge gaps subsection of the Customizing the edge extraction settings section of Chapter 10: Edge Finder. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value. Typically, the default value is 0.0 pixels, however for an M_MEASURED M_POINT feature, the default value is 3.0 pixels. M_INFINITE Specifies an infinite maximum distance radius. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the maximum distance radius, in pixels. Note that generally, you should not set the distance to a large value. Typically, you would set M_FILL_GAP_DISTANCE to a value in the range of 2 to 5 pixels. M_FILTER_SMOOTHNESS Sets the degree of smoothness (strength of denoising) applied by the edge extraction filter during the neighborhood operation. The smoothing operation evens out rough edges and reduces noise; in effect, the smoothness factor affects which edges are extracted. For more information on smoothing edges, see the Smoothing for IIR filters subsection of the Customizing the edge extraction settings section of Chapter 10: Edge Finder. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 50.0. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the smoothness value. A value of 100.0 results in a strong noise reduction effect, while a value of 0.0 has almost no noise reduction effect. M_FILTER_TYPE Sets the type of filter used to extract edges. The type of filter determines the distribution of the neighborhood's influence. It establishes the contribution of each neighboring pixel to the edge calculation. For more information on filtering, see the Filter type subsection of the Customizing the edge extraction settings section of Chapter 10: Edge Finder. M_DEFAULT Same as M_SHEN. M_DERICHE Specifies a Deriche infinite support filter. M_FREI_CHEN Specifies a Frei Chen filter. M_PREWITT Specifies a Prewitt filter. M_SHEN Specifies a Shen-Castan infinite support exponential filter. M_SOBEL Specifies a Sobel filter. M_FLOAT_MODE Sets whether to perform all edge extraction operations using floating-point precision calculations. For more information on using floating-point precision when extracting edges, see the Calculating and retrieving results section of Chapter 10: Edge Finder. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that all edge extractions are not forced to be performed using floating-point precision calculations. M_ENABLE Specifies that all edge extractions are forced to be performed using floating-point precision calculations. M_MAGNITUDE_TYPE Sets how to calculate the magnitude of the edge at each edgel position. For more information on the magnitude, see the Magnitude type subsection of the Customizing the edge extraction settings section of Chapter 10: Edge Finder. M_DEFAULT Same as M_SQR_NORM. M_NORM Specifies that the magnitude will be used. M_SQR_NORM Specifies that the square of the magnitude will be used. M_REGION_ACCURACY_HIGH Sets whether to use high accuracy to define the metrology region associated with a feature, when dealing with a calibrated image. When using high accuracy, the metrology region closely follows the image distortion; when using low accuracy, the Metrology module approximates the distortion. For example, a rectangular metrology region remains a rectangle and a circular metrology region becomes the best approximated elliptic region. M_REGION_ACCURACY_HIGH also applies when drawing the metrology region, using MmetDraw() with Operation set to M_DRAW_REGION. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ENABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that high accuracy is not used when defining a metrology region. This value is recommended when the image distortion of the calibrated image is minor. This typically results in a quicker processing time. M_ENABLE Specifies that high accuracy is used when defining a metrology region. M_THRESHOLD_MODE Sets the threshold of the edge extraction. For more information on thresholding edges, see the Thresholding subsection of the Customizing the edge extraction settings section of Chapter 10: Edge Finder. M_DEFAULT Same as M_HIGH. M_DISABLE Specifies no threshold. All edges are extracted. M_HIGH Specifies a high threshold. M_HIGH should be used for images with some contrast variations, noise, and non-uniform illumination. M_HIGH always results in a lower (or equal) number of edgels than M_MEDIUM. M_LOW Specifies a low threshold. All edges over a minimum noise-based estimated threshold are extracted. M_LOW always results in a lower (or equal) number of edgels than M_DISABLE. M_MEDIUM Specifies a medium threshold. M_MEDIUM should be used for multi-contrast images, or for images with a lot of noise or non-uniform illumination. M_MEDIUM always results in a lower (or equal) number of edgels than M_LOW. M_USER_DEFINED Specifies that the threshold values will be user-defined. Set the threshold values with M_THRESHOLD_VALUE_LOW and M_THRESHOLD_VALUE_HIGH. M_VERY_HIGH Specifies a very high threshold. Only the strongest edges in the image are extracted. M_VERY_HIGH always results in a lower (or equal) number of edgels than M_HIGH. M_THRESHOLD_TYPE Sets the type of hysteresis threshold used when performing the edge extraction. Edge chains are built such that the magnitude values of all connected edgels are stronger than a lower bound threshold value and such that at least one of the edgel's magnitude in each edge chain is stronger than a upper bound threshold value. Note that M_THRESHOLD_TYPE sets how to use the lower and upper threshold bounds, while M_THRESHOLD_MODE defines what the bounds are. For more information on thresholding, see the Thresholding subsection of the Customizing the edge extraction settings section of Chapter 10: Edge Finder. M_DEFAULT Same as M_HYSTERESIS. M_FULL_HYSTERESIS Specifies that the lower bound threshold value is 0.0. M_HYSTERESIS Specifies that both the lower bound threshold value and the upper bound threshold value will be used. M_NO_HYSTERESIS Specifies that the lower bound threshold value is equal to the upper bound threshold value. M_THRESHOLD_VALUE_HIGH Sets the upper bound of the hysteresis threshold value. M_THRESHOLD_VALUE_HIGH is ignored unless MmetControl() with M_THRESHOLD_MODE is set to M_USER_DEFINED. Note that lower threshold values result in a more sensitive edgel detection; that is, a higher (or equal) number of edgels are detected. For more information on thresholding, see the Thresholding subsection of the Customizing the edge extraction settings section of Chapter 10: Edge Finder. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value Specifies the upper bound of the hysteresis threshold. M_THRESHOLD_VALUE_LOW Sets the lower bound of the hysteresis threshold value. M_THRESHOLD_VALUE_LOW is ignored unless MmetControl() with M_THRESHOLD_MODE is set to M_USER_DEFINED. Note that lower threshold values result in a more sensitive edgel detection; that is, a higher (or equal) number of edgels are detected. For more information on thresholding, see the Thresholding subsection of the Customizing the edge extraction settings section of Chapter 10: Edge Finder. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value Specifies the lower bound of the hysteresis threshold. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to control how the features are calculated. For controlling features, the LabelOrIndex parameter can be set to the following: M_GLOBAL_FRAME or an existing feature label or index using M_FEATURE_LABEL() or M_FEATURE_INDEX(). The MetId parameter must be set to a metrology context. For controlling features ControlType Description ControlValue M_ACTIVE Sets whether to enable or disable the feature for calculation. M_DISABLE Specifies not to calculate the feature. In this case, the feature is not calculated and the status of the feature (M_STATUS) will return M_FAIL. This is also the case for the status of all the derived features and tolerances, if any. M_ENABLE Specifies to calculate the feature. This is the default value. M_ANGLE_END Sets the end angle of a constructed arc. The angle is relative to the reference frame's X-axis and follows the counter-clockwise convention. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 360.0°. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 360.0 Specifies the angle, in degrees. M_ANGLE_START Sets the start angle of a constructed arc. The angle is relative to the reference frame's X-axis and follows the counter-clockwise convention. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0°. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt; 360.0 Specifies the angle, in degrees. M_EDGEL_ANGLE_RANGE Sets the angular range within which an edgel's gradient angle must fall for MIL to consider it an active edgel. Active edgels apply to physically measured features and constructed features based on physically measured edgels or based on external edgels. Note that this control type is ignored for points (edgels with no angle information) in an external edgel feature. By default, MIL measures the specified angular range, in the counter clockwise direction, relative to the metrology ROI's orientation. To change the relative angle from which to measure the angular range, use M_EDGEL_RELATIVE_ANGLE. In the following examples, the angular range is 60.0° and the relative angle is the same as the region's orientation. Note that for the ring-sector region, the orientation is radial. Note that constructed edgel features are not built from a region, but from a specified measured feature. Therefore in this case, the region's orientation refers to the orientation of the region from which its specified measured feature was built. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 180.0°. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 360.0 Specifies the angular range, in degrees. M_EDGEL_DENOISING_MODE Sets how to denoise edgels. Denoising refers to establishing and eliminating noisy (unwanted) edgels. This setting applies to all physically measured features and constructed edgel features. M_DEFAULT Same as M_NULL. M_NULL Specifies no denoising. M_GAUSSIAN Specifies a Gaussian type of denoising. M_MEAN Specifies a mean type of denoising. M_MEDIAN Specifies a median type of denoising. M_EDGEL_DENOISING_RADIUS Sets the radius by which to denoise edgels. This setting only has an effect if M_EDGEL_DENOISING_MODE is set to a value other than its default (which is M_NULL). This setting applies to all physically measured features and constructed edgel features. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 10.0. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the radius, in pixels. M_EDGEL_DENOISING_USE_ORDER Sets whether MIL should use and maintain the order of the edgels when denoising them. This setting only has an effect if M_EDGEL_DENOISING_MODE is set to a value other than its default (which is M_NULL). This setting applies to all physically measured features and constructed edgel features. M_DISABLE Specifies that MIL should not use and maintain the order of the edgels when denoising them. M_ENABLE Specifies that MIL should use and maintain the order of the edgels when denoising them. This can improve the speed and accuracy of the denoising. This also ensures that the denoising itself does not reorder the edgels; keeping the original order can be useful for future operations. This is the default value. M_EDGEL_RELATIVE_ANGLE Sets the relative angle from which to measure the gradient angle range (M_EDGEL_ANGLE_RANGE). You can use M_EDGEL_RELATIVE_ANGLE, along with M_EDGEL_ANGLE_RANGE, to select the active edgels of a physically measured feature or the active edgels of a constructed feature based on physically measured edgels or based on external edgels. Typically, the relative angle is the same as the region's orientation. For an example on how M_EDGEL_RELATIVE_ANGLE is applied, along with the gradient angle range, see M_EDGEL_ANGLE_RANGE. Note that this control type is ignored for points (edgels with no angle information) in an external edgel feature. Note that constructed edgel features are not built from a region, but from a specified measured feature. Therefore in this case, the region's orientation refers to the orientation of the region from which its specified measured feature was built. M_DEFAULT Same as M_SAME. M_REVERSE Specifies that the gradient angle range is measured relative to the reverse angle (orientation) of the region of interest (+ 180°). M_SAME Specifies that the gradient angle range is measured relative to the same angle (orientation) as the region of interest. M_SAME_OR_REVERSE Specifies that the gradient angle range is measured relative to either the same or the reverse angle (orientation) of the region of interest. M_EDGEL_SELECTION_RANK Sets the edgels to select relative to the orientation of the metrology region. The metrology region is scanned column by column, and the specified edgel encountered within a column is selected. Note that this control type takes effect after M_EDGEL_RELATIVE_ANGLE and M_EDGEL_ANGLE_RANGE are satisfied. M_EDGEL_SELECTION_RANK applies to M_RECTANGLE derived metrology regions. In the following example, there are multiple edges in the metrology region. The solid gray line illustrates the edgels selected when M_EDGEL_SELECTION_RANK is set to 1; the dotted gray line illustrates the edgels selected when M_EDGEL_SELECTION_RANK is set to 2. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that all edgels are selected. M_LAST Selects the last edgel in each column, relative to the metrology region. Value &gt; 0 Specifies which edgels to select, based on their rank, relative to the metrology region. M_EDGEL_TYPE Sets the type of edgels to use when building constructed edgel features from a measured base feature using MmetAddFeature() with M_COPY_FEATURE_EDGELS. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ACTIVE_EDGELS. M_ACTIVE_EDGELS Specifies to use the active edgels of the measured feature's metrology region. Active edgels must satisfy all edgel constraints (M_EDGEL_ANGLE_RANGE and M_EDGEL_RELATIVE_ANGLE). M_ALL_EDGELS Specifies to use all the edgels of the measured feature's metrology region. M_FITTED_EDGELS Specifies to use the fitted edgels of the measured feature's metrology region. The fitted edgels are those active edgels used by the fit operation to define a measured feature. Fitted edgels must satisfy all edgel constraints (M_EDGEL_ANGLE_RANGE and M_EDGEL_RELATIVE_ANGLE) and fit constraints (M_FIT_...). M_FIT_COVERAGE_MIN Sets the approximate portion of the feature that must be covered by fitted edgels. In the following example, about 50.0% of the segment feature covers the edgels. The actual coverage that results from this setting depends on the scale of the image at which the feature edges were extracted, as specified with M_EXTRACTION_SCALE; a scale of 1 provides the best estimation. M_FIT_COVERAGE_MIN is valid for all fit operations for physically measured or constructed features. For constructed features using a fit operation performed on multiple physically measured edgel features, the accuracy of the minimum fit coverage is based on the average of each feature's extraction scale. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0%. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the minimum coverage, as a percentage. M_FIT_DISTANCE_MAX Sets the greatest possible gap between an active edgel and an iterative fit for the edgel to be considered during the next iteration. The higher the value, the farther away an active edgel can be. M_FIT_DISTANCE_MAX is valid for all fit operations for physically measured or constructed features. You can specify M_FIT_DISTANCE_MAX when M_FIT_TYPE is set to M_STANDARD_FIT. This setting can alter the precision of the edge that is ultimately fit; however, it might not reliably discard outliers (outlier edgels/points) when they significantly impact the initial fit (the first iteration of the fit). When dealing with a lot of outliers, use a robust best fit (M_ROBUST_FIT). M_DEFAULT Same as M_INFINITE. M_INFINITE Specifies no maximum distance. Value Specifies the maximum distance, in pixel units. M_FIT_DISTANCE_OUTLIERS Sets whether to automatically determine the distance that establishes outliers (edgels/points), or to use a user-defined distance. Outliers are excluded from the robust best fit. This setting only applies to features built using MmetAddFeature() with M_FIT; also, M_FIT_TYPE must be set to M_ROBUST_FIT. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_AUTO Specifies that MIL automatically determines the distance. M_USER_DEFINED Specifies that the distance is set with M_FIT_DISTANCE_OUTLIERS_VALUE. M_FIT_DISTANCE_OUTLIERS_VALUE Sets an explicit distance value that MIL uses to establish outliers (outlier edgels/points), which are excluded from the robust best fit. This only applies to features built using MmetAddFeature() with M_FIT; also, M_FIT_TYPE must be set to M_ROBUST_FIT, and M_FIT_DISTANCE_OUTLIERS must be set to M_USER_DEFINED. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 4.0. Value Specifies the distance; value must be greater than 0.0. M_FIT_INTERNAL_NUMBER_OF_POINTS Sets the minimum number of points from which MIL performs the robust fit to build the feature. This only applies to features built using MmetAddFeature() with M_FIT; also, M_FIT_TYPE must be set to M_ROBUST_FIT. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_AUTO Specifies that MIL automatically determines the number of points. For a segment, MIL uses 2 points. For a circle or arc, MIL uses 3. Value Specifies the number of points. Less points typically result in faster fit calculations. For a segment, there is a 2 point minimum, and for a circle or arc, there is a 3 point minimum. M_FIT_ITERATIONS_MAX Sets the maximum number of fit iterations used to compute the feature. The more iterations, the better the fit, but the slower the calculation. M_FIT_ITERATIONS_MAX is valid for all fit operations for physically measured or constructed features. This setting can alter the precision of the edge that is ultimately fit; however, it might not reliably discard outliers (outlier edgels/points) when they significantly impact the initial fit (the first iteration of the fit). When dealing with a lot of outliers, use a robust best fit (M_ROBUST_FIT). M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_AUTO Specifies that the maximum number of fit iterations will be automatically determined. Value &gt;= 1 Specifies the maximum number of fit iterations. Only integer values are accepted. For a M_STANDARD_FIT, a setting of one will consider all edgels/points in the fit. Settings higher than one will progressively eliminate outlying edgels (outlier edgels/points) in the fit. M_FIT_TYPE Sets the type of best fit with which to build the feature. This only applies to features built using MmetAddFeature() with M_FIT. M_DEFAULT Same as M_STANDARD_FIT. M_ROBUST_FIT Specifies a robust best fit. This can be effective when dealing with outliers (outlier edgels/points). When you use a robust best fit, you can further control how the feature is built, by specifying M_FIT_DISTANCE_OUTLIERS, M_FIT_DISTANCE_OUTLIERS_VALUE, M_FIT_INTERNAL_NUMBER_OF_POINTS, and M_FIT_ITERATIONS_MAX. This is not a valid control value for features of type M_POINT or M_EDGEL. M_STANDARD_FIT Specifies a standard best fit. In this case, more importance is typically given to the edgels whose gradient orientation follows the region's orientation. However, when adding a segment feature in an M_INFINITE metrology region with an M_RADIAL orientation, or in an M_RING_SECTOR metrology region, more importance is given to the edgels whose gradient orientation is more perpendicular to the radial direction. M_FIT_VARIATION_MAX Sets the maximum allowable difference in the value of the feature's underlying coefficients, from one fit iteration to the next. If at least one coefficient of the feature varies more, between two consecutive fit iterations, than the specified value, the iteration process will continue. Note that: An arc feature has 5 coefficients: the X-coordinate of its center, the Y-coordinate of its center, its radius, its start angle, and its end angle. A circle feature has 3 coefficients: the X-coordinate of its center, the Y-coordinate of its center and its radius. A segment feature has 4 coefficients: the X-coordinate of its start point, the Y-coordinate of its start point, the X-coordinate of its end point, and the Y-coordinate of its end point. These coefficients are the same as those required when building the corresponding features with a parametric operation. M_FIT_VARIATION_MAX is valid for all fit operations for physically measured or constructed features. You can specify M_FIT_VARIATION_MAX when M_FIT_TYPE is set to M_STANDARD_FIT. This setting can alter the precision of the edge that is ultimately fit; however, it might not reliably discard outliers (outlier edgels/points) when they significantly impact the initial fit (the first iteration of the fit). When dealing with a lot of outliers, use a robust best fit (M_ROBUST_FIT). M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_AUTO Specifies that the maximum variation will be determined automatically. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the maximum variation, as a percentage. M_LINE_A Sets the coefficient A of the line equation for a parametrically constructed line. The line equation is: A x + B y + C = 0. If you use the default for all coefficients (A = 0, B = 1, and C = 0), MIL constructs a line that runs along the X-axis of the reference frame. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value Specifies the coefficient's value. M_LINE_B Sets the coefficient B of the line equation for a parametrically constructed line. The line equation is: A x + B y + C = 0. If you use the default for all coefficients (A = 0, B = 1, and C = 0), MIL constructs a line that runs along the X-axis of the reference frame. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value Specifies the coefficient's value. M_LINE_BISECTOR_TYPE Sets how to construct a line feature when building it as a bisector. This only applies when using MmetAddFeature() with M_CONSTRUCTED set to M_LINE and M_BISECTOR, and specifying two lines as the base features. M_DEFAULT Same as M_FEATURE_ORDER. M_BIGGEST_ANGLE Specifies that the newly constructed line is built at the middle of the biggest angle formed by the two lines specified as base features. M_FEATURE_ORDER Specifies that the newly constructed line is built according to the order in which you specified the two line base features; that is, at the middle of the angle formed between the first and second specified lines. M_SMALLEST_ANGLE Specifies that the newly constructed line is built at the middle of the smallest angle formed by the two lines specified as base features. M_LINE_C Sets the coefficient C of the line equation for a parametrically constructed line. The line equation is: A x + B y + C = 0. If you use the default for all coefficients (A = 0, B = 1, and C = 0), MIL constructs a line that runs along the X-axis of the reference frame. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. -0.5 * MIL_INT32_MAX &lt;= Value &lt;= 0.5 * MIL_INT32_MAX Specifies the coefficient's value. If the value that you need to specify for C is out of range, you can multiply A, B, and C by (0.5 *MIL_INT32_MAX) / C to normalize the coefficients. M_NUMBER_MAX Sets the maximum number of subfeatures to calculate for a multiple feature. Note that M_NUMBER_MAX is valid for point features only. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1. Value Specifies the maximum number of subfeatures. This value must be greater than 1 for measured multiple point features. M_NUMBER_MIN Sets the minimum number of subfeatures to calculate for a multiple feature. Note that M_NUMBER_MIN is valid for point features only. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the minimum number of subfeatures. This value must be greater than 1 for measured multiple point features. M_OCCURRENCE Sets the point to use if there is more than one candidate when adding a constructed point feature built at the intersection of two base features (MmetAddFeature() with M_POINT and M_INTERSECTION or M_EXTENDED_INTERSECTION). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the index value. M_POSITION Sets the position, along the contour of the specified base feature, at which to construct the point feature (MmetAddFeature() with M_POINT and M_POSITION_ABSOLUTE or M_POSITION_RELATIVE). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. Value Specifies the position value. Set the position as a linear value when using M_POSITION_ABSOLUTE and as a percentage when using M_POSITION_RELATIVE. M_POSITION_END_X Sets the X-coordinate of the end point of a segment constructed using MmetAddFeature() with M_PARAMETRIC. If you use the default for all positions (M_POSITION_START_X = -1.0, M_POSITION_START_Y = 0.0, M_POSITION_END_X = 1.0, and M_POSITION_END_Y = 0), MIL constructs a segment with a length of 2 (-1.0 to 1.0); the segment is centered on the origin of the reference frame and runs along the reference frame's X-axis. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value Specifies the X-coordinate, in pixel or world units. M_POSITION_END_Y Sets the Y-coordinate of the end point of a segment constructed using MmetAddFeature() with M_PARAMETRIC. If you use the default for all positions (M_POSITION_START_X = -1.0, M_POSITION_START_Y = 0.0, M_POSITION_END_X = 1.0, and M_POSITION_END_Y = 0), MIL constructs a segment with a length of 2 (-1.0 to 1.0); the segment is centered on the origin of the reference frame and runs along the reference frame's X-axis. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value Specifies the Y-coordinate, in pixel or world units. M_POSITION_START_X Sets the X-coordinate of the start point of a segment constructed using MmetAddFeature() with M_PARAMETRIC. If you use the default for all positions (M_POSITION_START_X = -1.0, M_POSITION_START_Y = 0.0, M_POSITION_END_X = 1.0, and M_POSITION_END_Y = 0), MIL constructs a segment with a length of 2 (-1.0 to 1.0); the segment is centered on the origin of the reference frame and runs along the reference frame's X-axis. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is -1.0. Value Specifies the X-coordinate, in pixel or world units. M_POSITION_START_Y Sets the Y-coordinate of the start point of a segment constructed using MmetAddFeature() with M_PARAMETRIC. If you use the default for all positions (M_POSITION_START_X = -1.0, M_POSITION_START_Y = 0.0, M_POSITION_END_X = 1.0, and M_POSITION_END_Y = 0), MIL constructs a segment with a length of 2 (-1.0 to 1.0); the segment is centered on the origin of the reference frame and runs along the reference frame's X-axis. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value Specifies the Y-coordinate, in pixel or world units. M_POSITION_X Sets the X-coordinate of the center of a constructed circle or arc, or sets the X-coordinate of a constructed local frame or point. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value Specifies the X-coordinate, in pixel or world units. M_POSITION_Y Sets the Y-coordinate of the center of a constructed circle or arc, or sets the Y-coordinate of a constructed local frame or point. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value Specifies the Y-coordinate, in pixel or world units. M_RADIUS Sets the radius of a constructed circle or arc. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the radius, in pixel or world units. M_REFERENCE_FRAME Sets the feature's reference frame. M_DEFAULT Specifies that the reference frame is the global frame. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the label of the reference frame. M_SORT Sets the sorting order that MIL applies to the index of subpoints, when retrieving results of multiple point features. A multiple point feature is a point feature that contains more than one point. By default, the subpoints (points within the point feature) are sorted in ascending order, from the subpoint with the lowest index to the subpoint with the highest index. M_DEFAULT Same as M_SORT_UP. M_SORT_DOWN Specifies that results of multiple point features are sorted in descending order, according to the subpoint's index. M_SORT_UP Specifies that results of multiple point features are sorted in ascending order, according to the subpoint's index. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to control constructed edgel features. In this case, the LabelOrIndex parameter must be set to the label or index of the feature, using M_FEATURE_LABEL() or M_FEATURE_INDEX(), and the MetId parameter must be set to a metrology context. For controlling constructed edgel features ControlType Description ControlValue M_EDGEL_PROVIDED_ORDER Sets whether the egdels/points used to construct the edgel feature are listed in a meaningful order. This setting applies to edgel features that are constructed using externally established edgels/points (MmetAddFeature() with M_EXTERNAL_FEATURE), which can come from other MIL modules or third party software. Such edgels/points are specified using one or more arrays in MmetPut(). The order in which the edgels/points are specified in the arrays is considered meaningfully when, for example, they are listed according to their orientation (such as when they come from a laser line profile) or according to a coherent path (such as when they follow each other in a circular shape). Specifying ordered edgels/points can be useful when, for example, denoising or resampling edgels. M_DEFAULT Same as M_NONE. M_NONE Specifies unordered edgels/points. M_SEQUENTIAL Specifies ordered edgels/points. In this case, MIL maintains the order in which the edgels/points were specified using MmetPut(). M_EDGEL_RESAMPLING_LINE_ANGLE Sets the angle of a line along which to resample edgels. For example, you can resample along a laser line. This setting only has an effect if M_EDGEL_RESAMPLING_MODE is set to a value other than its default (which is M_NULL). This setting applies to constructed edgel features that are built by copying the edgels of the specified base features (MmetAddFeature() with M_COPY_FEATURE_EDGELS). M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies to disable resampling along a line. In this case, the resampling that MIL performs (and subsequent operations) can be slower, as more internal computations are required. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the angle of the line along which to resample edgels. The angle is relative to the reference frame's X-axis and follows the counter-clockwise convention. If you specify an angle of 0.0, MIL resamples the edgels along a line at that angle. If you want MIL to resample without using a line, set M_EDGEL_RESAMPLING_LINE_ANGLE to M_DISABLE. M_EDGEL_RESAMPLING_MODE Sets how to resample edgels. Resampling refers to using internal estimation techniques (mean or median) to modify and improve the edgels that MIL uses. This setting applies to constructed edgel features that are built by copying the edgels of the specified base features (MmetAddFeature() with M_COPY_FEATURE_EDGELS). M_DEFAULT Same as M_NULL. M_NULL Specifies no resampling. M_MEAN Specifies a mean type of resampling. M_MEDIAN Specifies a median type of resampling. M_EDGEL_RESAMPLING_RADIUS Sets the radius by which to resample edgels. This setting only has an effect if M_EDGEL_RESAMPLING_MODE is set to a value other than its default (which is M_NULL). This setting applies to constructed edgel features that are built by copying the edgels of the specified base features (MmetAddFeature() with M_COPY_FEATURE_EDGELS). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 10.0. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the radius. M_EDGEL_RESAMPLING_USE_ORDER Sets whether MIL should use and maintain the order of the edgels when resampling them. This setting only has an effect if M_EDGEL_RESAMPLING_MODE is set to a value other than its default (which is M_NULL). This setting applies to constructed edgel features that are built by copying the edgels of the specified base features (MmetAddFeature() with M_COPY_FEATURE_EDGELS). M_DISABLE Specifies that MIL should not use and maintain the order of the edgels then resampling them. M_ENABLE Specifies that MIL should use and maintain the order of the edgels when resampling them. This can improve the speed and accuracy of the resampling. This also ensures that the resampling itself does not reorder the edgels; keeping the original order can be useful for future operations. This is the default value. M_GROUP_EDGEL_GAP_SIZE Sets the maximum allowable gap (distance) between edgels for MIL to consider them part of the same group. This setting applies to constructed edgel features built by calling MmetAddFeature() with M_GROUP_EDGELS. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_AUTO Specifies that MIL should automatically determine the gap size. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the gap size, in pixels. M_GROUP_MIN_NUMBER_OF_EDGELS Sets the minimum number of edgels a group must have. MIL removes all groups that do not meet this minimum number. This setting applies to constructed edgel features built by calling MmetAddFeature() with M_GROUP_EDGELS. M_DEFAULT Same as M_NONE. M_NONE Specifies that there is no minimum number of edgels that a group must have. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the minimum number of edgels that a group must have. M_GROUP_SELECTION_MODE Sets how to group edgels. This setting applies to constructed edgel features built by calling MmetAddFeature() with M_GROUP_EDGELS. MIL initially establishes the groups based on the gaps (distance) between the edgels. By default, MIL automatically determines the gap size to group edgels. Edgels that are closer to each other than the gap size are considered part of the same group. To explicitly specify the gap size, use M_GROUP_EDGEL_GAP_SIZE. MIL then eliminates any potential group, if it does not have the minimum number of edgels, which you can set with M_GROUP_MIN_NUMBER_OF_EDGELS (by default, there is no minimum requirement). Once these basic groups are formed, you can either select one group or all groups using M_GROUP_SELECTION_MODE. M_DEFAULT Same as M_OCCURRENCE. M_CLOSEST_TO_POINT Specifies to select one group, based on its proximity to a point or the local frame's origin. By default, MIL selects the group (from the initially established groups) that is closest to the global frame's origin. To select the group that is closest to a different point, use M_GROUP_SELECTION_POINT. M_OCCURRENCE Specifies to select one or all group(s), based on the index of the group of edgels. By default, MIL selects all of the initially established groups. The group index is determined at runtime when creating the groups. To select only one group based on its index, use M_GROUP_SELECTION_OCCURRENCE. M_GROUP_SELECTION_OCCURRENCE Sets whether to select one group of edgels or all groups of edgels. This setting applies to constructed edgel features built by calling MmetAddFeature() with M_GROUP_EDGELS. This setting only has an effect if M_GROUP_SELECTION_MODE is set to M_OCCURRENCE. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ALL. M_ALL Specifies to use all groups of edgels. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the index of the group of edgels to select. The index number of the groups is determined at runtime. M_GROUP_SELECTION_POINT Sets the point or local frame feature from which to select the group of edgels. This setting applies to constructed edgel features built by calling MmetAddFeature() with M_GROUP_EDGELS. This setting only has an effect if M_GROUP_SELECTION_MODE is set to M_CLOSEST_TO_POINT. M_DEFAULT Same as M_GLOBAL_FRAME. M_GLOBAL_FRAME Specifies a virtual point at the location (origin) of the global frame. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the label of an existing point feature or local frame feature. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to set the geometry of the derived metrology region. In this case, the LabelOrIndex parameter must be set to M_DERIVED_GEOMETRY_REGION and the MetId parameter must be set to a derived metrology region object. You must also call MmetSetRegion() with M_FROM_DERIVED_GEOMETRY_REGION and specify the label or index of the measured feature that will be established from the area delimited by the derived metrology region. For setting the geometry of the derived metrology region ControlType Description ControlValue M_REGION_GEOMETRY Sets the geometry of the derived metrology region. Each M_REGION_GEOMETRY setting states the required set of M_REGION_... controls that fully define the derived metrology region and its orientation. M_DEFAULT Same as M_INFINITE. M_ARC Specifies that the feature will be established with an arc metrology region. You can use M_ARC to establish point features. To define an arc metrology region, you must set its end angle (M_REGION_ANGLE_END), start angle (M_REGION_ANGLE_START), position (M_REGION_POSITION or M_REGION_POSITION_X and M_REGION_POSITION_Y), and radius (M_REGION_RADIUS). M_INFINITE Specifies that the feature will be established with an infinite metrology region. An infinite metrology region is an X- Y-plane, which makes it similar to a rectangle metrology region. However, a rectangle is bounded by its width and height, while an infinite metrology region has no such boundary. You can use M_INFINITE to establish any feature. To define an infinite metrology region, you must set its angle (M_REGION_ANGLE) and position (M_REGION_POSITION or M_REGION_POSITION_X and M_REGION_POSITION_Y). The orientation of an infinite metrology region is established by its angle. M_RECTANGLE Specifies that the feature will be established with a rectangle metrology region. You can use M_RECTANGLE to establish segment or edgel features. To define a rectangle metrology region, you must set its angle (M_REGION_ANGLE), height (M_REGION_HEIGHT), position (M_REGION_POSITION or M_REGION_POSITION_X and M_REGION_POSITION_Y), and width (M_REGION_WIDTH). M_RING Specifies that the feature will be established with a ring metrology region. You can use M_RING to establish circle or edgel features. To define a ring metrology region, you must set its position (M_REGION_POSITION or M_REGION_POSITION_X and M_REGION_POSITION_Y), end radius (M_REGION_RADIUS_END), and start radius (M_REGION_RADIUS_START). M_RING_SECTOR Specifies that the feature will be established with a ring-sector metrology region. You can use M_RING_SECTOR to establish radial segment, arc, or edgel features. To define a ring-sector metrology region, you must set its end angle (M_REGION_ANGLE_END), start angle (M_REGION_ANGLE_START), position (M_REGION_POSITION or M_REGION_POSITION_X and M_REGION_POSITION_Y), end radius (M_REGION_RADIUS_END) and start radius (M_REGION_RADIUS_START). M_SEGMENT Specifies that the feature will be established with a linear segment metrology region. You can use M_SEGMENT to establish point features. To define a linear segment metrology region, you must set its end point (M_REGION_END or M_REGION_END_X and M_REGION_END_Y), and start point (M_REGION_START or M_REGION_START_X and M_REGION_START_Y). The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to set the geometry data required to define a derived metrology region. In this case, the LabelOrIndex parameter must be set to M_DERIVED_GEOMETRY_REGION and the MetId parameter must be set to a derived metrology region object. The controls in the following table that you must set depend on the geometry specified with M_REGION_GEOMETRY. For setting the geometry data of the derived metrology region ControlType Description ControlValue M_REGION_ANGLE Sets the angle of the derived metrology region, relative to the reference frame. M_REGION_ANGLE applies to M_INFINITE and M_RECTANGLE derived metrology regions, unless otherwise specified. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0°. M_RADIAL Specifies that the infinite metrology region has a radial orientation, from 0.0° to 360.0°, based on the specified position (M_REGION_POSITION). M_RADIAL applies to M_INFINITE only. In such a region, edgels can only be considered part of the physically measured feature if their gradient angle conforms to the direction of a radii pointing out from the region's position. M_RADIAL is usually used to define a metrology region for a physically measured circular feature whose radius is unknown. Typically the position of this metrology region is placed at the feature's center, resulting in valid edgels only being possible if they encircle the position. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 360.0 Specifies the angle, in degrees. In this case, you must set M_REGION_ANGLE_TYPE to M_PARAMETRIC. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the label of a point feature, which metrology uses to set the angle of the derived metrology region. In this case, you must set M_REGION_ANGLE_TYPE to M_FEATURE_LABEL_VALUE. When specifying the label of a point, MIL considers the angle to be between the X-axis along the metrology region's position (for example, M_REGION_POSITION), and a theoretical straight line that connects that position to the specified point feature. By default, the X-axis along the metrology region's position is aligned along the X-axis of the reference frame. The following example shows how a specified point establishes the angle of a rectangle metrology region. M_REGION_ANGLE_END Sets the end angle of the derived metrology region, relative to the reference frame. M_REGION_ANGLE_END applies to M_ARC or M_RING_SECTOR derived metrology regions. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 360.0°. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 360.0 Specifies the angle, in degrees. In this case, you must set M_REGION_ANGLE_END_TYPE to M_PARAMETRIC. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the label of a point feature, which metrology uses to set the end angle of the metrology region. In this case, you must set M_REGION_ANGLE_END_TYPE to M_FEATURE_LABEL_VALUE. When specifying the label of a point, MIL considers the end angle to be between the X-axis along the metrology region's position (for example, M_REGION_POSITION), and a theoretical straight line that connects that position to the specified point feature. By default, the X-axis along the metrology region's position is aligned along the X-axis of the reference frame. The following example shows how a specified point establishes the end angle of an arc metrology region. The example also shows how a specified point establishes the start angle of an arc metrology region (M_REGION_ANGLE_START). M_REGION_ANGLE_END_TYPE Sets whether you are using a feature or an explicit value to specify the end angle of the derived metrology region (M_REGION_ANGLE_END). M_DEFAULT Same as M_PARAMETRIC. M_FEATURE_LABEL_VALUE Specifies to use a feature. M_PARAMETRIC Specifies to use an explicit value. M_REGION_ANGLE_START Sets the start angle of the derived metrology region, relative to the reference frame. M_REGION_ANGLE_START applies to M_ARC or M_RING_SECTOR derived metrology regions. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0°. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 360.0 Specifies the angle, in degrees. In this case, you must set M_REGION_ANGLE_START_TYPE to M_PARAMETRIC. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the label of a point feature, which metrology uses to set the start angle of the metrology region. In this case, you must set M_REGION_ANGLE_START_TYPE to M_FEATURE_LABEL_VALUE. When specifying the label of a point, MIL considers the start angle to be between the X-axis along the metrology region's position (for example, M_REGION_POSITION), and a theoretical straight line that connects that position to the specified point feature. By default, the X-axis along the metrology region's position is aligned along the X-axis of the reference frame. The following example shows how a specified point establishes the start angle of an arc metrology region. The example also shows how a specified point establishes the end angle of an arc metrology region (M_REGION_ANGLE_END). M_REGION_ANGLE_START_TYPE Sets whether you are using a feature or an explicit value to specify the start angle of the derived metrology region (M_REGION_ANGLE_START). M_DEFAULT Same as M_PARAMETRIC. M_FEATURE_LABEL_VALUE Specifies to use a feature. M_PARAMETRIC Specifies to use an explicit value.

Value &gt; 0 Specifies the label of a point feature, which metrology uses to set the rectangle's height. In this case, you must set M_REGION_HEIGHT_TYPE to M_FEATURE_LABEL_VALUE. When specifying the label of a point, MIL considers the height to be at the perpendicular intersection point between the Y-axis along the metrology region's position (for example, M_REGION_POSITION), and the X-axis along the specified point feature. By default, the X- and Y-axes along the metrology region's position and along the specified point are aligned with the reference frame.

Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the radius, in pixel or world units. In this case, you must set M_REGION_RADIUS_TYPE to M_PARAMETRIC. M_REGION_RADIUS_END Sets the end radius of the derived metrology region. M_REGION_RADIUS_END applies to M_RING or M_RING_SECTOR derived metrology regions. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0 pixels. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the label of a point feature, which metrology uses to set the end radius. In this case, you must set M_REGION_RADIUS_END_TYPE to M_FEATURE_LABEL_VALUE. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the end radius, in pixel or world units. In this case, you must set M_REGION_RADIUS_END_TYPE to M_PARAMETRIC. M_REGION_RADIUS_END_TYPE Sets whether you are using a feature or an explicit value to specify the end radius of the derived metrology region (M_REGION_RADIUS_END). M_DEFAULT Same as M_PARAMETRIC.

Value &gt; 0 Specifies the label of a point feature, which metrology uses to set the start point of the metrology region. M_REGION_START_TYPE Sets whether you are using a feature or an explicit value to specify the start point of the derived metrology region (M_REGION_START or M_REGION_START_X and M_REGION_START_Y).

Value &gt; 0 Specifies the label of a point feature, which metrology uses to set the rectangle's width. In this case, you must set M_REGION_WIDTH_TYPE to M_FEATURE_LABEL_VALUE. When specifying the label of a point, MIL considers the width to be at the perpendicular intersection point between the X-axis along the metrology region's position (for example, M_REGION_POSITION), and the Y-axis along the specified point feature. By default, the X- and Y-axes along the metrology region's position and along the specified point are aligned with the reference frame. The example also shows how a specified point establishes the height of a rectangle metrology region (M_REGION_HEIGHT). Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the rectangle's width, in pixel or world units. In this case, you must set M_REGION_WIDTH_TYPE to M_PARAMETRIC.

M_FEATURE_LABEL_VALUE Specifies to use a feature. M_PARAMETRIC Specifies to use an explicit value. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to control the geometric tolerances calculated for a metrology context. For controlling geometric tolerances, the LabelOrIndex parameter can be set to M_ALL_TOLERANCES or an existing tolerance label or index using M_TOLERANCE_LABEL() or M_TOLERANCE_INDEX(). The MetId parameter must be set to a metrology context. Unless otherwise specified, the following settings apply to any geometric tolerance (MmetAddTolerance()). For controlling geometric tolerances ControlType Description ControlValue M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES_DEFINE_SIDE Sets the reference frame that determines the side of the curve on which to validate the area, when you specify an M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES tolerance, and enable the M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES_ONE_SIDE_ONLY setting. M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES_DEFINE_SIDE is typically used if the two specified curves (edgel features) that the M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES tolerance validates cross over each other, causing areas on both sides of the curves. In this case, when enabling M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES_ONE_SIDE_ONLY, MIL must establish the side on which the area is considered positive, and must add the areas on that side only. Areas on the other side (which is considered the negative side) are ignored. The positive and negative sides are determined by whether the Y-axis of the reference frame (by default, the global frame) initially intersects with either the first or second curve that is specified with the M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES tolerance. If the Y-axis initially intersects with the first specified curve, all the areas on the side of the first curve facing the direction of the Y-axis are considered positive and MIL adds them; all the areas on the other side of the first curve are considered negative and MIL ignores them. If the Y-axis initially intersects with the second specified curve, all the areas on the side of the second curve facing the direction of the Y-axis are considered negative and MIL ignores them; all the areas on the other side of the second curve are considered positive and MIL adds them. If neither curve intersects the Y-axis, or if only one curve intersects the Y-axis, the sign of the areas between the curves is computed based on the order in which the two curves are defined. If the points delimiting an area on the first specified curve appear in a clockwise order, then this area will be negative. If they appear in a counter-clockwise order, then this area will be positive. Note that both the reference frame, and the order in which you specify the two curves with M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES, determine the side on which to validate the tolerance. M_DEFAULT Same as M_GLOBAL_FRAME. M_FEATURE_INDEX( MIL_INT LocalFrameIndex ) Specifies the label value of a local frame feature. Parameters LocalFrameIndex Specifies the local frame index, as a value greater than or equal to 0. The index value 0 refers to the global frame. M_FEATURE_LABEL( MIL_INT LocalFrameLabel ) Specifies the label value of a local frame feature. Parameters LocalFrameLabel Specifies the local frame label, as a value greater than 0. M_GLOBAL_FRAME Specifies the global frame. M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES_ONE_SIDE_ONLY Sets whether to validate the area on only one side of the curve, when you specify an M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES tolerance. M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES_ONE_SIDE_ONLY is typically used if the two specified curves (edgel features) that the M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES tolerance validates cross over each other, causing areas on both sides of the curves. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that MIL does not validate the area on only one side of the curve. Areas on both sides are either all added, or added and subtracted, depending on whether M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES_OPPOSITES_SUBTRACT is enabled or disabled. M_ENABLE Specifies that MIL validates the area on only one side of the curve. To enable M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES_ONE_SIDE_ONLY, you must disable M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES_OPPOSITES_SUBTRACT (it is disabled by default). When enabling M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES_ONE_SIDE_ONLY, MIL must establish the side on which the area is considered positive, and must add the areas on that side only. Areas on the other side (which is considered the negative side) are ignored. By default, the positive and negative sides are determined by whether the global reference frame's Y-axis initially intersects with either the first or second curve that is specified with the M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES tolerance. To determine the positive and negative sides by using a reference frame other than the global frame, use M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES_DEFINE_SIDE. For more information about this behavior, see M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES_DEFINE_SIDE. M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES_OPPOSITES_SUBTRACT Sets whether MIL should subtract opposing areas, when you specify an M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES tolerance. M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES_OPPOSITES_SUBTRACT only has an effect if the two specified curves (edgel features) that the M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES tolerance validates cross over each other, causing areas on both sides of the curves. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that MIL does not subtract opposing areas. All areas between the curves are added. By default, MIL adds the areas on both sides of the curves. To add the areas on only one side, enable M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES_ONE_SIDE_ONLY. M_ENABLE Specifies that MIL subtracts the areas on one side of the curve (opposing areas) from the areas on the other side of the curve, so that the result is positive. The side with the smaller total area is always subtracted from the side with the greater total area. To enable M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES_OPPOSITES_SUBTRACT, you must disable M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES_ONE_SIDE_ONLY (it is disabled by default). M_AREA_UNDER_CURVE_ALLOW_NEGATIVE Sets whether MIL allows negative (opposing) areas when establishing the area tolerance for M_AREA_UNDER_CURVE_MAX or M_AREA_UNDER_CURVE_MIN. Negative areas occur when the specified curve (edgel) feature that the tolerance is validating crosses over the specified line feature. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that MIL does not allow negative areas when establishing the area tolerance. If there are negative areas, the tolerance fails. M_ENABLE Specifies that MIL allows negative areas when establishing the area tolerance. In this case, MIL subtracts the negative areas from the larger, positive areas when establishing the area tolerance. The negative areas are those located on the side of the line where the sum of the areas is the smallest. M_CURVE_EDGEL_GAP_SIZE Sets the maximum gap between edgels for MIL to consider them part of the same curve of edgels, when you specify an M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES, M_AREA_UNDER_CURVE_MAX, or M_AREA_UNDER_CURVE_MIN tolerance. If the gap between edgels is greater than the maximum gap, those edgels will not be part of the same curve. M_DEFAULT Same as M_PIXEL_SIZE_DIAGONAL. M_PIXEL_SIZE_DIAGONAL Specifies twice the diagonal size of the pixels from which the edgels were taken. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the size, in pixels. M_CURVE_INFO Sets the information that MIL uses to establish the curves of edgels, when you specify an M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES tolerance. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO_CURVE_OPENED. M_FEATURE_INDEX( MIL_INT LocalFrameIndex ) Specifies the index of a reference frame feature (local frame). The reference frame indicates the direction of the curves, and is used to sort the edgels accordingly. That is, M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES assumes the direction of the curves' edgels is relative to the reference frame's X-axis. Specifying a direction can make the tolerance faster to calculate, and less sensitive to gaps between edgels. When you set M_CURVE_INFO to a reference frame, M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES assumes that the curves are unbounded (open), as edgel direction does not apply to bounded (closed) curves. Parameters LocalFrameIndex Specifies the index value of an existing reference frame (local frame). The index value 0 refers to the global frame. M_FEATURE_LABEL( MIL_INT LocalFrameLabel ) Specifies the label of a reference frame feature (local frame). The reference frame indicates the direction of the curves, and is used to sort the edgels accordingly. That is, M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES assumes the direction of the curves' edgels is relative to the reference frame's X-axis. Specifying a direction can make the tolerance faster to calculate, and less sensitive to gaps between edgels. When you set M_CURVE_INFO to a reference frame, M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES assumes that the curves are unbounded (open), as edgel direction does not apply to bounded (closed) curves. Parameters LocalFrameLabel Specifies the label value of an existing reference frame (local frame). M_AUTO_CURVE_CLOSED Specifies that the M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES tolerance is validating bounded (closed) curves (edgel features). This setting is typically used when you want to validate closed curves that pass through all the edgels. Such curves should not cross over themselves and must form only one closed shape (for example, the curve cannot form a figure 8, which can be seen as two circular shapes). With this setting, the tolerance does not assume that the curves follow a specific direction (since the shape is closed, direction does not apply). Such curves should have edgels with very minimal gaps between them. If the curves (edgel features) that you specified were externally established with sequential edgels (M_EDGEL_PROVIDED_ORDER set to M_SEQUENTIAL), MIL maintains the order of the edgels, which can make calculations faster and more accurate (provided that the specified edgel order forms a properly closed curve). M_AUTO_CURVE_OPENED Specifies that the M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES tolerance is validating unbounded (opened) curves (edgel features). This setting is typically used when you want to validate opened curves that pass through all the edgels. Such curves should not cross over themselves and must form one fully opened shape (for example, the curve cannot form the number 6, which can be seen as touching and partially closed). With this setting, the tolerance does not assume that the curves follow a specific direction. Such curves should have edgels with very minimal gaps between them. To make the tolerance less sensitive to gaps (and potentially faster to calculate), specify a direction for the curve, by setting M_CURVE_INFO to a reference frame. If the curves (edgel features) that you specified were externally established with sequential edgels (M_EDGEL_PROVIDED_ORDER set to M_SEQUENTIAL), MIL maintains the order of the edgels, which can make calculations faster and more accurate (provided that the specified edgel order forms a properly opened curve). M_DISTANCE_MODE Sets how to apply the angle at which to establish the distance between features when adding a distance tolerance. This affects MmetAddTolerance() with M_DISTANCE_MAX or M_DISTANCE_MIN. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ABSOLUTE. M_ABSOLUTE Specifies that MIL establishes the angle by taking the distance at which the features are either the farthest (for M_DISTANCE_MAX) or the closest (for M_DISTANCE_MIN). M_FERET_AT_ANGLE Specifies that MIL calculates the distance tolerance using the feret at the angle that is set (M_ANGLE). This only applies to M_DISTANCE_MAX. MIL measures the angle (M_ANGLE) relative to the coordinate system of the first base feature with which to validate the maximum distance tolerance. M_GAP_AT_ANGLE Specifies that MIL calculates the distance tolerance using the gap at the angle that is set (M_ANGLE). This only applies to M_DISTANCE_MIN. MIL measures the angle (M_ANGLE) relative to the first base feature with which to validate the minimum distance tolerance. M_GAIN Sets the gain MIL uses to correct systematic bias between multiple imaging vision set-ups. Systematic bias can, for example, exist between two different Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs). Note that tolerance values, which MIL uses to determine the status of features (and the status of tolerances themselves), are a composite of measured value, gain (M_GAIN), and offset (M_OFFSET). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value Specifies the gain. M_OFFSET Sets the offset MIL uses to correct systematic bias between multiple imaging vision set-ups. Systematic bias can, for example, exist between two different Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs). Note that tolerance values, which MIL uses to determine the status of features (and the status of tolerances themselves), are a composite of measured value, offset (M_OFFSET), and gain (M_GAIN). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value Specifies the offset. M_VALUE_MAX Sets the maximum acceptable value for the geometric tolerance MIL uses to validate the feature or the relationship between multiple features. For example, if you use a length tolerance to validate the linear dimension of a segment feature, and you set M_VALUE_MAX to 100 pixels, the feature (and the tolerance itself) can only be valid if the segment's length is less than 100 pixels. Similarly, if you are using a perpendicularity tolerance to validate the relationship between two segment features, and you set M_VALUE_MAX to 0.05°, the features (and the tolerance itself) can only be valid if the angle between the segments is between 90.0° and 90.05°. To get the status (M_PASS, M_WARNING, or M_FAIL) of the feature or the geometric tolerance itself, use MmetGetResult() with M_STATUS. Features can only have a passing status if their geometric tolerance has a passing status. MIL determines the status of geometric tolerances according to the M_VALUE_MAX, M_VALUE_MIN, M_VALUE_WARNING_MAX, and M_VALUE_WARNING_MIN settings. The following is an example of (non-zero) minimum and maximum tolerance values and warning values: M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value Specifies the maximum value. M_VALUE_MIN Sets the minimum value for a geometric tolerance to have a valid status. To get the status of the geometric tolerance (M_PASS, M_WARNING, or M_FAIL), use MmetGetResult() with M_STATUS. The geometric tolerance's status is determined according to the M_VALUE_MAX, M_VALUE_MIN, M_VALUE_WARNING_MAX, and M_VALUE_WARNING_MIN settings. For an example of (non-zero) minimum and maximum tolerance values and warning values, see M_VALUE_MAX. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value Specifies the minimum value. M_VALUE_WARNING_MAX Sets the maximum warning value for a geometric tolerance to have a valid status. To get the status of the geometric tolerance (M_PASS, M_WARNING, or M_FAIL), use MmetGetResult() with M_STATUS. The geometric tolerance's status is determined according to the M_VALUE_MAX, M_VALUE_MIN, M_VALUE_WARNING_MAX, and M_VALUE_WARNING_MIN settings. For an example of (non-zero) minimum and maximum tolerance values and warning values, see M_VALUE_MAX. M_DEFAULT Same as M_EQUAL_PASS_MAX. M_EQUAL_PASS_MAX Specifies that the maximum warning value is equal to the maximum pass value (M_VALUE_MAX). Value Specifies the maximum warning value. M_VALUE_WARNING_MIN Sets the minimum warning value for a geometric tolerance to have a valid status. To get the status of the geometric tolerance (M_PASS, M_WARNING, or M_FAIL), use MmetGetResult() with M_STATUS. The geometric tolerance's status is determined according to the M_VALUE_MAX, M_VALUE_MIN, M_VALUE_WARNING_MAX, and M_VALUE_WARNING_MIN settings. For an example of (non-zero) minimum and maximum tolerance values and warning values, see M_VALUE_MAX. M_DEFAULT Same as M_EQUAL_PASS_MIN. M_EQUAL_PASS_MIN Specifies that the minimum warning value is equal to the minimum pass value (M_VALUE_MIN). Value Specifies the minimum warning value. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to control features and geometric tolerances of a metrology context. For controlling features, the LabelOrIndex parameter can be set to M_GLOBAL_FRAME or one or all features. For controlling geometric tolerances, the LabelOrIndex parameter can be set to one or all tolerances. The MetId parameter must be set to a metrology context. For controlling features or geometric tolerances ControlType Description ControlValue M_ANGLE Sets the angle used to construct a feature or define a tolerance, when applicable. For more information, refer to the feature or tolerance with which you are using the angle setting (for example, MmetAddFeature() with M_ANGLE / M_ANGLE_ABSOLUTE / M_ANGLE_RELATIVE / M_SECTOR_RELATIVE / M_PARAMETRIC, or MmetAddTolerance() with M_ANGULARITY). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0°. Value Specifies the angle. Depending on the build operation, you must set the angle in either degrees, or as a percentage. M_DRAWABLE Sets whether the feature or tolerance will be drawn using MmetDraw(). M_DEFAULT Same as M_ENABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that the feature or tolerance will not be drawn. In this case, you cannot affect them in an interactive display. M_ENABLE Specifies that the feature or tolerance will be drawn. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to transform clone-type features (MmetAddFeature() with M_CLONE_FEATURE). For example, M_CLONE_SCALE can specify that the cloned feature will be twice the size of its source. To specify clone transformations, set the LabelOrIndex parameter to the label or index of an existing clone-type feature, using M_FEATURE_LABEL() or M_FEATURE_INDEX(). This is the cloned feature to which the transformation (M_CLONE_...) will apply. The MetId parameter must be set to a metrology context. For controlling clone transformations ControlType Description ControlValue M_CLONE_ANGLE Sets the rotation angle, in the counterclockwise direction, that is applied to the cloned feature (LabelOrIndex). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0°. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 360.0 Specifies the angle, in degrees. M_CLONE_OFFSET_X Sets the translation value, in the X-direction, that is applied to the cloned feature (LabelOrIndex). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0 pixels. Value Specifies the X-offset for the cloned feature, in pixel or world units. M_CLONE_OFFSET_Y Sets the translation value, in the Y-direction, that is applied to the cloned feature (LabelOrIndex). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0 pixels. Value Specifies the Y-offset for the cloned feature, in pixel or world units. M_CLONE_SCALE Sets the scale factor that is applied to the cloned feature (LabelOrIndex). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1.0. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the scale factor. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to control the results calculated and stored in a metrology result buffer. For controlling results, the LabelOrIndex parameter must be set to M_GENERAL. The MetId parameter must be set to a metrology result buffer. For controlling results ControlType Description ControlValue M_OUTPUT_FRAME Sets the output reference frame that MIL uses to return feature results. All results are returned relative to the output reference frame that you set. The output reference frame is reset to M_GLOBAL_FRAME after each call to MmetCalculate(). M_DEFAULT Same as M_GLOBAL_FRAME. M_GLOBAL_FRAME Specifies that MIL returns feature results relative to the origin of the global frame. If the target image is not calibrated, the global frame's default origin (0,0) is aligned with the center of the top-left corner pixel of the target image. If the target image is calibrated, the global frame's default origin is aligned with the origin of the relative (world) coordinate system. M_IMAGE_FRAME Specifies that MIL returns feature results relative to the origin of the target image's reference frame. If the target image is not calibrated, the origin of the target image's reference frame is at the center of the top-left corner pixel of the target image. If the target image is calibrated, the origin of the target image reference frame is the same as the relative coordinate system of the camera calibration. M_REFERENCE_FRAME Specifies that MIL returns feature results relative to the reference frame of each feature. By default, a feature's reference frame is the global frame. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the label of an existing local frame feature to use to return feature results. M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS Sets whether to return results in pixels or world units. This essentially sets the output coordinate system to use. The setting of this control type will only affect functions within this module which return positional results. This control type can be changed at any time to return results in the required output units. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ACCORDING_TO_CALIBRATION. M_ACCORDING_TO_CALIBRATION Specifies that results are returned in world units if the result was calculated on an image associated with a camera calibration context; otherwise, specifies that results are returned in pixel units. M_PIXEL Specifies that results are returned in pixel units, with respect to the pixel coordinate system. M_WORLD Specifies that results are returned in world units, with respect to the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, calling MmetGetResult() generates an error if the result was not calculated on a calibrated image. The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings are used to delete features and tolerances from the context. The LabelOrIndex parameter can be set to one of the following: M_ALL_FEATURES, M_ALL_TOLERANCES, an existing feature label or index using M_FEATURE_LABEL() or M_FEATURE_INDEX(), or an existing tolerance label or index using M_TOLERANCE_LABEL() or M_TOLERANCE_INDEX(). The MetId parameter must be set to a metrology context. For deleting features and tolerances ControlType Description ControlValue M_DELETE Deletes a specific feature, a specific tolerance, all features, or all tolerances. To delete all features, the LabelOrIndex parameter needs to be set to M_ALL_FEATURES. When deleting a feature, all its derived features and associated geometric tolerances are also deleted. To delete all tolerances, the LabelOrIndex parameter needs to be set to M_ALL_TOLERANCES. M_DEFAULT Same as M_NULL. M_NULL Deletes a specific feature, a specific tolerance, all features, or all tolerances.

      "text": " MmetDraw Synopsis Draw specific features or tolerances of a metrology context or of a metrology result. Syntax void MmetDraw( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextGraId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextOrResultMetId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstImageBufOrListGraId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Operation, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;LabelOrIndex, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function draws specific features or tolerances of a metrology context or of a metrology result, in the destination image buffer or 2D graphics list. If you pass a context, MmetDraw() can only draw the specified feature/tolerance if the function can internally compute it without the need of a source image. This is possible if the feature/tolerance is ultimately based on constructed edgel features built with external edgels/points (MmetAddFeature() with M_EDGEL and M_EXTERNAL_FEATURE) and the external edgels/points have been specified using MmetPut(), and/or if it is ultimately based on parametric features. Note that MmetDraw() does not modify the context with internally calculated results. You can draw results and settings, obtained relative to an offset, at the top-left corner of the destination image, using MgraControl() with M_DRAW_OFFSET_X and M_DRAW_OFFSET_Y and zoom them using MgraControl() with M_DRAW_ZOOM_X and M_DRAW_ZOOM_Y. For more information, see the Drawing graphics with offset and zoom subsection of the Drawing graphics section of Chapter 26: Generating graphics. When zooming, MmetDraw() will draw into the destination image buffer even if the buffer is not large enough to contain all of the zoomed image. If necessary, the image will be clipped. If a template reference has been set using MmetControl() with M_TEMPLATE_REFERENCE_ID, MmetDraw() can draw the results of features and tolerances extracted from that template reference. You will need to inquire M_TEMPLATE_REFERENCE_SIZE_X and M_TEMPLATE_REFERENCE_SIZE_Y to allocate an appropriate destination buffer. Parameters Parameters ContextGraId Specifies the identifier of the 2D graphics context to use when drawing. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For specifying the 2D graphics context Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the default 2D graphics context of the current MIL application is used. Note that there is a different default 2D graphics context for each thread. MIL 2D graphics context identifier Specifies a valid 2D graphics context identifier, which you have allocated using MgraAlloc(). ContextOrResultMetId Specifies the metrology result buffer or context from which to extract the features to draw. The metrology result buffer must have been previously allocated using MmetAllocResult(). The metrology context must have been previously allocated using MmetAlloc(). If you are using MmetDraw() with a metrology context, you can specify that a feature or tolerance in the context should not be drawn, using MmetControl() with M_DRAWABLE set to M_DISABLE. This can be useful if you have many features or tolerances and you want to draw all of them in one call, although there are some that you do not want to see. When features or tolerances are not drawn, you cannot affect them in an interactive display. DstImageBufOrListGraId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer or 2D graphics list in which to draw. The buffer can be any valid MIL image buffer allocated using MbufAlloc...(). The 2D graphics list must be previously allocated using MgraAllocList(). By drawing into a display's overlay buffer or associating the 2D graphics list with the display, you can also annotate an image non-destructively. If specifying an image buffer, it must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. When using MmetDraw() to draw features with a source model that is associated with a calibration context and if a calibration context is associated with the destination buffer, the latter must also be calibrated to the same world coordinate system. If no calibration context is associated with the destination buffer, the latter will use the same one as the template reference's. To add a template reference to a metrology context, use MmetControl() with M_TEMPLATE_REFERENCE_ID. MmetDraw() draws all the requested features according to whether the destination image buffer is physically corrected or not. Operation Specifies the type of drawing operation to perform. This parameter can be set to the following values: For drawing a context characteristic Value Description M_DRAW_TEMPLATE_REFERENCE Draws the template reference. The LabelOrIndex parameter must be set to M_GENERAL. This operation cannot draw in a 2D graphics list. For the following constants, the LabelOrIndex parameter can be set to M_FEATURE_LABEL(), M_FEATURE_INDEX(), or M_ALL_FEATURES, unless otherwise specified. For drawing a feature characteristic Value Description M_DRAW_ACTIVE_EDGELS Draws only the edgels that satisfied all edgel constraints. M_DRAW_ALL_EDGELS Draws all the edgels that were calculated in the target image. This includes the edgels that were used to measure a feature. M_DRAW_FEATURE Draws the specified feature(s). In this case, you can also set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_GLOBAL_FRAME. M_DRAW_FITTED_EDGELS Draws only the edgels that satisfied all edgel constraints and fit constraints. The fitted edgels are those used by the fit operation to define a feature. M_DRAW_NOISY_EDGELS Draws the edgels before they were denoised. Edgels are denoised using MmetControl() with M_EDGEL_DENOISING_MODE. M_DRAW_REGION Draws the feature's search region. When drawing in a 2D graphics list, this operation cannot draw ring and ring sector regions when M_REGION_ACCURACY_HIGH is set to M_DISABLE and the 2D graphics context's input units is set to world units (MgraControl() with M_INPUT_UNITS set to M_WORLD). For the following constants, the LabelOrIndex parameter can be set to M_TOLERANCE_LABEL(), M_TOLERANCE_INDEX(), M_ALL_TOLERANCES, M_ALL_PASS_TOLERANCES, M_ALL_FAIL_TOLERANCES, or M_ALL_WARNING_TOLERANCES. For drawing a tolerance characteristic Value Description M_DRAW_TOLERANCE Draws the geometric tolerance's icon. To view the icons, see MmetAddTolerance(). M_DRAW_TOLERANCE_AREA Draws the area(s) used to define the area-based geometric tolerance. These tolerances are set using MmetAddTolerance() with M_AREA_.... M_DRAW_TOLERANCE_AREA_NEGATIVE Draws the negative area(s) used to define the area-based geometric tolerance. Positive and negative areas occur when areas exist on both sides of a curve. The negative areas are those located on the side of the curve where the sum of the areas is the smallest. These tolerances are set using MmetAddTolerance() with M_AREA_.... Note that what is considered the positive side changes if M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES_ONE_SIDE_ONLY is enabled. In this case, the positive and negative sides are determined by whether the global reference frame's Y-axis initially intersects with either the first or second curve (edgel feature) that is specified with the M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES tolerance. M_DRAW_TOLERANCE_AREA_POSITIVE Draws the positive area(s) used to define the area-based geometric tolerance. Positive and negative areas occur when areas exist on both sides of a curve. The positive areas are those located on the side of the curve where the sum of the areas is the largest. These tolerances are set using MmetAddTolerance() with M_AREA_.... Note that what is considered the positive side changes if M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES_ONE_SIDE_ONLY is enabled. In this case, the positive and negative sides are determined by whether the global reference frame's Y-axis initially intersects with either the first or second curve (edgel feature) that is specified with the M_AREA_BETWEEN_CURVES tolerance. M_DRAW_TOLERANCE_FEATURES Draws the features used to define a tolerance. The LabelOrIndex parameter can be set to M_TOLERANCE_LABEL(), M_TOLERANCE_INDEX(), M_ALL_TOLERANCES, M_ALL_PASS_TOLERANCES, M_ALL_FAIL_TOLERANCES, or M_ALL_WARNING_TOLERANCES. Combination values for M_DRAW_FEATURE , M_DRAW_TOLERANCE. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned values to specify that the label or name of the feature or tolerance will also be drawn. For M_DRAW_FEATURE and M_DRAW_TOLERANCE Combination value Description M_DRAW_LABEL Specifies that the label will also be drawn. M_DRAW_NAME Specifies that the name will also be drawn. LabelOrIndex Specifies the label or index of the result in the metrology result buffer for which to perform the drawing operation, or specifies that you are performing a general drawing operation for the metrology context. Set this parameter to one of the following values: For specifying the index of the element in the metrology result buffer Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default setting. M_DEFAULT is the same as M_ALL_FEATURES, when setting the Operation parameter to a value in the For drawing a feature characteristic table. M_DEFAULT is the same as M_ALL_TOLERANCES, when setting the Operation parameter to a value in the For drawing a tolerance characteristic table. M_DEFAULT is the same as M_GENERAL, when setting the Operation parameter to a value in the For drawing a context characteristic table.

Syntax void MmetGetResult( MIL_ID&nbsp;ResultId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;LabelOrIndex, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ResultType, //in void&nbsp;*ResultArrayPtr //out ) Description This function retrieves all results of the specified type from a metrology result buffer, after an MmetCalculate() call. The result entries are ordered by label value. If your target image was associated with a camera calibration context, positional and dimensional results are, by default, returned with respect to the relative coordinate system of the image. Otherwise, these results are returned in pixels, relative to the top-left pixel in the target image. If your target image was associated with a camera calibration context but you want to retrieve positional and dimensional results in pixel units, use MmetControl() with the M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS control type set to M_PIXEL. However, note that if you set M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS to M_WORLD without specifying a calibrated image in which to calculate the results, MmetGetResult() will generate an error. All results are returned relative to the output reference frame that you set using MmetControl() with M_OUTPUT_FRAME. Parameters Parameters ResultId Specifies the identifier of the metrology result buffer from which to get results. LabelOrIndex Specifies the feature or geometric tolerance for which to get results.

For retrieving results for features or tolerances ResultType Description ResultArrayPtr - Possible values returned M_LABEL_VALUE Retrieves the label of a specific feature or a specific tolerance. ResultArrayPtr extra info Data type info: Data type: address of a MIL_DOUBLE MORE Data type: address of a MIL_DOUBLE Recommended casting type: MIL_INT M_STATUS Retrieves the status of the calculation of features and tolerances. The feature's status is determined by whether MIL was able to successfully calculate it. Some features might be mathematically valid, but their unconventional design can prove problematic. For example, you can theoretically build a valid segment feature using two points at the same location; however, you could not create an extended intersection from such a segment. MIL considers such a feature to be in a degenerated state and returns its status as M_WARNING. Features that are impossible to construct will have an M_FAIL status; for example, you cannot build a line using two points at the same location (more information is needed to fulfill the requirement that a line extends indefinitely along a directional path). The geometric tolerance's status is determined by whether it (M_TOLERANCE_VALUE) adheres to the thresholds set using MmetControl() with M_VALUE_MAX, M_VALUE_MIN, M_VALUE_WARNING_MAX, and M_VALUE_WARNING_MIN. The following is an example of (non-zero) minimum and maximum tolerance value and warning value thresholds: To get a global status (the status of multiple statuses), set the LabelOrIndex parameter to M_GENERAL (to get the global status of all features and tolerances), M_ALL_FEATURES (to get the global status of all features), M_CONSTRUCTED_FEATURES (to get the global status of all constructed features), M_MEASURED_FEATURES (to get the global status of all measured features), or M_ALL_TOLERANCES (to get the global status of all tolerances). When retrieving a global status, M_STATUS only returns M_PASS when each individual status is M_PASS. If any individual status is M_FAIL, M_STATUS returns M_FAIL.

      "text": " MmetPut Synopsis Put edgels or points from user-supplied arrays into a constructed edgel feature built with external edgels/points. Syntax void MmetPut( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextMetId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;LabelOrIndex, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;NumEdgelsOrPoints, //in const MIL_INT&nbsp;*ChainIndexArrayPtr, //in const MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;*PosXArrayPtr, //in const MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;*PosYArrayPtr, //in const MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;*AngleArrayPtr, //in const MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;*ValueArrayPtr, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function adds edgels or points from user-supplied arrays to a constructed edgel feature built with external edgels/points. You can add a constructed edgel feature built with external edgels/points to the metrology context using MmetAddFeature() with M_EDGEL and M_EXTERNAL_FEATURE. Every time MmetPut() is called, it adds the specified edgels/points to the constructed feature, without overwriting previously-added edgels/points with the same position. Points and edgels can be added to the same feature, but you must use separate calls. MmetPut() is useful if you want to construct an edgel feature with edgels established using the Edge Finder module or with the coordinates of chained pixels (points) established using the Blob Analysis module. You can also, for example, use MmetPut() to add points from a cross-section of a 3D scanned object, delimited by an extraction box, so that you can analyze the profile of the cross-section. To inquire information about an external edgel feature (M_EXTERNAL_FEATURE), such as the total number of external points/edgels it contains (M_NUMBER), call MmetInquire(). Information about a particular edgel/point must occupy the same index in each array. You specify points by specifying their position (X- and Y-position arrays). You specify edgels by specifying their position and their gradient angle (edgel direction). An edgel's angle must respect the convention: The angle is measured between the target image's horizontal axis and the edge's gradient (the direction of the edgel's most sudden change from black to white). The angle is measured counter-clockwise. You must map the angle to an 8-bit range; that is, 0° corresponds to 0, and 360° corresponds to 256. A point/edgel's position must be relative to the reference frame of the constructed edgel feature (MmetControl() with M_REFERENCE_FRAME), which can be set to either the global frame or a local frame. When passing points that are along an edge, but you don't have their gradient angle information (as is the case when obtained using the Blob Analysis module), you can have MmetPut() automatically calculate their approximate gradient angle by passing M_INTERPOLATE_ANGLE to the ControlFlag parameter. MmetPut() interpolates their gradient angles assuming that points in the arrays are consecutive. As such, the points in the X- and Y-position arrays must be an ordered, connected chain of points. Note that if the points are not from an edge, you should not pass M_INTERPOLATE_ANGLE. Consecutive edgels in the arrays are considered to be consecutive in their associated edge. For edgels or points along an edge, you can associate the edgels/points with the index of their edge chain/pixel chain using the ChainIndexArrayPtr parameter. You can add to the end of an edge chain/pixel chain that has already been added to the feature. To remove all the edgels/points from the constructed edgel feature, set the ControlFlag parameter to M_RESET. Note, if a camera calibration context is associated with the expected target image, set values in real-world units (for example, positional values). Otherwise, use pixel units. Note that presented above is an example prototype of this function. You can call MmetPut() with the same prototype as any of the type-specific functions below, without using the function's type-specific name; that is, use MmetPut() and not, for example, MmetPutFloat(). MIL automatically casts the data into the appropriate type. This is true except when using a C compiler. When using a C compiler, you must always call this function with its type-specific name (you cannot use the standard name of this function). Parameters Parameters ContextMetId Specifies the identifier of the metrology context. The metrology context must have been previously allocated with MmetAlloc(). LabelOrIndex Specifies the label or index of a constructed edgel feature with an M_EXTERNAL_FEATURE build operation. For specifying the label or index value Value Description M_FEATURE_INDEX( MIL_INT FeatureIndex ) Specifies the index value of a constructed feature. Parameters FeatureIndex This parameter specifies the index of the constructed feature to which the edgels or points will be added. You can set this parameter to the following: Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the index of the constructed feature. Note that the index of the global frame is 0. M_FEATURE_LABEL( MIL_INT FeatureLabel ) Specifies the label value of a constructed feature. Parameters FeatureLabel This parameter specifies the label of the constructed feature to which the edgels or points will be added. You can set this parameter to the following: Value &gt; 0 Specifies the label of the constructed feature. NumEdgelsOrPoints Specifies the number of edgels/points to add to the constructed edgel feature. When using a standard vector (std::vector) overload function in C++, you can pass M_DEFAULT to this parameter and MIL will automatically determine the size based on the number of items in the vector passed to the PosXArrayPtr, PosYArrayPtr, or AngleArrayPtr parameter. ChainIndexArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumEdgelsOrPoints) array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumEdgelsOrPoints) Specifies the address of the array containing the index of the edge chain/pixel chain to which an edgel/point belongs. If specifying edgels/points from several separate chains, this index array identifies the connected edgels/points that are part of the same chain. The order of the edgels in the array determines the shape of the chain. This is especially useful if the gradient angle is not provided, and MmetPut() is interpolating the angle value. If unused, set this parameter to M_NULL. PosXArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumEdgelsOrPoints) array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumEdgelsOrPoints) Specifies the address of the array containing the X-coordinates of the edgels/points. To remove all the edgels/points in the feature, set this parameter to M_NULL. PosYArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumEdgelsOrPoints) array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumEdgelsOrPoints) Specifies the address of the array containing the Y-coordinates of the edgels/points. To remove all the edgels/points in the feature, set this parameter to M_NULL. AngleArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumEdgelsOrPoints) array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumEdgelsOrPoints) Specifies the address of the array containing the gradient angle (orientation) of the edgels. If adding points instead of edgels, or removing the edgels/points in the feature, set this parameter to M_NULL. Angle values must be mapped in the range of 0 to 255. That is, 0° corresponds to 0, and 360° corresponds to 256. ValueArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following: array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumEdgelsOrPoints) array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a constant std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] (and a maximum array rank for C# of 1) Required array size:(NumEdgelsOrPoints) Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_NULL. ControlFlag Specifies whether to automatically calculate the expected gradient angle of the edge at the specified points, when a gradient angle array has not been specified. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: To specify the function's control flag Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies to ignore this parameter, or in the case when points are passed, not to calculate the gradient angle. M_INTERPOLATE_ANGLE Specifies to determine the expected gradient angle of the edge at the specified points. This assumes that the specified points are a connected chain of points. Angles are calculated based on interpolation of consecutive points. This can be useful when limiting the angular range for fitted features. M_RESET Specifies to remove all the edgels/points from the specified constructed edgel feature. In this case, the NumEdgelsOrPoints parameter must be set to 0, and the array parameters to M_NULL.

Syntax MIL_ID MmetRestore( MIL_CONST_TEXT_PTR&nbsp;FileName, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*ContextIdPtr //out ) Description This function restores a metrology context that was previously saved to a file, using MmetSave() or MmetStream(). This function restores all the metrology context's settings and names that were in effect when the metrology context was saved. If you had associated a camera calibration context with the template reference in your metrology context and you did not save it with the context, you must re-associate the camera calibration context, using MmetControl() with M_ASSOCIATED_CALIBRATION. Moreover, if you had previously set drawing control types, using MgraControl() with M_DRAW_..., you must reset them since they were not saved with the context. When the restored metrology context is no longer required, release it using MmetFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during allocation; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the restored metrology context's lifetime and you must not manually free it. Parameters Parameters FileName Specifies the name and path of the file from which to restore the metrology context. The function handles (internally) the opening and closing of the file. This parameter can be set to one of the following: For specifying the file name and path Value Description M_INTERACTIVE [This is only applicable to Windows] Opens the File Open dialog box from which you can interactively specify the drive, directory, and name of the file. MIL_TEXT(\"FileName\") 1 Specifies the drive, directory, and name of the file (for example, \"C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). Typically, metrology contexts have an MET extension. To specify a file on a remote computer (under Distributed MIL), prefix the specified file name string with \"remote:///\" (for example, \"remote:///C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). 1 If you are passing the value in a variable, don't enclose it in MIL_TEXT(). SysId Specifies the system on which to restore the metrology context. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the system identifier Value Description M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). ControlFlag Specifies whether to restore, from the metrology context, the camera calibration context associated with the template reference. For specifying whether to restore the camera calibration context associated with the template reference Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the camera calibration context is not restored. M_WITH_CALIBRATION Specifies that the camera calibration context is restored. In this case, the camera calibration context must have been previously saved with the context, using MmetSave() or MmetStream() with M_WITH_CALIBRATION. The camera calibration information is restored from the same file as the metrology context. The camera calibration cannot be managed independently from the metrology context. When the metrology context is freed, the camera calibration is automatically freed as well. ContextIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the metrology context identifier or specifies the data type that the function should use to return the metrology context identifier. For retrieving the identifier or specifying how to return it Value Description M_NULL Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated metrology context ; in this case, a standard MIL identifier of type MIL_ID is returned. M_UNIQUE_ID Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated metrology context ; in this case, a MIL smart identifier of type MIL_UNIQUE_MET_ID is returned instead of a standard MIL identifier. This setting is only available when using C++11 (or later). A MIL smart identifier manages the lifespan of the MIL object it owns (similar to a std::unique_ptr). Note, you can use a MIL smart identifier as though it were a standard MIL identifier, except that you cannot use it to manually free the metrology context (it is freed automatically). For more information, see the MIL smart identifiers subsection of the MIL custom data types, void pointers, extensions, and portability functions section of Chapter 2: Building an application. Address in which to write the identifier Specifies the address of a MIL_ID in which to write the identifier of the restored metrology context. If restoration fails, M_NULL is written as the identifier. Return value The returned value is the metrology context identifier either as a standard identifier (MIL_ID) or a smart identifier (MIL_UNIQUE_MET_ID). If allocation fails, M_NULL is returned (or nullptr if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified). Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; milmetrol.lib.

This function is valid for all measured (MmetAddFeature() with M_MEASURED) and parametrically constructed (MmetAddFeature() with M_CONSTRUCTED and M_PARAMETRIC) features, unless otherwise specified. Typically, this function is used to move the position of a parametrically constructed local frame (which is considered a feature). When specifying a frame, all features and metrology regions that use that frame as their reference frame are moved accordingly. Note that you can also position features using MmetControl() with M_POSITION_X and M_POSITION_Y. However, in this case you must enter exact values; you cannot, for example, position features based on the results of another module, as you can using MmetSetPosition() with M_RESULT. If you want to move the whole metrology template (for example, when moving the global frame), you should use McalFixture() instead of MmetSetPosition(). Note that if you save the context using MmetSave(), the positional information set using MmetSetPosition() is not saved with the context; after restoring the context, you will need to call MmetSetPosition() again. MIL moves the specified feature relative to its reference frame, except for the global frame, which MIL moves relative to its default origin (0,0). If the target image is not calibrated, the global frame's default origin is aligned with the center of the top-left corner pixel of the target image. If the target image is calibrated, the global frame's default origin is aligned with the origin of the relative (world) coordinate system. If a camera calibration context is associated with the target image, set positional and dimensional values in real-world units. Otherwise, use pixel units. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler) in 64-bit mode, MmetSetPosition() internally calls the MIL_DOUBLE version of this function (MmetSetPositionDouble()). If you need to pass large integer values (including pointers), call the MIL_INT64 version of this function (MmetSetPositionInt64()). Parameters Parameters ContextId Specifies the identifier of the metrology context. The metrology context must have been previously allocated on the required system using MmetAlloc().

Note that the index of the global frame is 0. M_FEATURE_LABEL( MIL_INT FeatureLabel ) Specifies the label value of an existing individual feature. Parameters FeatureLabel This parameter specifies the label of the feature to position. You can set this parameter to the following: Value &gt; 0 Specifies the label.

Syntax void MmetSetRegion( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextId, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;FeatureLabelOrIndex, //in MIL_INT&nbsp;ReferenceFrameLabelOrIndex, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Geometry, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Param1, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Param2, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Param3, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Param4, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Param5, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Param6 //in ) Description This function sets a geometrically-defined ROI, referred to as a metrology region, for a feature within the template of the metrology context. For a physically measured feature, the metrology region delimits the area in the target image from which to establish the edgels of the feature to validate and measure. For a constructed feature, the metrology region delimits the area in the feature itself, which is used as the base feature to build the constructed feature. When you call this function, you can define the metrology region in one of the following ways. Explicitly specify the shape and size of the region. This is referred to as an explicitly-defined metrology region. Set the region's shape and size using a graphic in a 2D graphics list. This is referred to as a 2D graphics list metrology region. Define the metrology region based on other features by passing a derived metrology region object to this function. This is referred to as a derived metrology region. When using a 2D graphics list metrology region (M_FROM_GRAPHIC_LIST), the 2D graphics list must contain only one graphic and it must have the same geometric-shape as specified with the Geometry parameter of this function. The advantage of defining a 2D graphics list metrology region is that you can set it with respect to the relative coordinate system as well as set it interactively. When using a derived metrology region (M_FROM_DERIVED_GEOMETRY_REGION), you must allocate a derived metrology region object using MmetAlloc() with M_DERIVED_GEOMETRY_REGION, and then set it up using MmetControl() with M_REGION_.... Once you specify the geometry of the derived metrology region using the M_REGION_GEOMETRY control type, you can set most of the geometry's attributes either explicitly or derive them based on a feature. Use the corresponding M_REGION_..._TYPE control type to specify which. For example, instead of specifying explicit X- and Y-coordinates to set the position of a rectangular metrology region, you can derive its position according to the position of a point feature. The metrology region that you choose must be compatible with the geometry and operation of the feature you are adding, with MmetAddFeature(). For example, to add a physically measured circle feature that is built using a best fit operation, you can use an M_RING metrology region. The metrology region is set according to its feature's reference frame (ReferenceFrameLabelOrIndex). The global frame is the default. If the target image is not calibrated, the global frame's default origin (0,0) is aligned with the center of the top-left corner pixel of the target image. If the target image is calibrated, the global frame's default origin is aligned with the origin of the relative (world) coordinate system. To change the reference frame to a local frame, use MmetControl() with M_REFERENCE_FRAME. Local frames are coordinate systems located anywhere within the metrology template and defined as metrology features. A valid feature must not only fall within the metrology region, but its edgels' gradient angle must also fall along the region's orientation. Various control types can be used to set a valid relationship between the metrology region's orientation, and the edgels' gradient angle. For more information, see the Gradient angle subsection of the Eliminating unwanted edgels section of Chapter 21: Metrology. Note that you cannot specify a geometrically-defined region for a feature with a region of interest (ROI) set using MbufSetRegion(); you can only use metrology regions established with this function. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler) in 64-bit mode, MmetSetRegion() internally calls the MIL_DOUBLE version of this function (MmetSetRegionDouble()). If you need to pass large integer values (including pointers), call the MIL_INT64 version of this function (MmetSetRegionInt64()). Parameters Parameters ContextId Specifies the identifier of the metrology context containing the template in which to set the metrology region. The metrology context must have been previously allocated on the required system using MmetAlloc().

To change the reference frame, use MmetControl() with M_REFERENCE_FRAME. For specifying the reference frame Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_GLOBAL_FRAME. M_FEATURE_INDEX( MIL_INT FeatureIndex ) Specifies the index value of an existing reference frame feature. Parameters FeatureIndex This parameter specifies the index of the reference frame feature.

M_RADIAL is usually used to define a metrology region for a physically measured circular feature whose radius is unknown. Typically the origin of the metrology region is placed at the feature's center, resulting in valid edgels only being possible if they encircle the origin. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 360.0 Specifies the angle, in degrees, relative to the reference frame. This angle represents the infinite region's orientation. M_RECTANGLE Specifies that the feature will be established from a rectangular metrology region.

You can add the following value to the above-mentioned values to set a 2D graphics list metrology region. Unused parameters should be set to M_NULL. For setting a 2D graphics list metrology region Geometry Description Param1 Param2 Param3 Param4 Param5 Param6 M_FROM_GRAPHIC_LIST Specifies a 2D graphics list metrology region. Interactive graphics are allowed. Metrology ignores a graphic's fill color, if specified. When using M_FROM_GRAPHIC_LIST with M_ARC, the 2D graphics list must contain only one arc, created using MgraArc(), MgraArcAngle(), or MgraArcFill(). The arc must be circular; that is, its X- and Y-radius must be the same. When using M_FROM_GRAPHIC_LIST with M_RECTANGLE, the 2D graphics list must contain only one rectangle, created using MgraRect(), MgraRectAngle(), or MgraRectFill(). When using M_FROM_GRAPHIC_LIST with M_SEGMENT, the 2D graphics list must contain only one line, created using MgraLine(). Param1 Sets the identifier of the 2D graphics list with which to delimit the metrology region. The 2D graphics list must have been previously allocated on the required system using MgraAllocList(). The graphic's data (not the graphic itself) is taken as-is and is considered part of the metrology context with which it is used. For example, the graphic's metrology region information is now relative to the feature's reference frame (ReferenceFrameLabelOrIndex), is saved with the metrology context (MmetSave()), and is not affected by subsequent 2D graphics list modifications unless you re-call M_FROM_GRAPHIC_LIST. When using a 2D graphics list metrology region, you can first call McalFixture() with M_MOVE_RELATIVE and M_RESULT_MET, and specify the feature's reference frame. You can then ensure that positions are set and returned according to the specified reference frame. For more information, see the Moving using a metrology reference frame subsection of the Moving the relative coordinate system section of Chapter 29: Fixturing in MIL. The following can be specified for setting a derived metrology region. Unused parameters should be set to M_NULL. For setting a derived metrology region Geometry Description Param1 Param2 Param3 Param4 Param5 Param6 M_FROM_DERIVED_GEOMETRY_REGION Specifies a derived metrology region. To set up this metrology region, use MmetControl() with M_REGION_.... It is only recommended to use a derived metrology region when you need at least one other feature to set the metrology region. However, you can use a derived metrology region to set the metrology region using features, explicit values, or a combination of the two. Once you define this type of metrology region, the region information (not the derived metrology region object itself) is considered part of the metrology context with which it is used; for example, that information will be saved along with the context if you call MmetSave(). You can use M_FROM_DERIVED_GEOMETRY_REGION with any geometry. Param1 Sets the identifier of the derived metrology region object. The derived metrology region object must have been previously allocated on the required system using MmetAlloc() with M_DERIVED_GEOMETRY_REGION.

To inquire the number of bytes necessary to save a Model Finder context to memory stream, you should first call this function (MmetStream()) with M_INQUIRE_SIZE_BYTE. The content saved to memory stream is equivalent to the content saved to file. This function is equivalent to a file saved using MmetSave(). You can use this and other MIL stream functions, for example, to save all required MIL objects, as well as any other custom data, for your application to a memory stream. Once in a memory stream, you can write the stream to a single file or transfer it over a network. You are responsible for concatenating the streams and for saving the stream to file. All information about the previously allocated metrology context is saved, including all of the feature settings and geometric tolerance settings. However, any associated camera calibration contexts and drawing control type settings are not saved. All of the metrology context's settings and names that were in effect when the metrology context was saved will be restored. If you had associated a camera calibration context with the template reference in your metrology context and you did not save it with the context, you must re-associate the camera calibration context, using MmetControl() with M_ASSOCIATED_CALIBRATION. Also, if you had previously set drawing control types, using MgraControl() with M_DRAW_..., you must reset them since they were not saved with the context. Using MmetStream(), you can choose to save a backwards-compatible version of a MIL metrology context, which will work using a version of MIL that is up to one major release older than the current version (depending on which version is specified). For example, if you allocate a metrology context using MIL 10.0 and save it to version 9.0, you can restore this context on a computer where MIL 9.0 is installed. However, all settings and features unique to the higher version will be ignored when restored using the lower version. Besides saving backwards-compatible versions, you can also load or restore MIL metrology context saved using MIL version 8.0 or above. Settings that do not exist in the lower version will be filled with default values when the metrology context is loaded or restored. Parameters Parameters MemPtrOrFileName Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): MIL_TEXT_PTR [optionally, in C++: a reference to a MIL_STRING] Optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector of type MIL_UINT8 Specifies the file or memory stream. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be returned/specified. SysId Specifies the system on which to restore the metrology context. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Operation Specifies the operation to perform. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. StreamType Specifies the type of stream in which to store/from which to restore the metrology context. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For the type of stream Value Description M_FILE Specifies a file stream. M_MEMORY Specifies a memory stream. You are responsible for allocating a block of memory for the stream. Version Specifies the MIL version of the metrology context. When performing an M_LOAD or M_RESTORE operation, this parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ControlFlag Specifies whether to restore, from the file or memory stream, the camera calibration context associated with the template reference, or specifies to save, with the metrology context, the camera calibration context associated with the template reference. For specifying whether to restore or save the camera calibration contexts Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the camera calibration contexts are not saved or restored. M_WITH_CALIBRATION Specifies that the camera calibration context is saved or restored, depending on the Operation parameter. When restored, the camera calibration context must have been previously saved with the context, using MmetSave() or MmetStream() with M_WITH_CALIBRATION. The camera calibration information is restored from/ saved to the same file or memory stream as the metrology context. The camera calibration cannot be managed independently from the metrology context. When the metrology context is freed, the camera calibration is automatically freed as well. ContextMetIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write or from which to read the identifier of the metrology context. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be returned/specified. SizeByteVarPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the size of the metrology context, in bytes. If the size is not required, you can set this parameter to M_NULL. Note that the size of the metrology context will vary depending on the MIL version specified. Parameter associations The table below lists possible values for the MemPtrOrFileName, SysId, Operation, Version, and ContextMetIdPtr parameters. For performing the stream operation.

M_PROC_VERSION_100_SP7 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0 Service Pack 7. ContextMetIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable containing the identifier of the metrology context. The metrology context must have been previously allocated on the required system using MmetAlloc() with M_CONTEXT. M_LOAD Loads the content of a specified file or memory stream into a metrology context. MemPtrOrFileName Specifies the file or memory stream from which to load the context. M_INTERACTIVE [This is only applicable to Windows] Opens a dialog box from which you can interactively specify the drive, directory, and name of the file, when the StreamType parameter is set to M_FILE. MIL_TEXT(\"FileName\") 1 Specifies the drive, directory, and name of the file (for example, \"C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"), when the StreamType parameter is set to M_FILE. Metrology contexts typically have an MET file extension. The function handles (internally) the opening and closing of the file. To specify a file on a remote computer (under Distributed MIL), prefix the specified file name string with \"remote:///\" (for example, \"remote:///C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). MemPtr Specifies the address of the block of memory, when the StreamType parameter is set to M_MEMORY. The block of memory should be of type MIL_UINT8. The specified address must correspond to the first memory address in which the object is located, and the block of memory must contain the entire object. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler), you must cast the MIL_UINT8 pointer to a MIL_TEXT_PTR. SysId This parameter must be set to M_NULL. Version This parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. ContextMetIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable containing the identifier of the metrology context. The identifier returned is similar to the one returned if allocated using MmetAlloc() with M_CONTEXT. All previous settings are overwritten with those of the loaded context, or are set to the default value if the settings didn't exist in the version of MIL from which the context is being loaded. M_RESTORE Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the identifier of the metrology context. If the operation is not successful, M_NULL is returned. MemPtrOrFileName Specifies the file or memory stream from which to restore the context. M_INTERACTIVE [This is only applicable to Windows] Opens a dialog box from which you can interactively specify the drive, directory, and name of the file, when the StreamType parameter is set to M_FILE. MIL_TEXT(\"FileName\") 1 Specifies the drive, directory, and name of the file (for example, \"C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"), when the StreamType parameter is set to M_FILE. Metrology contexts typically have an MET file extension. The function handles (internally) the opening and closing of the file. To specify a file on a remote computer (under Distributed MIL), prefix the specified file name string with \"remote:///\" (for example, \"remote:///C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). MemPtr Specifies the address of the block of memory, when the StreamType parameter is set to M_MEMORY. The block of memory should be of type MIL_UINT8. The specified address must correspond to the first memory address in which the object is located, and the block of memory must contain the entire object. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler), you must cast the MIL_UINT8 pointer to a MIL_TEXT_PTR. SysId Specifies the system on which to allocate the metrology context. M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). Version This parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. ContextMetIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the identifier of the metrology context. The identifier returned is similar to the one returned if allocated using MmetAlloc() with M_CONTEXT. If the operation is not successful, M_NULL is returned. M_SAVE Saves a metrology context to a specified file or memory stream. MemPtrOrFileName Specifies the file or memory stream. M_INTERACTIVE [This is only applicable to Windows] Opens a dialog box from which you can interactively specify the drive, directory, and name of the file, when the StreamType parameter is set to M_FILE. MIL_TEXT(\"FileName\") 1 Specifies the drive, directory, and name of the file (for example, \"C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"), when the StreamType parameter is set to M_FILE. For easier use with other Matrox Imaging software products, when saving a metrology context to a file, use the MET file extension. The function handles (internally) the opening and closing of the file. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. To specify a file on a remote computer (under Distributed MIL), prefix the specified file name string with \"remote:///\" (for example, \"remote:///C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). MemPtr Specifies the address of the block of memory, when the StreamType parameter is set to M_MEMORY. The block of memory should be of type MIL_UINT8. The specified address must correspond to the first memory address in which to write, and the block of memory must be large enough to stream the entire object. To determine the required size, call this function with M_INQUIRE_SIZE_BYTE. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler), you must cast the MIL_UINT8 pointer to a MIL_TEXT_PTR. SysId This parameter must be set to M_NULL. Version Specifies the MIL version with which the metrology context must be compatible when saved. Note that the metrology context can only be up to one major release older (MIL 9.0) than the current version. M_DEFAULT Specifies the current version of MIL. M_PROC_VERSION_90 Specifies the version as being MIL 9.0. M_PROC_VERSION_90_PP1 Specifies the version as being MIL 9.0 Processing Pack 1. M_PROC_VERSION_90_PP2 Specifies the version as being MIL 9.0 Processing Pack 2. M_PROC_VERSION_100 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0. M_PROC_VERSION_100_PP1 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0 Processing Pack 1. M_PROC_VERSION_100_PP2 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0 Processing Pack 2. M_PROC_VERSION_100_PP3 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0 Processing Pack 3. M_PROC_VERSION_100_SP4 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0 Service Pack 4. M_PROC_VERSION_100_SP5 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0 Service Pack 5. M_PROC_VERSION_100_SP6 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0 Service Pack 6. M_PROC_VERSION_100_SP7 Specifies the version as being MIL 10.0 Service Pack 7. ContextMetIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable containing the identifier of the metrology context to save. The metrology context must have been previously allocated on the required system using MmetAlloc() with M_CONTEXT. 1 If you are passing the value in a variable, don't enclose it in MIL_TEXT().

A 3D blob analysis context contains information needed to perform a M3dblobCalculate() or M3dblobSegment() operation. You can also use M3dblobAlloc() to allocate a draw 3D blob analysis context for drawing results using M3dblobDraw3d(). When the 3D blob analysis context is no longer required, release it using M3dblobFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during allocation; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the 3D blob analysis context's lifetime and you must not manually free it.

The features are calculated from the blobs in the source point cloud container, and results are added to the specified result buffer, which is the result buffer that holds the blob segmentation computed from the same source point cloud. To specify the features to calculate, pass a 3D blob analysis context that has the required features enabled for calculation. Use M3dblobControl() to enable the features. Use M3dblobSegment() to fill the result buffer with blob identification information; the result buffer is used to identify which points in the specified container belong to the same blob. If you want to calculate features for a subset of the blobs in the point cloud, use M3dblobSelect() and M3dblobCombine() to fill a result buffer with blob identifying information for the required blobs. M3dblobCalculate() is optimized to not recalculate the same features twice. If you call the function several times without modifying the container's range component, M3dblobCalculate() only calculates features that are enabled in the context but not yet stored in the result buffer. If the range component has changed, the function removes all feature results from the result buffer and then calculates the features enabled in the context. Parameters Parameters CalculateContext3dblobId Specifies the identifier of the 3D blob analysis context that specifies the feature(s) to calculate, and other settings related to the 3D blob analysis operation. The context must have been previously allocated using M3dblobAlloc() with M_CALCULATE_CONTEXT. ContainerBufId Specifies the identifier of the 3D-processable point cloud container from which the blobs originate. This must be the same container previously passed to M3dblobSegment(), and its confidence component must not have been modified since then. If the segmentation was performed using a label image instead, this can be any container as long as the size of its range component is the same as the label image. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE). Result3dblobId Specifies the identifier of the 3D blob analysis result buffer that holds the blob segmentation, and in which to store results. The result buffer must have been previously allocated using M3dblobAllocResult(). LabelOrIndex Specifies the label or index of the blob(s) for which to calculate features, or specifies that you are calculating features for all blobs. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For specifying the blob label or index Value Description M_BLOB_INDEX( MIL_INT Index ) Specifies the index of the blob.

Syntax void M3dblobCombine( MIL_ID&nbsp;Src1Result3dblobId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;Src2Result3dblobId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;DstResult3dblobId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Operation, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function combines sets of blobs from different 3D blob analysis result buffers into one result buffer, according to the specified combine operation. The two source result buffers must hold sets of blob identifying information and feature results from two different selection operations (M3dblobSelect()). The subsets in the source result buffers must also originate from the same blob segmentation (M3dblobSegment()). M3dblobCombine() allows you to perform compound selections. For example, to select blobs that meet criterion 1 OR criterion 2, first call M3dblobSelect() twice with two different 3D blob analysis result buffers: once to select for criterion 1, and then a second time to select for criterion 2. Then, combine the two sets of blob identifying information and feature results using M3dblobCombine() with M_OR. Note that different feature results for the same blob in two source result buffers are combined and assigned to that same blob in the destination result buffer. For example, if source 1 has blob 42's feature A result and source 2 has blob 42's feature B result, then the destination result buffer will have both feature A and feature B results for blob 42 (provided the specified combine operation doesn't exclude blob 42). An error is reported if both sources contain the same feature's results, but the feature's values are different. To merge two blobs into one blob, use M3dblobControl() with M_MERGE. This function supports in-place processing; you can specify the identifier of the same result buffer for one of the sources and the destination. Parameters Parameters Src1Result3dblobId Specifies the identifier of the first source 3D blob analysis result buffer, previously allocated using M3dblobAllocResult() with M_SEGMENTATION_RESULT. Src2Result3dblobId Specifies the identifier of the second source 3D blob analysis result buffer, previously allocated using M3dblobAllocResult() with M_SEGMENTATION_RESULT. Note that the subset of blobs in this result buffer must originate from the same blob segmentation as the subset of blobs in the Src1Result3dblobId result buffer. DstResult3dblobId Specifies the identifier of the 3D blob analysis result buffer in which to store the results of the combine operation. In-place processing is supported; DstResult3dblobId can refer to the same result buffer as Src1Result3dblobId or Src2Result3dblobId. The result buffer must have been previously allocated using M3dblobAllocResult() with M_SEGMENTATION_RESULT. Operation Specifies how to combine the sets of blobs. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For specifying how to combine the sets of blobs Value Description M_AND Selects blobs for which selected feature results exist in both source result buffers. This is an intersection, equivalent to Src1 n Src2 in set language notation. M_OR Selects blobs for which selected feature results exist in any source result buffer. This is a union, equivalent to Src1 ? Src2 in set language notation. M_SUB Selects blobs for which selected feature results exist in the first source result buffer, but not the second. This is a subtraction, equivalent to Src1 - Src2 in set language notation. M_XOR Selects blobs for which selected feature results exist in one source result buffer, but not both. This is a symmetric difference, equivalent to (Src1 ? Src2) - (Src1 n Src2) in set language notation. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT.

M_COMPONENT_DISPARITY Specifies that the component stores a disparity map. M_COMPONENT_INFRARED Specifies that the component stores an intensity image of infrared light. M_COMPONENT_INTENSITY Specifies that the component stores an intensity image of visible light. M_COMPONENT_METADATA Specifies that the component stores metadata information. M_COMPONENT_MULTISPECTRAL Specifies that the component stores an intensity image where each band represents the intensity of a specific wavelength of light. M_COMPONENT_RANGE Specifies that the component stores 3D distance/position information. M_COMPONENT_REFLECTANCE Specifies that the component stores a reflectance map. M_COMPONENT_SCATTER Specifies that the component stores a scatter map. M_COMPONENT_ULTRAVIOLET Specifies that the component stores an intensity image of ultraviolet light. M_COMPONENT_UNDEFINED Specifies that the component stores information of an unknown type. M_CUSTOM_DISTANCE_MAX Sets the maximum difference within which two points are considered neighbors in the custom component. This control type is available only when you have specified a custom component with M_CUSTOM_DISTANCE_COMPONENT. If you set a non-infinite value, and the source container does not have the specified custom component, a MIL error is reported. M_DEFAULT Same as M_INFINITE. M_INFINITE Specifies that there is no custom component. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the maximum difference between points in the custom component. M_GLOBAL_NORMAL_DISTANCE_MAX Sets the maximum angle between the normal of a point and a blob's average normal, for the point to be added to the blob. This control type can be used to segment a point cloud into planar blobs to distinguish between relatively flat regions. You can specify how to calculate the angle with M_NORMAL_DISTANCE_MODE. Setting a smaller maximum angle forces the blobs into more planar (flatter) regions, allowing for less variation in each blob. Since this control is solely based upon normal vectors, parallel but distinct blobs can still merge together, unless M_GLOBAL_PLANE_DISTANCE_MAX is specified as well. This control type is available when an M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL component exists in the source container. If the normals component is not present, the segmentation will fail and the operation's status returns M_MISSING_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL, when requested using M3dblobGetResult() with M_STATUS. M_DEFAULT Same as M_INFINITE. M_INFINITE Specifies not to consider the angle. 0.0 &lt; Value &lt;= 180.0 Specifies the maximum angle, in degrees. M_GLOBAL_PLANE_DISTANCE_MAX Sets the maximum distance between a point and a blob's average plane, for the point to be added to the blob. The blob's average plane is defined by the average normal and passes through the centroid. This control type requires that M_GLOBAL_NORMAL_DISTANCE_MAX has been set, and is used to prevent parallel planar blobs from merging together. M_DEFAULT Same as M_INFINITE. M_INFINITE Specifies not to consider the distance. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the maximum distance. M_MAX_DISTANCE Sets the maximum distance within which two points are considered neighbors. M_DEFAULT Same as M_INFINITE. M_INFINITE Specifies that there is no maximum distance. Instead, the function will use M_MAXIMUM_NUMBER_NEIGHBORS to determine a point's neighborhood. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the maximum distance. M_MAX_DISTANCE_MODE Sets whether to use, for the maximum distance between points, the value set with M_MAX_DISTANCE or an automatic threshold. This is the maximum distance within which two points are considered neighbors. M_DEFAULT Same as M_USER_DEFINED. M_AUTO Specifies to automatically calculate the maximum distance. M_USER_DEFINED Specifies to use the value set with M_MAX_DISTANCE. M_MAXIMUM_NUMBER_NEIGHBORS Sets the maximum number of neighbors to consider at each point. If there are more neighbors than the specified maximum, only the closest points are kept. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 49. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the maximum number of neighbor points. M_NEIGHBOR_SEARCH_MODE Sets the search mode for finding the neighbors of a point. Note that M_ORGANIZED is usually faster, but is less robust to noise. M_DEFAULT Same as M_TREE. M_MESH Specifies to use the point cloud's mesh component to determine the neighbors of a point. A mesh's triangular faces are composed of connected neighboring points. This option is available only when the source container has an M_COMPONENT_MESH_MIL component. If the mesh component is not present, the segmentation will fail and the operation's status returns M_MISSING_COMPONENT_MESH_MIL, when requested using M3dblobGetResult() with M_STATUS. M_ORGANIZED Specifies to use the point cloud's organizational structure to determine the neighbors of a point. This option is supported only for an organized point cloud. When M_ORGANIZED is specified, you must set either M_MAXIMUM_NUMBER_NEIGHBORS or M_NEIGHBORHOOD_ORGANIZED_SIZE to determine the extent of the neighborhood. If the point cloud is unorganized, the segmentation will fail and the operation's status returns M_CONTAINER_NOT_ORGANIZED, when requested using M3dblobGetResult() with M_STATUS. M_TREE Specifies to use a KD tree search mode to determine a point's neighbors. When M_TREE is specified, you must also set M_MAXIMUM_NUMBER_NEIGHBORS. M_NEIGHBORHOOD_ORGANIZED_SIZE Sets the neighborhood size, which must be an odd number, when finding the neighbors of a point in an organized point cloud. The size determines the number of elements along a row or column of the 2D buffer of the range and confidence components. For example, if you set M_NEIGHBORHOOD_ORGANIZED_SIZE to 7, the neighborhood is a 7-element by 7-element region in the source container's 2D grid organization (specifically, in the organized point cloud's M_COMPONENT_RANGE and M_COMPONENT_CONFIDENCE components). Calculations for points close to the edge of the 2D buffer use a clipped neighborhood. This control type is supported only when using an organized point cloud and only if M_NEIGHBOR_SEARCH_MODE is set to M_ORGANIZED. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 7. Value &gt;= 3 Specifies the organized neighborhood size, in number of pixels; the specified value must be an odd number. M_NORMAL_DISTANCE_MAX Sets the maximum angle between normal vectors within which two points are considered neighbors. Specify how to calculate the angle with M_NORMAL_DISTANCE_MODE. This control type is available when an M_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL component exists in the source container. If the normals component is not present, the segmentation will fail and the operation's status returns M_MISSING_COMPONENT_NORMALS_MIL, when requested using M3dblobGetResult() with M_STATUS. M_DEFAULT Same as M_INFINITE. M_INFINITE Specifies not to consider the normals. 0.0 &lt; Value &lt;= 180.0 Specifies the maximum angle, in degrees. M_NORMAL_DISTANCE_MAX_MODE Sets whether to use, for the maximum angle between normal vectors, the value set with M_NORMAL_DISTANCE_MAX or an automatic threshold. This is the maximum angle between the normal vectors of two neighboring points for the points to be considered neighbors. M_DEFAULT Same as M_USER_DEFINED. M_AUTO Specifies to automatically calculate the maximum angle. M_USER_DEFINED Specifies to use the value set with M_NORMAL_DISTANCE_MAX. M_NORMAL_DISTANCE_MODE Sets how to calculate the angle difference between the normal vectors of two points. If required, set M_NORMAL_DISTANCE_MODE to M_ORIENTATION to ensure that the segmentation is invariant to the normal viewpoint. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DIRECTION. M_DIRECTION Specifies to calculate the angle from 0 to 180 degrees. M_ORIENTATION Specifies to calculate the angle from 0 to 90 degrees; when specified, this control value considers flipped normals to be the same. M_NUMBER_OF_POINTS_MAX Sets the maximum number of points for a blob to be considered valid. Blobs with more points than the specified value will be discarded and their points assigned the label 0. You can use M_NUMBER_OF_POINTS_MAX to remove the background, which is often the largest blob. M_DEFAULT Same as M_INFINITE. M_INFINITE Specifies that there is no maximum number of points. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the maximum number of points. M_NUMBER_OF_POINTS_MIN Sets the minimum number of points for a blob to be considered valid. Blobs with fewer points than the specified value will be discarded and their points will be assigned the label 0. You can use M_NUMBER_OF_POINTS_MIN to remove blobs corresponding to a few isolated points. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1. Value &gt; 0 Specifies the minimum number of points. M_RELABEL_CONSECUTIVE Sets whether to force the labels to be consecutive from 1 to M_MAX_LABEL_VALUE. When calling M3dblobSegment() with a label image, this will recompute the labels instead of using those from the label image. M_RELABEL_CONSECUTIVE sets each blob label to the blob's index + 1. Note that this operation will change the value of M_MAX_LABEL_VALUE. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies not to force the labels to be consecutive. M_ENABLE Specifies to force the labels to be consecutive. M_SEGMENTATION_MODE Sets the type of segmentation to perform. M_DEFAULT Same as M_EUCLIDEAN. M_EUCLIDEAN Specifies to segment the point cloud based on the (Euclidean) distance between points. Use the other segmentation context control settings to modify the segmentation criteria. M_LABEL_IMAGE Specifies to copy a label image into the specified result buffer (M3dblobSegment()). You can use M_LABEL_IMAGE to copy an external segmentation (for example, a label image created using the 2D Blob Analysis module). All segmentation control types except M_NUMBER_OF_POINTS_MAX, M_NUMBER_OF_POINTS_MIN, and M_RELABEL_CONSECUTIVE are ignored in this mode. Note that you can use M3dblobSegment() with the predefined context M_SEGMENTATION_CONTEXT_LABEL_IMAGE. In this case, all segmentation context control types are set to their default, except for M_SEGMENTATION_MODE which is set to M_LABEL_IMAGE. M_WHOLE_IMAGE Specifies to group all valid points into a single blob, which allows you to perform calculations on the entire point cloud. All segmentation control types except M_NUMBER_OF_POINTS_MAX and M_NUMBER_OF_POINTS_MIN are ignored in this mode. Note that you can use M3dblobSegment() with the predefined context M_SEGMENTATION_CONTEXT_WHOLE_IMAGE. In this case, all segmentation context control types are set to their default, except for M_SEGMENTATION_MODE which is set to M_WHOLE_IMAGE. M_TIMEOUT Sets the maximum amount of time for M3dblobSegment() to complete the blob segmentation operation before generating a time-out error. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that there is no timeout value. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the timeout value, in msec. Segmentation 3D blob analysis result ID, for a single blob or all blobs Specifies a segmentation 3D blob analysis result buffer, allocated using M3dblobAllocResult() with M_SEGMENTATION_RESULT, and used to store M3dblobSegment() results. M_CUSTOM_FEATURE( MIL_INT N ) Adds or modifies the computed values of a custom feature of the blob(s). You can use a custom feature (using M3dblobSelect() and M3dblobSort()) as if it was a regular feature computed using M3dblobCalculate(). To add a custom feature, you can set M_CUSTOM_FEATURE() to hold a computation obtained from other feature results. For example, to add a measure of the blobs' semi-oriented box elongation (width divided by height), you can calculate the semi-oriented box (using M3dblobCalculate()), retrieve the box's width and height (using M3dblobGetResult()), and then use M3dblobControl() to add the width-divided-by-height value to M_CUSTOM_FEATURE(). The resulting custom feature is stored in the result buffer and is subsequently selectable and sortable using M3dblobSelect() and M3dblobSort(), respectively. Filters: fc_A: [{I: f_3}] Parameters N Specifies the index of the custom feature. 0 &lt;= Value &lt; 1024 Specifies the valid index of the custom feature. ControlValue Specifies the custom feature's computed value. M_MERGE Merges the blob specified using the ControlValue parameter with the one specified using the LabelOrIndex parameter. The resulting blob retains the label of the LabelOrIndex blob. Since this operation changes the segmentation (unlike when using M3dblobSelect(), M3dblobSort(), and M3dblobCombine()), this result buffer becomes incompatible with sibling result buffers (for example, you cannot combine the set of blobs in this result buffer with those in sibling result buffers). Note that, since the merge changes the number of blobs, the index of any blob might change. If the two blobs contain calculated features, the merged blob will contain all features that can be trivially merged (for example, M_BOUNDING_BOX and M_PCA), but not features that would need to be recomputed from scratch (for example, minimum/maximum diameter and nearest blob). The merged blob will also never contain any custom features. For a successful merge, both blobs must be singular; that is, M_ALL_BLOBS must not be specified. If you want to treat all blobs as one, use M3dblobSegment() with either the predefined context M_SEGMENTATION_CONTEXT_WHOLE_IMAGE or a previously allocated M_SEGMENTATION_CONTEXT context for which you have set M_SEGMENTATION_MODE to M_WHOLE_IMAGE. M_BLOB_INDEX( MIL_INT Index ) Specifies the index of the blob. Parameters Index Specifies the index. M_BLOB_LABEL( MIL_INT Label ) Specifies the label of the blob. Parameters Label Specifies the label. M_REMOVE_FEATURE Sets the custom feature(s) to remove from the blob. If a feature is not available, no error is reported. M_CUSTOM_FEATURE( MIL_INT N ) Removes a custom feature from the blob(s). Parameters N Specifies the index of the custom feature. 0 &lt;= Value &lt; 1024 Specifies the valid index of the custom feature. M_ALL Specifies to remove all custom features. Segmentation 3D blob analysis result ID, for general results Specifies a segmentation 3D blob analysis result buffer, allocated using M3dblobAllocResult() with M_SEGMENTATION_RESULT, and used to store M3dblobSegment() results. M_INDEX_MODE Sets how to interpret the LabelOrIndex parameter in all functions (such as M3dblobGetResult()) that use the 3D blob analysis result buffer. M_DEFAULT Same as M_USE_MACRO. M_INDEX Specifies that the index will be passed directly to the function's LabelOrIndex parameter, without any macros. M_LABEL Specifies that the label will be passed directly to the function's LabelOrIndex parameter, without any macros. M_USE_MACRO Specifies that the label or index must be passed using the macro M_BLOB_LABEL() or M_BLOB_INDEX(). M_RELABEL_CONSECUTIVE Relabels the blobs in consecutive order, from 1 to M_MAX_LABEL_VALUE. M_RELABEL_CONSECUTIVE sets each blob label to the blob's index + 1. Note that this operation will change the value of M_MAX_LABEL_VALUE. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default behavior. M_RESET Removes all results from the segmentation 3D blob analysis result buffer. This does not delete the result buffer, as is the case with M3dblobFree(). M_DEFAULT Specifies the default behavior. M_STOP_SEGMENT Stops the current execution of M3dblobSegment(). This can only be done from another thread of higher priority. Results already available in the result buffer become invalid and will be discarded. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default behavior. Combination values for [when ContextOrResult3dblobId=Calculate 3D blob analysis context ID: M_FERET_GENERAL]. You can add one of the following values to the above-mentioned value to set the direction along which to calculate the custom Feret. For specifying the custom Feret direction ControlType Description ControlValue M_FERET_DIRECTION_X Sets the X-component of the direction vector. Value Specifies the X-component of the direction vector. The default value is 0.0. M_FERET_DIRECTION_Y Sets the Y-component of the direction vector. Value Specifies the Y-component of the direction vector. The default value is 0.0. M_FERET_DIRECTION_Z Sets the Z-component of the direction vector. Value Specifies the Z-component of the direction vector. The default value is 0.0. Combination value for [when ContextOrResult3dblobId=Calculate 3D blob analysis context ID: M_NEAREST_BLOB]. You can add the following value to the above-mentioned value to set the maximum distance to the nearest blob. For specifying the maximum distance to the nearest blob ControlType Description ControlValue M_MAX_DISTANCE Sets the maximum distance within which MIL considers a nearby blob to be the closest. M_DEFAULT Same as M_INFINITE. M_INFINITE Specifies no distance constraint. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the maximum distance. If the nearest blob is further than the specified value, the returned label will be 0.

If you need to pass large integer values (including pointers), call the MIL_INT64 version of this function (M3dblobControlDrawInt64()). Parameters Parameters DrawContext3dblobId Specifies the identifier of the draw 3D blob analysis context to control. The 3D blob analysis context must have been previously allocated on the system using M3dblobAlloc() with M_DRAW_3D_CONTEXT. Operation Specifies the draw operation.

See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. CopyType Specifies the type of copy operation to perform. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. Parameter associations The tables below list possible values for the DstMilObjectId and CopyType parameters. For copying general results from the source 3D blob analysis result buffer For copying the results of a specific blob or all blobs from the source 3D blob analysis result buffer For copying the results of a specific blob from the source 3D blob analysis result buffer To copy general results, set the CopyType parameter to one of the following values. In this case, you must set SrcLabelOrIndex to M_GENERAL or M_DEFAULT. For copying general results from the source 3D blob analysis result buffer CopyType Description DstMilObjectId M_INDEX_IMAGE Specifies to copy blob indices into an image buffer, creating an index image. For each point in a blob, this operation copies the blob's index to a corresponding pixel location in the image buffer. This essentially sets each pixel in the index image to the index of its corresponding blob. Note that the point information is set in the image buffer at the same location as the point's location in the range component of its point cloud container. Points that are not part of any blob are given the value of -1 in signed buffers, and set to the maximum buffer value in unsigned buffers. Image buffer identifier Specifies the identifier of an image buffer in which to copy results. The image buffer must be a 1-band buffer and have a bit depth deep enough to hold the largest index + 1 (M_NUMBER). The image buffer size must equal the size of the container used for the segmentation, in both X and Y. To retrieve the size, use M3dblobGetResult() with M_RESULT_IMAGE_SIZE_X and M_RESULT_IMAGE_SIZE_Y. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. M_LABEL_IMAGE Specifies to copy blob labels into an image buffer, creating a label image. For each point in a blob, this operation copies the blob's label to a corresponding pixel location in the image buffer. This essentially sets each pixel in the label image to the label of its corresponding blob. Note that the point information is set in the image buffer at the same location as the point's location in the range component of its point cloud container. Points that are not part of any blob are given the label 0. Image buffer identifier Specifies the identifier of an image buffer in which to copy results. The image buffer must be a 1-band buffer and have a bit depth deep enough to hold the largest label (M_MAX_LABEL_VALUE).

To retrieve the size, use M3dblobGetResult() with M_RESULT_IMAGE_SIZE_X and M_RESULT_IMAGE_SIZE_Y. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. M_RESULT Specifies to copy the whole source 3D blob analysis result buffer into the specified destination 3D blob analysis result buffer. Segmentation 3D blob analysis result buffer identifier Specifies the identifier of the 3D blob analysis result buffer in which to copy results. The result buffer must have been previously allocated using M3dblobAllocResult() with M_SEGMENTATION_RESULT.

In this case, you must set SrcLabelOrIndex to a specific blob, using M_BLOB_INDEX() or M_BLOB_LABEL(), or to M_ALL_BLOBS for all blobs. For copying the results of a specific blob or all blobs from the source 3D blob analysis result buffer CopyType Description DstMilObjectId M_MASK_IMAGE Specifies to create a mask image whose pixels are non-zero for blob points, and zero otherwise. For each point in a blob, this operation uses the point's location in its container to assign a non-zero value to a corresponding pixel location in the image buffer. The non-zero value is 1 for floating-point image buffers and -1 for signed image buffers. For unsigned image buffers, the maximum buffer value is used. All other pixels in the buffer are set to 0. Image buffer identifier Specifies the identifier of an image buffer in which to copy results. The image buffer must be a 1-band buffer and its size must equal the size of the container used for the segmentation, in both X and Y. To retrieve the size, use M3dblobGetResult() with M_RESULT_IMAGE_SIZE_X and M_RESULT_IMAGE_SIZE_Y. This image buffer must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. To copy the results of a specific blob, set the CopyType parameter to one of the following values. In this case, you must set SrcLabelOrIndex to a specific blob using M_BLOB_INDEX() or M_BLOB_LABEL().

Set the draw operations and options for the draw using M3dblobControlDraw(). Note that the specified draw 3D blob analysis result buffer must contain the result of an M3dblobSegment() operation, and, if you want to draw blob features, results of an M3dblobCalculate() operation. Use M3dblobControlDraw() to set whether to draw blob points, excluded points, and/or calculated blob features. The resulting draw has the following structure: Top node --&gt; Blobs --&gt; Features. The subnodes for blobs 0, 1, N are ordered in the 3D graphics list in the same sequence as the blob indices. If the excluded points are drawn (M_DRAW_EXCLUDED_POINTS set to M_ENABLE, using M3dblobControlDraw()), they are the last subnode.

ContainerBufId Specifies the identifier of the 3D-processable point cloud container from which to retrieve the blobs to draw. This must be the same container previously passed to M3dblobSegment(), and its confidence component must not have been modified since then. If the segmentation was performed using a label image instead, this can be any container as long as the size of its range component is the same as the label image. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE). Result3dblobId Specifies the identifier of the 3D blob analysis result buffer from which to retrieve calculated results and/or information about the blobs. The result buffer must have been previously allocated using M3dblobAllocResult().

This is useful when you want to calculate a feature or perform an operation that is too complex for M3dblobCalculate(), such as fitting a geometry to a specific blob (M3dmetFit()), or creating a mesh for a specific blob (M3dimMesh()). Note that this function never copies a M_COMPONENT_MESH_MIL component to the destination container, even if you specify to extract all blobs. Parameters Parameters SrcContainerBufId Specifies the identifier of the 3D-processable point cloud container from which to extract the blobs. This must be the same container previously passed to M3dblobSegment(), and its confidence component must not have been modified since then. If the segmentation was performed using a label image instead, this can be any container as long as the size of the container's range component is the same as the label image. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE). Result3dblobId Specifies the identifier of the 3D blob analysis result buffer in which the blob segmentation is stored. The result buffer must have been previously allocated using M3dblobAllocResult(). LabelOrIndex Specifies the label or index of the blob to extract, or specifies to extract all blobs. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For specifying the blob label or index Value Description M_BLOB_INDEX( MIL_INT Index ) Specifies the index of the blob. Parameters Index Specifies the index. 0 &lt;= Value &lt; M_NUMBER Specifies the valid index of a blob. M_BLOB_LABEL( MIL_INT Label ) Specifies the label of the blob. Parameters Label Specifies the label. 1 &lt;= Value &lt;= M_MAX_LABEL_VALUE Specifies the valid label of a blob. M_ALL_BLOBS Specifies to extract all blobs. DstContainerBufId Specifies the identifier of the destination point cloud container in which to save the extracted blobs. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must not be a child container. Options Specifies how to organize the destination point cloud. For specifying how to organize the destination point cloud Value Description M_AUTO Chooses the fastest option. This depends on the size and density of the blob(s) relative to the source container. M_SAME Specifies to copy all the source container's components (except any mesh component) into the destination container; no change is made to the size of the components. The confidence score for non-extracted blob points is set to zero. M_SHRINK Specifies to copy, from source to destination, the smallest region that holds all valid points of the extracted blob(s), in all components (except any mesh component). Note that the region is a rectangular region within the bands of the 2D data buffers that hold point cloud data. The confidence score for non-extracted blob points is set to zero. M_SHRINK_VERTICALLY Specifies to copy all the source container's components (except any mesh component) into the destination container, maintaining the source's size in X (that is, the width of its range component), but shrinking the size in Y to the smallest interval that contains all extracted blob points. You can use M_SHRINK_VERTICALLY to merge consecutive scans in continuous scanning applications. The confidence score for non-extracted blob points is set to zero. M_UNORGANIZED Specifies to store results in an unorganized point cloud. Components in the destination container will store results of the extract operation in 1D, unorganized buffers, ordered in the same manner as M_PIXEL_X and M_PIXEL_Y. ControlFlag Specifies which components will be affected by the operation. For specifying whether to apply the operation to all components Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the operation will only affect the core components of a 3D-processable container. These components are listed in the description of MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE. All other components are copied to the destination container unmodified. M_APPLY_TO_ALL_COMPONENTS Specifies that the operation will affect the core components of a 3D-processable container, as well as any other component (including custom components) that has the same dimension as M_COMPONENT_RANGE. These components must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with them. For example, using a component that is an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Note that if a custom component has an associated calibration context, the component's information is extracted, but its calibration context is discarded. If the resulting operation yields an empty container with 0 valid points, the components with the same dimensions are not created and will not exist in the destination container.

Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the maximum distance value. M_MAX_LABEL_VALUE Retrieves the maximum label value of all blobs in the result buffer. Label values for blobs are generated when a call to M3dblobCalculate() is made. The maximum label value is not necessarily the same as the total number of blobs (M_NUMBER) because some label values might not be used. You can call M3dblobGetResult() with M_LABEL_IMAGE_SIZE_BIT to determine the bit depth required when creating a label image using M3dblobCopyResult(). Note that if zero is returned, no blobs were found. ResultArrayPtr extra info Data type info: Data type: address of a MIL_INT Data type: address of a MIL_INT M_NORMAL_DISTANCE_MAX Retrieves the maximum angle between normal vectors within which two points are considered neighbors.

In this case, you must set LabelOrIndex to M_BLOB_INDEX(), M_BLOB_LABEL(), or M_ALL_BLOBS. If LabelOrIndex is M_ALL_BLOBS, the results are returned in an array instead of a single value. These results are available after an M3dblobSegment() operation, and remain available after an M3dblobCalculate() operation that uses the results of the blob segmentation. If M3dblobSegment() has not yet been called on this result, you will receive an error. For retrieving results that are always available from a single blob or all blobs ResultType Description ResultArrayPtr - Possible values returned M_BLOB_TOUCHING_IMAGE_BORDERS Retrieves information about which side(s) of the container or label image that the blob touches. This is either the side(s) of an organized point cloud container's range component or a 2D label image.

Syntax MIL_ID M3dblobRestore( MIL_CONST_TEXT_PTR&nbsp;FileName, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*Context3dblobIdPtr //out ) Description This function restores a 3D blob analysis context that was previously saved to a file, using M3dblobSave() or M3dblobStream(). This function restores all of the 3D blob analysis context's settings that were in effect when it was saved. When the restored 3D blob analysis context is no longer required, release it using M3dblobFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during restoration; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the 3D blob analysis context's lifetime and you must not manually free it. Parameters Parameters FileName Specifies the name and path of the file from which to restore the 3D blob analysis context. The function handles (internally) the opening and closing of the file. This parameter can be set to one of the following: For specifying the file name and path Value Description M_INTERACTIVE [This is only applicable to Windows] Opens the File Open dialog box from which you can interactively specify the drive, directory, and name of the file. MIL_TEXT(\"FileName\") 1 Specifies the drive, directory, and name of the file (for example, \"C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). Typically, 3D blob analysis context files have an M3DBLOB extension. To specify a file on a remote computer (under Distributed MIL), prefix the specified file name string with \"remote:///\" (for example, \"remote:///C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). 1 If you are passing the value in a variable, don't enclose it in MIL_TEXT(). SysId Specifies the system on which to restore the 3D blob analysis context. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the system Value Description M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. Context3dblobIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the 3D blob analysis context identifier or specifies the data type that the function should use to return the 3D blob analysis context identifier. For retrieving the identifier or specifying how to return it Value Description M_NULL Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated 3D blob analysis context ; in this case, a standard MIL identifier of type MIL_ID is returned. M_UNIQUE_ID Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated 3D blob analysis context ; in this case, a MIL smart identifier of type MIL_UNIQUE_3DBLOB_ID is returned instead of a standard MIL identifier. This setting is only available when using C++11 (or later). A MIL smart identifier manages the lifespan of the MIL object it owns (similar to a std::unique_ptr). Note, you can use a MIL smart identifier as though it were a standard MIL identifier, except that you cannot use it to manually free the 3D blob analysis context (it is freed automatically). For more information, see the MIL smart identifiers subsection of the MIL custom data types, void pointers, extensions, and portability functions section of Chapter 2: Building an application. Address in which to write the calculate 3D blob analysis context identifier Specifies the address of a MIL_ID in which to write the identifier of the allocated calculate 3D blob analysis context. If allocation fails, M_NULL is written as the identifier. Address in which to write the draw 3D blob analysis context identifier Specifies the address of a MIL_ID in which to write the identifier of the allocated draw 3D blob analysis context identifier. If allocation fails, M_NULL is written as the identifier. Address in which to write the segmentation 3D blob analysis context identifier Specifies the address of a MIL_ID in which to write the identifier of the allocated segmentation 3D blob analysis context identifier. If allocation fails, M_NULL is written as the identifier. Return value The returned value is the 3D blob analysis context identifier either as a standard identifier (MIL_ID) or a smart identifier (MIL_UNIQUE_3DBLOB_ID). If allocation fails, M_NULL is returned (or nullptr if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified). Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; mil3dblob.lib.

The blob segmentation is calculated from the specified point cloud or it is defined from the specified label image. When you specify a point cloud, the blob segmentation is performed according to the settings of the segmentation 3D blob analysis context. To set up the context, use M3dblobControl(). When you specify a label image to define the blob segmentation, the label image is copied to the result buffer. For example, you can specify a label image created using the (2D) Blob Analysis module (specifically, a blob identifier image created using MblobLabel()). Each pixel in the label image is set to a value that will identify corresponding points in a point cloud as belonging to a specific blob, using a label that is unique for each blob. Pixels with a value of zero represent points that are not part of any blob. Note that the location of each pixel in the label image corresponds to the point at the same location in the point cloud container. Also note that invalid points in the point cloud must have a label of zero; otherwise, functions that use the points might try to operate on the invalid points, causing an error. The blob segmentation defines which points are considered to be in the same blob when M3dblobCalculate() is called. The result buffer will hold the blob segmentation as well as a list of blob labels, to which indices are assigned (in whatever order the blobs happen to be in the list). You can specify to relabel the blobs in consecutive order, using M3dblobControl() with M_RELABEL_CONSECUTIVE, for either a context (when calling M3dblobSegment()), or a segmentation result (after calling M3dblobSegment()). Parameters Parameters SegmentationContext3dblobId Specifies a segmentation 3D blob analysis context. For specifying the segmentation 3D blob analysis context identifier Value Description M_SEGMENTATION_CONTEXT_LABEL_IMAGE Specifies a predefined segmentation 3D blob analysis context with all segmentation context control types (M3dblobControl()) set to their default, except for M_SEGMENTATION_MODE which is set to M_LABEL_IMAGE. Use this predefined context to copy an external label image into the 3D blob analysis result buffer. M_SEGMENTATION_CONTEXT_WHOLE_IMAGE Specifies a predefined segmentation 3D blob analysis context with all segmentation context control types (M3dblobControl()) set to their default, except for M_SEGMENTATION_MODE which is set to M_WHOLE_IMAGE. Use this predefined context to count all valid points as belonging to a single blob; any point whose confidence score is 0 will not be included as part of the blob. MIL segmentation 3D blob analysis context identifier Specifies the identifier of a segmentation 3D blob analysis context, previously allocated using M3dblobAlloc() with M_SEGMENTATION_CONTEXT. If a previously allocated context is specified, the function applies the segmentation control settings specified using M3dblobControl(). ContainerOrLabelImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the 3D-processable point cloud container or image buffer from which to calculate the segmentation. You can specify either a container or a label image, depending on the segmentation context's M_SEGMENTATION_MODE. When M_SEGMENTATION_MODE is set to M_WHOLE_IMAGE, M_EUCLIDEAN, or M_DEFAULT, ContainerOrLabelImageBufId must be a container. When M_SEGMENTATION_MODE is set to M_LABEL_IMAGE, ContainerOrLabelImageBufId must be an image in which each pixel is set to a value that will identify corresponding points in a point cloud as belonging to a specific blob, using a label that is unique for each blob. Pixels with a value of zero represent points that are not part of any blob. For specifying the container or label image buffer identifier Value Description Label image buffer identifier Specifies the identifier of a label image buffer. The label image must be a 1-band 8, 16, or 32-bit unsigned image buffer. If you specify an image buffer that has an ROI associated with it, the ROI must be in raster format; otherwise, you will get an error. Points outside the ROI will not be part of any blob. Point cloud container identifier Specifies the identifier of a point cloud container. The container must have been previously allocated using MbufAllocContainer() with M_PROC, and must be 3D-processable (that is, if you call MbufInquireContainer() with M_3D_PROCESSABLE, the function returns M_PROCESSABLE). Result3dblobId Specifies the identifier of the segmentation 3D blob analysis result buffer. The result buffer must have been allocated using M3dblobAllocResult() with M_SEGMENTATION_RESULT.

Note that, when passing the sorted result buffer to functions where you might specify an index (for example, M3dblobExtract()), the blob indices will have changed because of the sort. For other functions (such as M3dblobCombine()), the sorted result buffer is still compatible with other result buffers that come from the same blob segmentation (M3dblobSegment()). This function supports in-place processing; you can specify the identifier of the same result buffer for the source and the destination. Parameters Parameters SrcResult3dblobId Specifies the identifier of the source 3D blob analysis result buffer from which to sort the blob indices. DstResult3dblobId Specifies the identifier of the destination 3D blob analysis result buffer into which to copy the sorted indices, feature results, and other blob information. In-place processing is supported; DstResult3dblobId can refer to the same result buffer as SrcResult3dblobId. Feature1 Specifies the first feature to use for sorting.

Syntax void M3dblobStream( MIL_TEXT_PTR&nbsp;MemPtrOrFileName, //in-out MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Operation, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;StreamType, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Version, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*Context3dblobIdPtr, //in-out MIL_INT&nbsp;*SizeByteVarPtr //out ) Description This function can load, restore, or save a 3D blob analysis context from/to a file or memory stream. To inquire the number of bytes necessary to save a 3D blob analysis context to a memory stream, you should first call this function (M3dblobStream()) with M_INQUIRE_SIZE_BYTE. The content saved to memory stream is equivalent to the content saved to file. In addition, any file saved using this function is equivalent to a file saved with M3dblobSave(). You can use this and other MIL stream functions, for example, to save all required MIL objects, as well as any other custom data, for your application to a memory stream. Once in a memory stream, you can write the stream to a single file or transfer it over a network. You are responsible for concatenating the streams and for saving the stream to file. This function restores all of the object's settings that were in effect when the object was saved. Parameters Parameters MemPtrOrFileName Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): MIL_TEXT_PTR [optionally, in C++: a reference to a MIL_STRING] Optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector of type MIL_UINT8 Specifies the file or memory stream.

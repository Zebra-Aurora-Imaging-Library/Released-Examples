  "text": " Mmeas functions Synopsis The functions prefixed with Mmeas make up the Measurement module. The Measurement module allows you to find markers (for example, edges) in an image, based on differences in pixel intensities. Upon finding a marker, the module returns the marker's spatial reference position and measures features such as its width and angle. You can calculate measurements between two markers, such as the equation of the line that joins them. You can also use the Measurement module to specify explicit points, which you can use as a reference position. The Measurement module can operate on 8-bit or 16-bit unsigned grayscale images. Measurements are made and results are returned with subpixel accuracy.

Syntax MIL_ID MmeasAllocContext( MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*ContextIdPtr //out ) Description This function allocates a measurement context on the specified system. MIL uses a measurement context to control the behavior of measurement operations (MmeasFindMarker() and MmeasCalculate()). You can modify the settings of a measurement context with MmeasControl(). MIL allows you to specify M_DEFAULT as the identifier of the measurement context, when using MmeasFindMarker(), MmeasCalculate(), and MmeasInquire(); therefore, you need not call MmeasAllocContext(). However, you cannot specify M_DEFAULT as the identifier of the measurement context if want to modify it using MmeasControl(); to modify a measurement context, you must actually allocate it using MmeasAllocContext(). When the measurement context is no longer required, release it using MmeasFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during allocation; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the measurement context's lifetime and you must not manually free it. Parameters Parameters SysId Specifies the system on which the to allocate the measurement context. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the system identifier Value Description M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. ContextIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the measurement context identifier or specifies the data type that the function should use to return the measurement context identifier. For retrieving the identifier or specifying how to return it Value Description M_NULL Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated measurement context ; in this case, a standard MIL identifier of type MIL_ID is returned. M_UNIQUE_ID Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated measurement context ; in this case, a MIL smart identifier of type MIL_UNIQUE_MEAS_ID is returned instead of a standard MIL identifier. This setting is only available when using C++11 (or later). A MIL smart identifier manages the lifespan of the MIL object it owns (similar to a std::unique_ptr). Note, you can use a MIL smart identifier as though it were a standard MIL identifier, except that you cannot use it to manually free the measurement context (it is freed automatically). For more information, see the MIL smart identifiers subsection of the MIL custom data types, void pointers, extensions, and portability functions section of Chapter 2: Building an application.

Syntax MIL_ID MmeasAllocMarker( MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;MarkerType, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*MarkerIdPtr //out ) Description This function allocates a measurement marker buffer on the specified system. You can allocate an edge, stripe, circle, or point marker buffer. Once allocated, you can specify a marker's essential characteristics using MmeasSetMarker(); for an edge, stripe, or circle marker, you can also specify score characteristics using MmeasSetScore(). For an edge, stripe, or circle marker, MIL uses both essential and score characteristics to find the marker in a target image when you call MmeasFindMarker(). You cannot search for a point marker; you must define it at a specific location with MmeasSetMarker(). A point marker is typically used as a reference position when taking measurements between two markers using MmeasCalculate(). By default, when you allocate a marker buffer, it defines a single-occurrence marker. However, using MmeasSetMarker() with M_NUMBER, you can define an edge, stripe, or point marker as a multiple-occurrence marker. For edge and stripe markers, this allows you to search for multiple instances of the same image characteristics. For point markers, this allows you to define equidistant reference positions. You cannot define a multiple-occurrence circle marker. When the measurement marker buffer is no longer required, release it using MmeasFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during allocation; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the measurement marker buffer's lifetime and you must not manually free it. Parameters Parameters SysId Specifies the system on which to allocate the marker buffer. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the system identifier Value Description M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). MarkerType Specifies the type of marker buffer to allocate. This parameter must be set to one of the values below. For specifying the type of marker buffer to allocate Value Description M_CIRCLE Specifies a circle marker buffer. M_EDGE Specifies an edge marker buffer. M_POINT Specifies a point marker buffer. M_STRIPE Specifies a stripe marker buffer. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. MarkerIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the measurement marker buffer identifier or specifies the data type that the function should use to return the measurement marker buffer identifier. For retrieving the identifier or specifying how to return it Value Description M_NULL Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated measurement marker buffer ; in this case, a standard MIL identifier of type MIL_ID is returned. M_UNIQUE_ID Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated measurement marker buffer ; in this case, a MIL smart identifier of type MIL_UNIQUE_MEAS_ID is returned instead of a standard MIL identifier. This setting is only available when using C++11 (or later). A MIL smart identifier manages the lifespan of the MIL object it owns (similar to a std::unique_ptr).

Syntax void MmeasCalculate( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;Marker1Id, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;Marker2Id, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;MeasResultId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;MeasurementList //in ) Description This function calculates the specified measurements between the two specified markers. Before using an edge, stripe, or circle marker with this function, it must have been previously found in a target image (MmeasFindMarker()). Before using a point marker, its position must have been previously set (MmeasSetMarker()). The settings of the specified measurement context control the behavior of this function; to adjust these settings, use MmeasControl(). MIL stores the results of an MmeasCalculate() operation in the specified measurement result buffer; to obtain the results, use MmeasGetResult() or MmeasGetResultSingle(). If the markers were found in a calibrated image, you can specify the output units using MmeasControl() with M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS. MIL calculates the specified measurements according to the line joining the reference position of each marker (Marker1Id and Marker2Id). For edge, stripe, and circle markers, the default reference position corresponds to the marker's found position. For an edge marker, the default reference position is the X- and Y-coordinates of the edge's maximum edgevalue. For a stripe marker, the default reference position is the center of the center line that is fit between the stripe's two outer edges. For a circle marker, the default reference position is the X- and Y-coordinates of the circle's center. For a point marker, the default reference position is the same as the position specified using MmeasSetMarker() with M_POSITION. To change the reference position of any marker, use MmeasSetMarker() with M_MARKER_REFERENCE. Modifying the reference position only affects calculations between two markers (MmeasCalculate()); it does not, for example, affect how MIL locates or returns the position of markers (MmeasFindMarker()). If you specify multiple-occurrence markers, MIL performs its calculations using the occurrences of the first marker and the corresponding occurrences of the second marker. MIL limits the number of calculations to the smallest number of occurrences held in either marker. For example, if a marker contains one edge occurrence, MIL only performs one calculation, regardless of the number of edge occurrences in the other marker. Parameters Parameters ContextId Specifies the measurement context to use. For specifying the measurement context Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default measurement context of the current MIL application. Measurement context ID Specifies a valid measurement context, allocated using MmeasAllocContext(). Marker1Id Specifies the identifier of the first marker buffer to use for calculating measurements. Marker2Id Specifies the identifier of the second marker buffer to use for calculating measurements. MeasResultId Specifies the identifier of the result buffer in which to place results. MeasurementList Specifies which measurement(s) to calculate. This parameter must be set to one of the following values. To calculate more than one measurement, add the values together (for example, M_DISTANCE + M_ANGLE). For specifying which measurement(s) to calculate Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_ANGLE + M_DISTANCE + M_LINE_EQUATION. M_ANGLE Calculates the angle of the line joining both markers, relative to the positive X-axis. The resulting angle can be any value between 0° and 360°. M_DISTANCE Calculates the distance of the line joining both markers. M_LINE_EQUATION Calculates the equation of the line joining both markers. Compilation information Header Include mil.h.

Syntax void MmeasControl( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextOrResultId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlType, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;ControlValue //in ) Description This function allows you to control a measurement context or result buffer setting. These settings control the behavior of measurement operations (MmeasFindMarker() and MmeasCalculate()), which subsequently affects the results that you obtain (MmeasGetResult() or MmeasGetResultSingle()) or draw (MmeasDraw()). Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler) in 64-bit mode, MmeasControl() internally calls the MIL_DOUBLE version of this function (MmeasControlDouble()). If you need to pass large integer values (including pointers), call the MIL_INT64 version of this function (MmeasControlInt64()). Parameters Parameters ContextOrResultId Specifies the identifier of the measurement context or result buffer. For specifying the measurement context or result buffer identifier Value Description Measurement context ID Specifies a valid measurement context, previously allocated using MmeasAllocContext(). Measurement result buffer ID Specifies a valid measurement result buffer, previously allocated using MmeasAllocResult(). ControlType Specifies the type of control to set. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ControlValue Specifies the required value for the control. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Parameter associations The tables below list possible values for the ControlType and ControlValue parameters. For a measurement context For a measurement result buffer The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be specified for a measurement context. In this case, you must set the ContextOrResultId parameter to a measurement context. For a measurement context ControlType Description ControlValue M_PIXEL_ASPECT_RATIO Sets the pixel width to pixel height ratio. Value Specifies the ratio. The default value is 1.0. M_PIXEL_ASPECT_RATIO_INPUT Sets whether to use M_PIXEL_ASPECT_RATIO to correct measurement inputs. M_CORRECTED Specifies to correct measurement inputs with the specified aspect ratio. This is the default value. M_NORMAL Specifies to not correct measurement inputs (ratio of 1.0). M_PIXEL_ASPECT_RATIO_OUTPUT Sets whether to use M_PIXEL_ASPECT_RATIO to correct measurement results (output data). M_CORRECTED Specifies to correct measurement results with the specified aspect ratio. This is the default value. M_NORMAL Specifies to not correct measurement results (ratio of 1.0). The following ControlType and corresponding ControlValue parameter settings can be specified for a measurement result buffer. In this case, you must set the ContextOrResultId parameter to a measurement result buffer. For a measurement result buffer ControlType Description ControlValue M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS Sets whether to return results of MmeasCalculate() in pixels or world units. This essentially sets the output coordinate system to use. The setting of this control type will only affect functions within this module which return positional results. This control type can be changed at any time to return results in the required output units. Use MmeasSetMarker() with M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS to control the units in which results found using MmeasFindMarker() are returned. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ACCORDING_TO_CALIBRATION. M_ACCORDING_TO_CALIBRATION Specifies that results are returned in world units if the result was calculated on an image associated with a camera calibration context; otherwise, specifies that results are returned in pixel units. M_PIXEL Specifies that results are returned in pixel units, with respect to the pixel coordinate system. M_WORLD Specifies that results are returned in world units, with respect to the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, calling MmeasGetResult() or MmeasGetResultSingle() generates an error if the result was not calculated on a calibrated image.

This function can also perform the specified drawing operation on the result of a measurement calculation between two markers (MmeasCalculate()). This function can execute multiple drawing operations simultaneously (for example, M_DRAW_SEARCH_REGION + M_DRAW_SEARCH_DIRECTION). MIL performs the drawing operations in the specified destination image buffer or 2D graphics list. You can draw settings and results, obtained relative to an offset, at the top-left corner of the destination image, using MgraControl() with M_DRAW_OFFSET_X and M_DRAW_OFFSET_Y, and zoom them using MgraControl() with M_DRAW_ZOOM_X and M_DRAW_ZOOM_Y. For more information, see the Drawing graphics with offset and zoom subsection of the Drawing graphics section of Chapter 26: Generating graphics. Note that you can draw characteristics specified or returned in world units (MmeasSetMarker() with M_INCLUSION_POINT_INPUT_UNITS, M_MARKER_REFERENCE_INPUT_UNITS, M_POINT_INPUT_UNITS, M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS, and/or M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS set to M_WORLD). However, if you set any of these constants to M_WORLD and you specify to draw expected marker characteristics from a measurement marker, you must pass MmeasDraw() a calibrated target image. Otherwise, the function will generate an error. Parameters Parameters ContextGraId Specifies the 2D graphics context to use. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For specifying the 2D graphics context Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies that the default 2D graphics context of the current MIL application is used. Note that there is a different default 2D graphics context for each thread. MIL 2D graphics context identifier Specifies a valid 2D graphics context identifier, which you have allocated using MgraAlloc(). MarkerOrResultMeasId Specifies the identifier of a measurement marker buffer or the identifier of a measurement result buffer. A measurement marker buffer contains both the expected marker characteristics that you specified with MmeasSetMarker(), and the actual marker characteristics that MIL found in the target image with MmeasFindMarker(). To specify which characteristics to draw (expected or found), use the ControlFlag parameter (M_MARKER or M_RESULT). If you specify a measurement result buffer, it must contain results from MmeasCalculate(). DstImageBufOrListGraId Specifies the identifier of the destination image buffer or 2D graphics list in which to draw. The buffer can be any valid MIL image buffer allocated using MbufAlloc...(). The 2D graphics list must be previously allocated using MgraAllocList(). By drawing into a display's overlay buffer or associating the 2D graphics list with the display, you can also annotate an image non-destructively. If specifying an image buffer, it must not have a region of interest (ROI) associated with it. Using an image buffer with an ROI will cause an error. Operation Specifies the type of operation to perform. You can add the possible Operation parameter values in the tables below to draw multiple characteristics at once. The following operations are available when using a measurement marker buffer (MarkerOrResultMeasId) with either M_MARKER or M_RESULT (ControlFlag), unless otherwise specified. For measurement marker buffers with either M_MARKER or M_RESULT Value Description M_DRAW_INCLUSION_POINT Draws a cross (+) at the position of the marker's inclusion point. This applies to stripe markers. To specify an inclusion point, use MmeasSetMarker() with M_INCLUSION_POINT. M_DRAW_INCLUSION_POINT is only available with M_MARKER. M_DRAW_POSITION Draws a cross (+) at the position of the marker, for each marker occurrence. This applies to edge, stripe, circle, and point markers. For edge, stripe, and circle markers, the found position is drawn (MmeasFindMarker()); you must specify M_RESULT. For point markers, the defined position is drawn (MmeasSetMarker() with M_POSITION), although you can specify either M_MARKER or M_RESULT. M_DRAW_SEARCH_DIRECTION Draws an arrow starting from the middle of the marker's box search region and pointing towards the direction of the edge transition. This applies to edge and stripe markers; in this case, the search direction is based on the marker's orientation (MmeasSetMarker() with M_ORIENTATION). M_DRAW_SEARCH_REGION Draws the marker's search region. This applies to edge, stripe, and circle markers. M_DRAW_SEARCH_REGION_CENTER Draws the center of the marker's search region. This applies to edge, stripe, and circle markers. The following operations are available when using a measurement marker buffer (MarkerOrResultMeasId) with M_RESULT (ControlFlag). For measurement marker buffers and M_RESULT Value Description M_DRAW_EDGES Draws a line along the found edges of the marker. This applies to edge, stripe, and circle markers. For circle markers, the fitted circle is drawn, along with the found radius and position. M_DRAW_EDGES_PROFILE Draws the first derivative of the intensity profile (edgevalue) from which the marker was established. This applies to edge and stripe markers. If you are drawing in a 2D graphics list, you must add M_DRAW_IN_BOX to this operation. M_DRAW_EDGEVALUE_MIN_IN_PROFILE Draws the threshold above which a grayscale variation (edgevalue) can be considered an edge. This is a graphical representation of MmeasSetMarker() with M_EDGEVALUE_MIN. This applies to edge and stripe markers. If you are drawing in a 2D graphics list, you must add M_DRAW_IN_BOX to this operation. M_DRAW_EDGEVALUE_PEAK_WIDTH_IN_PROFILE Draws a horizontal line, beginning and ending with arrows (for example, &lt;---&gt;), to indicate the width of the edge peak of an edge or stripe marker. This is a graphical representation of MmeasGetResult() with M_EDGEVALUE_PEAK_WIDTH. This applies to edge and stripe markers. For stripe markers, the width of both its outermost edges is drawn, unless you specify M_EDGE_FIRST or M_EDGE_SECOND. If you are drawing in a 2D graphics list, you must add M_DRAW_IN_BOX to this operation. M_DRAW_POSITION_IN_PROFILE Draws a vertical bar at the position of the marker within its profile. This applies to edge and stripe markers. If you are drawing in a 2D graphics list, you must add M_DRAW_IN_BOX to this operation. M_DRAW_SPACING Draws an H-type line (|-|) indicating the found spacing. This applies to multiple-occurrence markers (edge and stripe). M_DRAW_SUB_POSITIONS Draws a cross (+) at the found positions of the subedges. This applies to edge, stripe, and circle markers. M_DRAW_WIDTH Draws an H-type line (|-|) to indicate the width of the edge peak of an edge or stripe marker. This is a graphical representation of MmeasGetResult() with M_EDGE_WIDTH. This applies to stripe markers only. Combination value for M_DRAW_EDGES_PROFILE , M_DRAW_EDGEVALUE_MIN_IN_PROFILE , M_DRAW_EDGEVALUE_PEAK_WIDTH_IN_PROFILE , M_DRAW_POSITION_IN_PROFILE. You can add the following value to the above-mentioned values to specify whether to scale down (resize) the drawing to fit within the dimensions of the box search region. For scaling down the specified drawing (edge and stripe markers only) Combination value Description M_DRAW_IN_BOX Performs the specified drawing operation (for example, M_DRAW_EDGES_PROFILE), except scaled down (resized) to fit within the dimensions of the box search region. If you do not use this combination value, the same drawing operation is performed (for example, the edge profile is drawn), but sized to fit the dimensions of the destination image buffer. Combination values for M_DRAW_POSITION , M_DRAW_EDGEVALUE_PEAK_WIDTH_IN_PROFILE , M_DRAW_SUB_POSITIONS. You can add one or more of the following values to the above-mentioned values to specify whether to perform the drawing operation on the first or second edge of a stripe. For specifying the edge for which to perform the drawing (stripe markers only) Combination value Description M_EDGE_FIRST Draws the specified characteristic for the first outermost edge of a stripe. The first edge of a stripe is the edge closest to the search region's origin. M_EDGE_SECOND Draws the specified characteristic for the second outermost edge of a stripe. The following operation is available when using a measurement result buffer (MarkerOrResultMeasId). For measurement result buffers and M_RESULT Value Description M_DRAW_LINE Draws the line that joins the two markers specified with MmeasCalculate(). Index Specifies the index of the result to draw from a measurement marker buffer or from a measurement result buffer. When drawing the expected characteristics of a marker (M_MARKER), MIL does not need any index information and you must set this parameter to M_DEFAULT. This parameter must be set to one of the values below. For specifying the index Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_RESULT_ALL_OCCURRENCES, when drawing the results of a measurement marker buffer or a measurement result buffer. When drawing the expected characteristics of a marker, this parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT, which specifies that the index information is not needed. Note that when drawing the expected characteristics of a marker that is actually a multiple-occurrence marker, only the first instance of the marker is drawn.

      "text": " MmeasFindMarker Synopsis Find a marker in a target image and take the specified measurements. Syntax void MmeasFindMarker( MIL_ID&nbsp;ContextId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;ImageBufId, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;MarkerId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;MeasurementList //in ) Description This function finds an edge, stripe, or circle marker in the specified target image and takes the specified measurements. To locate the marker, MIL uses its essential characteristics (MmeasSetMarker()), its score characteristics (MmeasSetScore()), and the measurement context (MmeasControl()). For edge and stripe markers, it is recommended that the box search region be set to an angle close to that of the required marker (that is, within the marker's particular rotation tolerance) to ensure that the marker is found and that results are accurate. The greater the angle of the marker relative to the search region, the greater the distortion of the marker's actual characteristics, which increases the chance that MmeasFindMarker() might not successfully locate the marker. MmeasFindMarker() stores its results in the specified measurement marker (not in a result buffer). To obtain results, use MmeasGetResultSingle() or MmeasGetResult(). All positional results are relative to the top-left pixel in the target image, or the origin of the relative coordinate system if the target is a calibrated image. If you have associated the target image with a camera calibration context, you can specify that certain input settings be interpreted in world units. To do so, use MmeasSetMarker() with M_MARKER_REFERENCE_INPUT_UNITS, M_INCLUSION_POINT_INPUT_UNITS, and/or M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS set to M_WORLD. By using a calibrated image, you can specify the search region according to the relative coordinate system using MmeasSetMarker(), and then fixture the relative coordinate system to each object. This way, you will only need to place the search region once, and all of the search results will be made from the same reference location. Note that if you set any of these constants to M_WORLD but you don't pass MmeasFindMarker() a calibrated target image, the function will generate an error. For edge and stripe markers, you can limit the find operation to a region of the target image buffer using a rectangular region of interest (ROI) set with MbufSetRegion(). For circle markers, you can limit the find operation to a region of the target image buffer using a circular region of interest (ROI) set with MbufSetRegion(). The find marker operation will then search inside the ROI instead of inside any previously set search regions. Note that while the region of interest (ROI) affects the marker occurrences, it will not change the settings of any previously set search regions. In these cases, the region must be defined in vector format from a 2D graphics list (M_VECTOR or M_VECTOR_AND_RASTER). An error will be generated if the ROI is only in raster format (M_RASTER). When finding an edge or stripe marker, the target image buffer can have a rectangular region of interest (ROI), defined using MbufSetRegion() (with or without rotation). When finding a circle marker, the target image buffer can have a circular region of interest (ROI), defined using MbufSetRegion(). Parameters Parameters ContextId Specifies the identifier of the measurement context. For specifying the measurement context identifier Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default measurement context of the current MIL application. Measurement context ID Specifies a valid measurement context, previously allocated using MmeasAllocContext(). ImageBufId Specifies the identifier of the target image buffer in which to locate the marker. This buffer must be a 1-band, 8-bit or 16-bit unsigned image buffer. MarkerId Specifies the identifier of the marker to be located in the image. MeasurementList Specifies the measurements to perform. MIL considers the specified measurements when establishing results (MmeasGetResult() or MmeasGetResultSingle()). If you do not specify M_DEFAULT, which takes all possible measurements applicable to the marker type, you might not be able to retrieve all results for that marker. For the vast majority of applications, M_DEFAULT should be set. Note that if you did not specify multiple subregions (MmeasSetMarker() with M_SUB_REGIONS_NUMBER), MIL will internally use three to perform certain measurements, such as determining the equation of a line (M_LINE_EQUATION). To ensure that MIL does not internally use multiple subregions when you did not specify any, you must not select measurements that require them. Except for M_DEFAULT, you can add measurement list values together (for example, M_POSITION + M_ANGLE + M_LENGTH). The measurements in the following table can be performed with edge, stripe, or circle markers. For specifying the measurements to perform when using edge, stripe, or circle markers Value Description M_DEFAULT Performs all measurements that apply to the marker type. For example, if you are using a circle, MIL takes all measurements possible for circle markers. M_POSITION Determines the position of the marker. By specifying M_POSITION, all of the following will also be accessible with MmeasGetResult() or MmeasGetResultSingle() (for edge and stripe markers): M_BOX_EDGEVALUES, M_EDGE_END, M_EDGE_STRENGTH, M_EDGE_START, M_ORIENTATION, M_EDGEVALUE_PEAK_POS_MAX, M_EDGEVALUE_PEAK_POS_MIN, and M_SPACING. Combination values that can be used alone or as combination values for M_POSITION. You can use one or more of the following values in combination with each other or with the above-mentioned value, to specify the measurement to perform when using edge or stripe markers. The measurements in the following table can be performed with edge or stripe markers, unless otherwise specified. For specifying the measurements to perform when using edge or stripe markers Value Description M_ANGLE Determines the angle of the mean line of a marker, relative to the output coordinate system specified using MmeasControl() with M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS. The angle can result in a value between 0° and 360°. For a stripe marker, MIL establishes the angle of three lines: the stripe's mean line, the stripe's first outermost edge, and the stripe's second outermost edge. An angle interpreted with respect to the pixel coordinate system is always measured counter-clockwise. For information on the angle's direction of rotation when interpreting the angle with respect to the relative coordinate system, see the Angle convention in MIL subsection of the Working with real-world units section of Chapter 28: Calibrating your camera setup. If you did not explicitly specify multiple subregions (MmeasSetMarker() with M_SUB_REGIONS_NUMBER), MIL will internally use three to establish the lines it requires to determine M_ANGLE. M_EDGE_CONTRAST Determines the grayscale difference between the start (M_EDGE_START) and end (M_EDGE_END) of the intensity transition from which the edge is established. For a stripe marker, MIL establishes this value from the stripe's first and second outermost edges. M_EDGE_INSIDE Determines the number of edges located between the two exterior edges of a stripe. This only applies to stripe markers. M_EDGE_WIDTH Determines the distance between the start (M_EDGE_START) and end (M_EDGE_END) of the intensity transition from which the edge is established. For a stripe marker, MIL establishes this value for the stripe's first and second outermost edges. M_EDGEVALUE_PEAK_CONTRAST Determines the grayscale difference of the intensity transition between the first zero edgevalues on both sides of the edge peak (before M_EDGEVALUE_PEAK_POS_MIN, and after M_EDGEVALUE_PEAK_POS_MAX). For a stripe marker, MIL establishes this value for the stripe's first and second outermost edges. Note that some images might never have a zero edgevalue, in which case you should use M_EDGE_CONTRAST for a more meaningful result. M_EDGEVALUE_PEAK_WIDTH Determines the distance between the minimum (M_EDGEVALUE_PEAK_POS_MIN) and maximum (M_EDGEVALUE_PEAK_POS_MAX) positions of the edge peak (that is, the minimum and maximum position of the edgevalue along the first derivative representation of the intensity). For a stripe marker, MIL establishes this value for the stripe's first and second outermost edges. M_LENGTH Determines the length of the side of the marker perpendicular to the search direction. This is useful to retrieve the number of pixels that were projected into a single value of the intensity profile without having to find M_ORIENTATION first. M_LINE_END_POINT_FIRST Determines the X- and Y-coordinates of the first intersection point between the marker's mean line and the box search region. For a stripe marker, the mean line is the mean of the lines following its two edges. If you did not specify multiple subregions (MmeasSetMarker() with M_SUB_REGIONS_NUMBER), MIL will internally use three to establish the line it requires to determine M_LINE_END_POINT_FIRST. M_LINE_END_POINT_SECOND Determines the X- and Y-coordinates of the second intersection point between the marker's mean line and the box search region. For a stripe marker, the mean line is the mean of the lines following its two edges. If you did not specify multiple subregions (MmeasSetMarker() with M_SUB_REGIONS_NUMBER), MIL will internally use three to establish the line it requires to determine M_LINE_END_POINT_SECOND. M_LINE_EQUATION Determines the equation of the line following an edge. The line equation is of the general form, Ax + By + C = 0. For a stripe marker, MIL establishes the equation of three lines: the stripe's mean line, the stripe's first edge, and the stripe's second edges. If you did not specify multiple subregions (MmeasSetMarker() with M_SUB_REGIONS_NUMBER), MIL will internally use three to establish the lines it requires to determine M_LINE_EQUATION. M_POLARITY Determines whether the edge(s) are rising (positive polarity) or falling (negative polarity). M_STRIPE_WIDTH Determines the width of the stripe marker. The stripe's width refers to the distance between the position of the maximum edgevalue of the stripe's two outermost edges. This only applies to stripe markers. Combination value that can be used alone or as combination value for M_POSITION. You can use the following value on its own, or add it to the above-mentioned value, to specify the measurement to perform when using circle markers. For specifying the measurement to perform when using circle markers Value Description M_RADIUS Determines the distance between the circle's circumference and the circle's center.

Syntax void MmeasGetResult( MIL_ID&nbsp;MarkerOrMeasResultId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ResultType, //in void&nbsp;*FirstResultArrayPtr, //out void&nbsp;*SecondResultArrayPtr //out ) Description This function retrieves the result(s) of the specified type for all points, edges, stripes, or circles from a measurement marker buffer or a measurement result buffer. Measurement marker buffers hold the results of an MmeasFindMarker() operation, while measurement result buffers hold the results of an MmeasCalculate() operation. Depending on the buffer you are using, you must call either MmeasFindMarker() or MmeasCalculate() prior to calling MmeasGetResult(); otherwise, you will get incorrect results. If you are using a multiple-occurrence marker, MmeasGetResult() typically returns the specified result for all occurrences. The result for the marker's first occurrence will be followed by the result for the marker's second occurrence, and so on. To return results for a single occurrence, use MmeasGetResultSingle(). Note that some results cannot be returned for each occurrence since they are based on the marker itself (for example, M_BOX_ANGLE_FOUND, which returns the angle of the marker's box search region); in such cases, you will get a single result, even if you are using a multiple-occurrence marker. If your target image was associated with a camera calibration context, positional and dimensional results are, by default, returned with respect to the relative coordinate system of the image. Otherwise, these results are returned in pixels, relative to the top-left pixel in the target image. If your target image was associated with a camera calibration context and you want to retrieve positional and dimensional results in pixel units, use MmeasSetMarker() for a measurement marker buffer, or MmeasControl() for a measurement result buffer, with M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS set to M_PIXEL. If you set M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS to M_WORLD without specifying a calibrated image in which to calculate the results, MmeasGetResult() will generate an error. For certain result types, MIL returns one value for an edge marker, and two values for a stripe marker. In these cases, for an edge marker, MIL returns all results to FirstResultArrayPtr; SecondResultArrayPtr must be set to M_NULL. When retrieving a result for a stripe marker, result types can return one general result for the stripe, a result for both edges of the stripe, or a result for one edge of the stripe. To return the result for one edge of the stripe, you must specify the edge using the combination value M_EDGE_FIRST or M_EDGE_SECOND. When retrieving non-positional results for both edges of a stripe marker, MIL returns the results for the first edge to FirstResultArrayPtr and for the second edge to SecondResultArrayPtr. When retrieving non-positional results for one edge of the stripe, MIL always returns the result to FirstResultArrayPtr. When retrieving positional results for a stripe, MIL returns the results for the X-coordinate of the stripe to FirstResultArrayPtr and the Y-coordinate of the stripe to SecondResultArrayPtr. When retrieving positional results for one edge of the stripe, MIL returns the X-coordinate to FirstResultArrayPtr and the Y-coordinate to SecondResultArrayPtr. You can set FirstResultArrayPtr or SecondResultArrayPtr to M_NULL to retrieve only one coordinate. Parameters Parameters MarkerOrMeasResultId Specifies the identifier of the measurement marker buffer (allocated with MmeasAllocMarker()) or measurement result buffer (allocated with MmeasAllocResult()) from which to retrieve results. ResultType Specifies the type of result(s) to retrieve. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. FirstResultArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] array of type MIL_INT32 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT32&gt; ] array of type MIL_INT64 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT64&gt; ] MIL_DOUBLE MIL_INT MIL_INT32 MIL_INT64 Specifies the address of the first array in which to write the requested information. With a multiple-occurrence marker, the results for each occurrence of the marker will be stored in a separate element of the specified arrays. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be returned. SecondResultArrayPtr Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): array of type MIL_DOUBLE [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_DOUBLE&gt; ] array of type MIL_INT [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT&gt; ] array of type MIL_INT32 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT32&gt; ] array of type MIL_INT64 [optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector&lt;MIL_INT64&gt; ] M_NULL MIL_DOUBLE MIL_INT MIL_INT32 MIL_INT64 Specifies the address of the second array in which to write the requested information. For most result types, only FirstResultArrayPtr will be used, and SecondResultArrayPtr should be set to M_NULL. With a multiple-occurrence marker, results for each edge or stripe are held in an array. The results for each occurrence of the marker will be stored in a separate element of the specified arrays. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be returned. Parameter associations The tables below list possible values for the ResultType parameter and possible values returned to the FirstResultArrayPtr and SecondResultArrayPtr parameters. For any type of marker (measurement marker buffer) or a measurement result buffer For an edge or stripe marker (measurement marker buffer) or a measurement result buffer For any type of marker (measurement marker buffer) For an edge, stripe, or circle marker (measurement marker buffer) For an edge or stripe marker (measurement marker buffer) For a circle marker (measurement marker buffer) For a measurement result buffer To retrieve results from any type of marker (measurement marker buffer), or from a measurement result buffer, ResultType can be set to one of the values specified in the table below. For any type of marker (measurement marker buffer) or a measurement result buffer ResultType Description FirstResultArrayPtr - Possible values returned SecondResultArrayPtr - Possible values returned M_NUMBER Retrieves the number of points, edges, stripes, or circles measured. Note that edges, stripes, and circles are searched for, but points are placed manually. For circle markers, M_NUMBER will never return a value greater than one, since circles cannot be defined as a multiple-occurrence marker. If you are getting results from a measurement result buffer, and you are using two multiple-occurrence markers that have a different number of occurrences, MIL uses the fewest number of occurrences to calculate results (MmeasCalculate()). After a call to the MmeasFindMarker() function, this number is equal to the number of occurrences of a marker found in the search region. After a call to the MmeasCalculate() function, this number is equal to the smallest number of occurrences held in either marker involved in the calculation. Note that this result type always returns one value, even when using a multiple-occurrence marker, and there are multiple occurrences.

For an edge or stripe marker (measurement marker buffer) or a measurement result buffer ResultType Description FirstResultArrayPtr - Possible values returned SecondResultArrayPtr - Possible values returned M_ANGLE Retrieves the angle for each marker occurrence, in degrees. The angle is relative to the output coordinate system specified using M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS with either MmeasSetMarker() (for a measurement marker buffer) or MmeasControl() (for a measurement result buffer). If retrieved from a measurement marker buffer, M_ANGLE returns the angle of the line measured for the edge. For a stripe marker, this line follows the center of the stripe and is calculated as the mean of the lines following its edges. If the result is requested for a specific edge of the stripe, using the combination value M_EDGE_FIRST or M_EDGE_SECOND, the angle of the first or second edge is returned, respectively. If retrieved from a measurement result buffer, M_ANGLE returns the angle of the lines joining each of the occurrences of the two markers, relative to the positive X-axis. An angle interpreted with respect to the pixel coordinate system is always measured counter-clockwise. For information on the angle's direction of rotation when interpreting the angle with respect to the relative coordinate system, see the Angle convention in MIL subsection of the Working with real-world units section of Chapter 28: Calibrating your camera setup.

For edge markers, the position refers to the X- and Y-coordinates of the edge's maximum edgevalue (highest edge peak) along the center of the search region. For stripe markers, the position refers to the X- and Y-coordinates at the center of a theoretical line between the position (maximum edgevalue) of the stripe's two outermost edges.

Syntax void MmeasGetResultSingle( MIL_ID&nbsp;MarkerOrMeasResultId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ResultType, //in void&nbsp;*FirstResultArrayPtr, //out void&nbsp;*SecondResultArrayPtr, //out MIL_INT&nbsp;ResultIndex //in ) Description This function retrieves the specified result of the specified type for a point, edge, stripe, or circle from a measurement marker buffer or a measurement result buffer. Measurement marker buffers hold the results of an MmeasFindMarker() operation, while measurement result buffers hold the results of an MmeasCalculate() operation. Depending on the buffer you are using, you must call either MmeasFindMarker() or MmeasCalculate() prior to calling MmeasGetResult(); otherwise, you will get an incorrect result. If you are using a multiple-occurrence marker, MmeasGetResultSingle() returns the specified result for a single occurrence, which you must specify with the ResultIndex parameter. To return results for all occurrences, use MmeasGetResult(). If your target image was associated with a camera calibration context, positional and dimensional results are, by default, returned with respect to the relative coordinate system of the image. Otherwise, these results are returned in pixels, relative to the top-left pixel in the target image. If your target image was associated with a camera calibration context and you want to retrieve positional and dimensional results in pixel units, use MmeasSetMarker() for a measurement marker buffer, or MmeasControl() for a measurement result buffer, with M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS set to M_PIXEL. If you set M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS to M_WORLD without specifying a calibrated image in which to calculate the results, MmeasGetResultSingle() will generate an error. For certain result types, MIL returns one value for an edge marker, and two values for a stripe marker. In these cases, for an edge marker, MIL returns the result to FirstResultArrayPtr; SecondResultArrayPtr must be set to M_NULL. When retrieving a result for a stripe marker, result types can return one general result for the stripe, a result for both edges of the stripe, or a result for one edge of the stripe. To return the result for one edge of the stripe, you must specify the edge using the combination value M_EDGE_FIRST or M_EDGE_SECOND. When retrieving non-positional results for both edges of a stripe marker, MIL returns the results for the first edge to FirstResultArrayPtr and for the second edge to SecondResultArrayPtr. When retrieving non-positional results for one edge of the stripe, MIL always returns the result to FirstResultArrayPtr. When retrieving positional results for a stripe, MIL returns the results for the X-coordinate of the stripe to FirstResultArrayPtr and the Y-coordinate of the stripe to SecondResultArrayPtr. When retrieving positional results for one edge of the stripe, MIL returns the X-coordinate to FirstResultArrayPtr and the Y-coordinate to SecondResultArrayPtr. You can set FirstResultArrayPtr or SecondResultArrayPtr to M_NULL to retrieve only one coordinate. Parameters Parameters MarkerOrMeasResultId Specifies the identifier of the measurement marker (allocated with MmeasAllocMarker()) or measurement result buffer (allocated with MmeasAllocResult()) from which to retrieve results.

For any type of marker (measurement marker buffer) or a measurement result buffer For an edge or stripe marker (measurement marker buffer) or a measurement result buffer For any type marker (measurement marker buffer) For an edge, stripe, or circle marker (measurement marker buffer) For an edge or stripe marker (measurement marker buffer) For a circle marker (measurement marker buffer) For a measurement result buffer To retrieve a result from any type of marker (measurement marker buffer), or from a measurement result buffer, ResultType can be set to one of the values specified in the table below. If you are getting results from a measurement result buffer, and you are using two multiple-occurrence markers that have a different number of occurrences, MIL uses the fewest number of occurrences to calculate results (MmeasCalculate()). For any type of marker (measurement marker buffer) or a measurement result buffer ResultType Description FirstResultArrayPtr - Possible values returned SecondResultArrayPtr - Possible values returned M_NUMBER Retrieves the number of points, edges, stripes, or circles measured. Note that edges, stripes, and circles are searched for, but points are placed manually. For circle markers, M_NUMBER will never return a value greater than one, since circles cannot be defined as a multiple-occurrence marker. After a call to the MmeasFindMarker() function, this number is equal to the number of occurrences of a marker found in the search region. After a call to the MmeasCalculate() function, this number is equal to the smallest number of occurrences held in either marker involved in the calculation.

When using this function with M_RESULT, you will get the results of the score characteristic that MIL established in the target image after your last call to MmeasFindMarker(), as well as the value of the characteristic established by the find operation. When using this function with M_MARKER, you will get the values that you specified for the score characteristic's settings with your last call to MmeasSetScore(), as well as the value of the character specified in the marker. Before using this function with M_RESULT, you must first call MmeasFindMarker(). The information that you can retrieve for each score characteristic is based on its settings in MmeasSetScore(). If you try to get the results (M_RESULT) of a score characteristic that you did not set using MmeasSetScore(), you will receive an error. However, if you inquire (M_MARKER) about a score characteristic that you did not set, you will receive the default (initial) values of that characteristic, as indicated in MmeasSetScore(). If you have associated the target image with a camera calibration context (MmeasFindMarker()), you can specify that certain values be interpreted in world units. To do so, you must have used MmeasSetScore() with M_WORLD. Note that if you used M_WORLD but didn't use a calibrated target image, the function will generate an error.

Syntax MIL_ID MmeasRestoreMarker( MIL_CONST_TEXT_PTR&nbsp;FileName, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*MarkerIdPtr //out ) Description This function restores a marker that was previously saved, using MmeasSaveMarker() or MmeasStream(), and returns a handle to it. It also restores all the marker characteristics that were in effect when the marker was saved. When the restored marker is no longer required, release it using MmeasFree() unless M_UNIQUE_ID was specified during allocation; if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified, the smart identifier manages the restored marker's lifetime and you must not manually free it. Parameters Parameters FileName Specifies the name and path of the file from which to restore the marker. The function handles (internally) the opening and closing of the file. This parameter can be set to one of the following: For specifying the file name and path Value Description M_INTERACTIVE [This is only applicable to Windows] Opens the File Open dialog box from which you can interactively specify the drive, directory, and name of the file. MIL_TEXT(\"FileName\") 1 Specifies the drive, directory, and name of the file (for example, \"C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). Typically, marker files have an MRK extension. To specify a file on a remote computer (under Distributed MIL), prefix the specified file name string with \"remote:///\" (for example, \"remote:///C:\\mydirectory\\myfile\"). 1 If you are passing the value in a variable, don't enclose it in MIL_TEXT(). SysId Specifies the system on which to restore the measurement marker. This parameter should be set to one of the following values: For specifying the system identifier Value Description M_DEFAULT_HOST Specifies the default Host system of the current MIL application. MIL system identifier Specifies a valid system identifier, previously allocated using MsysAlloc(). ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion, and must be set to M_DEFAULT. MarkerIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the marker identifier or specifies the data type that the function should use to return the marker identifier. For retrieving the identifier or specifying how to return it Value Description M_NULL Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated measurement marker ; in this case, a standard MIL identifier of type MIL_ID is returned. M_UNIQUE_ID Specifies that you will use this function's return value to obtain the identifier of the allocated measurement marker ; in this case, a MIL smart identifier of type MIL_UNIQUE_MEAS_ID is returned instead of a standard MIL identifier. This setting is only available when using C++11 (or later). A MIL smart identifier manages the lifespan of the MIL object it owns (similar to a std::unique_ptr). Note, you can use a MIL smart identifier as though it were a standard MIL identifier, except that you cannot use it to manually free the measurement marker (it is freed automatically). For more information, see the MIL smart identifiers subsection of the MIL custom data types, void pointers, extensions, and portability functions section of Chapter 2: Building an application. Address in which to write the identifier Specifies the address of a MIL_ID in which to write the identifier of the restored marker. If restoration fails, M_NULL is written as the identifier. Return value The returned value is the marker identifier either as a standard identifier (MIL_ID) or a smart identifier (MIL_UNIQUE_MEAS_ID). If allocation fails, M_NULL is returned (or nullptr if M_UNIQUE_ID was specified). Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; milmeas.lib. DLL Requires mil.dll; milmeas.dll.

Syntax void MmeasSetMarker( MIL_ID&nbsp;MarkerId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;CharacteristicToSet, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;FirstValue, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;SecondValue //in ) Description This function sets an essential characteristic of a marker. Essential characteristics are used in determining the location of an edge, stripe, or circle marker in a target image, or specifying the position of point markers, which are generally used as a reference marker. MmeasFindMarker() locates the edges, stripes, or circle that best correspond to the specified marker's characteristics. A marker's characteristics should describe the marker as accurately as possible to ensure that it will be successfully located in an image. Note that when using a C compiler (not a C++ or other compiler) in 64-bit mode, MmeasSetMarker() internally calls the MIL_DOUBLE version of this function (MmeasSetMarkerDouble()). If you need to pass large integer values (including pointers), call the MIL_INT64 version of this function (MmeasSetMarkerInt64()). Parameters Parameters MarkerId Specifies the identifier of the marker. Markers need to be allocated using MmeasAllocMarker() before being set. CharacteristicToSet Specifies the type of characteristic to set. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. FirstValue Specifies the first value to assign to the characteristic. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. SecondValue Specifies the second value to assign to the characteristic. If only one value is to be returned, it will be returned to FirstValue and SecondValue should be set to M_NULL. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Parameter associations The tables below list possible values for the CharacteristicToSet, FirstValue, and SecondValue parameters. For M_POINT, M_EDGE, M_STRIPE, and M_CIRCLE markers For M_POINT, M_EDGE, and M_STRIPE markers For M_EDGE, M_STRIPE, and M_CIRCLE markers For M_EDGE and M_STRIPE markers For M_POINT markers For M_STRIPE markers For M_CIRCLE markers For M_POINT, M_EDGE, M_STRIPE, and M_CIRCLE markers, the CharacteristicToSet and corresponding FirstValue and SecondValue parameters can be set to the following. Note that the SecondValue parameter should be set to M_NULL if no parameter setting is required. For M_POINT, M_EDGE, M_STRIPE, and M_CIRCLE markers CharacteristicToSet Description FirstValue SecondValue M_MARKER_REFERENCE Sets the offset at which to place the marker's reference position, relative to the marker's actual position. The reference position is only used in calculations between two markers (MmeasCalculate()). For point markers, MIL measures the specified offset relative to the X- and Y-coordinates set for the point using M_POSITION. For edge markers, MIL measures the specified offset relative to the X- and Y-coordinates of the edge's maximum edgevalue. For stripe markers, MIL measures the specified offset relative to the X- and Y-coordinates at the center of a theoretical line between the position (maximum edgevalue) of the stripe's two outermost edges. For circle markers, MIL measures the specified offset relative to the X- and Y-coordinates at the circle's center. By default, the marker's reference position is the same as its actual position (the default offset is 0). FirstValue Specifies the X-offset at which to place the marker's reference position. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. Value Specifies the X-offset value, in the same units as the input coordinate system specified using M_MARKER_REFERENCE_INPUT_UNITS. SecondValue Specifies the Y-offset at which to place the marker's reference position. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. Value Specifies the Y-offset value, in the same units as the input coordinate system specified using M_MARKER_REFERENCE_INPUT_UNITS. M_MARKER_REFERENCE_INPUT_UNITS Sets the units with which to interpret M_MARKER_REFERENCE. This essentially sets the input coordinate system to use. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Same as M_PIXEL. M_PIXEL Specifies to interpret the value in pixel units, according to the pixel coordinate system. M_WORLD Specifies to interpret the value in world units, according to the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, calling MmeasDraw() to draw expected marker characteristics or MmeasFindMarker() generates an error if the operation is not performed on a calibrated image. M_RESULT_OUTPUT_UNITS Sets whether to return results in pixels or world units. This essentially sets the output coordinate system to use. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ACCORDING_TO_CALIBRATION. M_ACCORDING_TO_CALIBRATION Specifies that results are returned in world units if the result was calculated on an image associated with a camera calibration context; otherwise, specifies that results are returned in pixel units. M_PIXEL Specifies that results are returned in pixel units, according to the pixel coordinate system. M_WORLD Specifies that results are returned in world units, according to the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, calling MmeasGetResult() or MmeasGetResultSingle() generates an error if the result was not calculated on a calibrated image. For M_POINT, M_EDGE, and M_STRIPE markers, the CharacteristicToSet and corresponding FirstValue and SecondValue parameters can be set to the following. Note that the SecondValue parameter should be set to M_NULL if no parameter setting is required. For M_POINT, M_EDGE, and M_STRIPE markers CharacteristicToSet Description FirstValue SecondValue M_NUMBER Sets the number of edges or stripes to locate in the box search region, or the number of points to explicitly define (points are typically used as a reference marker). In the first case, this can be referred to as the number of marker occurrences. When M_NUMBER is set to a value greater than 1, the marker is considered a multiple-occurrence marker. Note that a circle marker cannot be set as a multiple-occurrence marker. For edges and stripes, unless a minimum number (M_NUMBER_MIN) is specified, no results will be returned if the number of marker occurrences found falls below M_NUMBER. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 1. M_ALL Specifies that the search should locate all edges or stripes in the box search region. This setting cannot be used for a point marker. If using M_ALL and M_NUMBER_MIN is set to M_DEFAULT, M_NUMBER_MIN is ignored and MIL will find as many marker occurrences as it can in the image. However, if M_NUMBER_MIN is set to a value other than M_DEFAULT, this value is respected and results are returned, provided that the specified minimum number of markers are found. Value Specifies the number of edges or stripes to locate, or point markers to define. For M_EDGE, M_STRIPE, and M_CIRCLE markers, the CharacteristicToSet and corresponding FirstValue and SecondValue parameters can be set to the following. Note that the SecondValue parameter should be set to M_NULL if no parameter setting is required. For M_EDGE, M_STRIPE, and M_CIRCLE markers CharacteristicToSet Description FirstValue SecondValue M_EDGEVALUE_MIN Sets the minimum edgevalue required for it to be considered an occurrence of the marker. MIL establishes edgevalues by taking the normalized first derivative of the intensity profile, which generally resembles a peak when an edge is present. When searching for multiple edges, you might need to further constrain the edgevalues that MIL considers, using M_EDGEVALUE_VAR_MIN. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 2.0. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the minimum edgevalue. A setting of 0.0 indicates that MIL considers all edgevalues, while a setting of 100.0 indicates that MIL only considers the greatest possible edgevalue. The greatest possible edgevalue results from a perfectly straight, perfectly white to perfectly black (or vice versa) grayscale transition over one pixel. If you set the minimum edgevalue to a very low value, MmeasFindMarker() can take longer to execute. M_EDGEVALUE_VAR_MIN Sets the minimum prominence required for an edge peak, for it to be considered an occurrence of the marker. To determine if the minimum prominence is met, MIL establishes a local threshold for each peak by subtracting M_EDGEVALUE_VAR_MIN from it. The portion of the profile above the local threshold that contains the edge peak can be referred to as the peak's interval, provided that the profile eventually dips below the local threshold on both sides of its edge peak. For MIL to consider a peak to be an edge, there must be no edgevalues greater than that peak within its interval. If the local threshold calculated with M_EDGEVALUE_VAR_MIN is less than M_EDGEVALUE_MIN, the local threshold equals M_EDGEVALUE_MIN. M_EDGEVALUE_VAR_MIN is typically used by advanced applications where you are trying to find multiple neighboring edges in the search region, which are formed such that the foreground of the first edge becomes the background of the next edge. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 100.0. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the minimum prominence. A setting of 0.0 indicates no prominence; that is, MIL only considers the maximum edgevalue of the peak's interval. A setting of 100.0 (default) indicates the greatest possible prominence; that is, MIL considers all edgevalues of the peak's interval that are above M_EDGEVALUE_MIN. In this case, M_EDGEVALUE_VAR_MIN has no effect. M_FILTER_SMOOTHNESS Sets the degree of smoothness (strength of denoising) applied to the internal projection buffer of the search region during the edge extraction. The recursive edge extraction process involves a denoising operation. Note that M_FILTER_SMOOTHNESS is only available if M_FILTER_TYPE is set to M_SHEN. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 50.0. 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the smoothness value. A value of 100.0 results in a strong noise reduction effect, while a value of 0.0 has almost no noise reduction effect. M_FILTER_TYPE Sets the type of the first derivative filter with which to perform the edge extraction. The edgevalue calculated for each projection value of the search region is dependent on this setting. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Same as M_EULER. M_EULER Specifies an Euler FIR filter. This filter performs a non-recursive edge extraction operation with a predefined kernel of size 2: [-1,1]. This filter is faster but more sensitive to noise, compared to M_PREWITT filter. M_PREWITT Specifies a Prewitt FIR filter. This filter performs a non-recursive edge extraction operation with a predefined kernel of size 3: [-1,0,1]. This filter is slower but less sensitive to noise, compared to M_EULER filter. M_SHEN Specifies a Shen-Castan Infinite Support Exponential filter. This is an exponential weighting function, of the general form: This filter performs a recursive edge extraction operation using an IIR filter. If this filter actually used a kernel, the kernel size would be theoretically infinite. This IIR filter is slower than FIR filters (M_EULER or M_PREWITT). However, this filter is less sensitive to noise and provides more accurate results. You can also control the strength of denoising applied to the projection buffer of the search region during the edge extraction, using the M_FILTER_SMOOTHNESS setting. M_MAX_ASSOCIATION_DISTANCE Sets the maximum distance between a marker's edge (either straight or circular) and its associated subedges. The subedges' positions are points extracted from the marker's subregions that are used during the fit operation. For edge and stripe markers, M_MAX_ASSOCIATION_DISTANCE is measured perpendicular from the fitted edge position, along to the search direction. For circle markers, M_MAX_ASSOCIATION_DISTANCE is measured radially from the fitted circle perimeter. Subedges falling outside the specified maximum distance are considered outliers and are not used to perform the marker's line or circle fit operation. For edge and stripe markers, this leads to fitted edges more in line with the marker orientation and, for circle markers, this ensures that the fitted circle will be fitted on subedges roughly at the same distance from the fitted circle center. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Same as M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE. M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE Specifies that there is no maximum distance; the entire search region is searched for subedges. Value Specifies the distance, in the units of the input coordinate system specified using M_MAX_ASSOCIATION_DISTANCE_INPUT_UNITS. M_MAX_ASSOCIATION_DISTANCE_INPUT_UNITS Sets the units with which to interpret M_MAX_ASSOCIATION_DISTANCE. This essentially sets the input coordinate system to use. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Same as M_PIXEL. M_PIXEL Specifies to interpret the value in pixel units, according to the pixel coordinate system. M_WORLD Specifies to interpret the value in world units, according to the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, calling MmeasDraw() to draw expected marker characteristics or MmeasFindMarker() generates an error if the operation is not performed on a calibrated image. M_POLARITY Specifies the polarity of the marker. Polarity indicates whether an edge must be a rising edge (increase in grayscale value) or a falling edge (decrease in grayscale value). FirstValue Specifies the polarity of the edge. For stripe markers, this is the polarity of the first edge. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ANY. M_ANY Specifies that polarity is not considered. M_NEGATIVE Specifies that the polarity of the edge is negative (falling edge). For circle markers, this indicates that the inside of the ring-shaped region has a greater grayscale value (falling edge from inside to outside). M_POSITIVE Specifies that the polarity of the edge is positive (rising edge). For circle markers, this indicates that the inside of the ring-shaped region has a lower grayscale value (rising edge from inside to outside). SecondValue Specifies the polarity of the second edge of a stripe. M_DEFAULT Same as M_OPPOSITE. M_NULL Specifies that this parameter does not apply. This setting must be used for edge and circle markers. M_ANY Specifies that the polarity is not considered. M_NEGATIVE Specifies that the polarity of the second edge is negative (falling edge). M_OPPOSITE Specifies that the polarity of the second edge of a stripe marker is the opposite of that of the first edge. M_POSITIVE Specifies that the polarity of the second edge is positive (rising edge). M_SAME Specifies that the polarity of the second edge of a stripe marker is the same as that of the first edge. M_SEARCH_REGION_CLIPPING Sets whether MIL can automatically clip the marker's search region, when it falls outside the image. This setting is ignored unless the search region's size is explicitly set. That is, the values specified with M_BOX_SIZE are not set to M_DEFAULT. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that the search region cannot be automatically clipped. In this case, if the search region falls outside the image, the marker cannot be found (unless you are using subregions). M_MAXIMIZE_AREA Specifies that, if the search region falls outside the image, MIL can automatically clip the region according to the best valid area in which to search, and the marker can still be found. The modified region is internally created by MIL; the actual search region that you defined is never altered. The automatically determined region must be inscribed by the defined search region, must be within the boundaries of the image, and must meet the specified M_SEARCH_REGION_CLIPPING_... conditions. MIL will not clip the region if it cannot adhere to all of these requirements. M_SEARCH_REGION_CLIPPING_MIN_AREA Sets the minimum area requirement for the clipped region that can be internally created when using M_SEARCH_REGION_CLIPPING with M_MAXIMIZE_AREA. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the minimum area required for the clipped region, in pixels. M_SEARCH_REGION_CLIPPING_MIN_HEIGHT Sets the minimum width requirement for the clipped region that can be internally created when using M_SEARCH_REGION_CLIPPING with M_MAXIMIZE_AREA. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the minimum height required for the clipped region, in pixels. M_SEARCH_REGION_CLIPPING_MIN_WIDTH Sets the minimum width requirement for the clipped region that can be internally created when using M_SEARCH_REGION_CLIPPING with M_MAXIMIZE_AREA. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0.0. Value &gt;= 0.0 Specifies the minimum width required for the clipped region, in pixels. M_SEARCH_REGION_CLIPPING_PRESERVE_CENTER Sets the center requirement for the clipped region that can be internally created when using M_SEARCH_REGION_CLIPPING with M_MAXIMIZE_AREA. All the settings are available to edge and stripe markers, but only M_DEFAULT and M_AUTO are available to circle markers. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Same as M_AUTO. M_ALONG_HEIGHT Specifies that the center, along the height of the defined search region, must be preserved in the clipped region. This setting is not available for circle markers. M_ALONG_WIDTH Specifies that the center, along the width of the defined search region, must be preserved in the clipped region. This setting is not available for circle markers. M_AUTO Specifies that MIL will determine how the center of the defined search region will be preserved in the clipped region. For edge and stripe markers, M_AUTO is the same as M_NONE. For circle markers, M_AUTO is the only possible value. M_NONE Specifies that the clipped region need not preserve the center of the defined search region. This setting is not available for circle markers. M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS Sets the units with which to interpret M_BOX_CENTER, M_BOX_ORIGIN, M_BOX_SIZE, M_BOX_ANGLE, M_BOX_ANGLE_ACCURACY, M_BOX_ANGLE_TOLERANCE, M_BOX_ANGLE_DELTA_POS, M_BOX_ANGLE_DELTA_NEG, M_RING_CENTER, M_RING_RADII, and M_SUB_REGIONS_CHORD_ANGLE. This essentially sets the input coordinate system to use. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Same as M_PIXEL. M_PIXEL Specifies to interpret the values in pixel units, according to the pixel coordinate system. M_WORLD Specifies to interpret the values in world units, according to the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, calling MmeasDraw() to draw expected marker characteristics or MmeasFindMarker() generates an error if the operation is not performed on a calibrated image. M_SUB_REGIONS_NUMBER Sets the number of sections in which to divide the search region. Since a subregion of each section is processed, this number also corresponds to the number of subregions to process. For circle markers, this value will give each subregion the same area; that is, each subregion will occupy (360/M_SUB_REGIONS_NUMBER) o of the circle. For edge and stripe markers, if you specify one subregion when multiple subregions are required (for example, when using MmeasFindMarker() with M_DEFAULT, M_ANGLE, or M_LINE_EQUATION), MIL internally uses three subregions. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value. For edge and stripe markers, the default is one. For circle markers, the default is eight. 1 &lt;= Value &lt; 8 Specifies a number of sections (subregions) that can only be used for edge and stripe markers. Value &gt;= 8 Specifies a number of sections (subregions) that can be used for edge, stripe, and circle markers. M_SUBPIXEL_MODE Sets how MIL calculates subpixel positions. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Same as M_LOCAL. M_GLOBAL Specifies that MIL calculates subpixel positions based on the entire region within which the edge is found. This mode is recommended when measuring wide edges. M_LOCAL Specifies that MIL calculates subpixel positions based on the immediate neighborhood within which the edge's maximum edgevalue is found. This mode offers more precision, but can be less stable with wide edges. For M_EDGE and M_STRIPE markers, the CharacteristicToSet and corresponding FirstValue and SecondValue parameters can be set to the following. Note that the SecondValue parameter should be set to M_NULL if no parameter setting is required. For M_EDGE and M_STRIPE markers CharacteristicToSet Description FirstValue SecondValue M_BOX_ANGLE Sets the angle of the box search region. The center of rotation of the box search region is set with M_BOX_ANGLE_REFERENCE. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0°. M_ANY Specifies that the content of the box search region is analyzed to automatically determine the angle of the marker. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 360 Specifies the angle of the box search region, in degrees, in the units of the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS. An angle interpreted using the pixel coordinate system is always measured counter-clockwise. For information on the angle's direction of rotation when interpreting the angle according to the relative coordinate system, see the Angle convention in MIL subsection of the Working with real-world units section of Chapter 28: Calibrating your camera setup. M_BOX_ANGLE_ACCURACY Sets the accuracy of the angular search. This determines the size of the step angle to use once the approximate location of the marker is found. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies the angle of accuracy to be equal to the angle of tolerance. 0.1 &lt;= Value &lt;= 180.0 Specifies the accuracy of the angular search, in degrees, in the units of the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS. M_BOX_ANGLE_DELTA_NEG Sets the negative range of angles within which to search for the marker. The search is performed between the range of angles defined by: (M_BOX_ANGLE - M_BOX_ANGLE_DELTA_NEG) to (M_BOX_ANGLE + M_BOX_ANGLE_DELTA_POS), inclusively, starting with an angle closest to that of M_BOX_ANGLE. Note that the search region must fit entirely inside the target image, unless subregions are used or clipping is enabled. If don't use subregions or enable clipping, and you choose a location, size, or search angle that causes the box to extend beyond the edge of the target image, the marker cannot be found (MmeasGetResult() with M_VALID_FLAG will return M_FALSE). FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default negative range of angles, in degrees. For a symmetrical stripe marker (a marker set with M_OPPOSITE), the default is 180.0. For an edge marker or a non-symmetrical stripe marker, the default is 360.0. 0.1 &lt;= Value &lt;= 360.0 Specifies the negative range of angles, in degrees, in the units of the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS. M_BOX_ANGLE_DELTA_POS Sets the positive range of angles within which to search for the marker. The search is performed between the range of angles defined by: (M_BOX_ANGLE - M_BOX_ANGLE_DELTA_NEG) to (M_BOX_ANGLE + M_BOX_ANGLE_DELTA_POS), inclusively, starting with an angle closest to that of M_BOX_ANGLE. Note that the search region must fit entirely inside the target image, unless subregions are used or clipping is enabled. If don't use subregions or enable clipping, and you choose a location, size, or search angle that causes the box to extend beyond the edge of the target image, the marker cannot be found (MmeasGetResult() with M_VALID_FLAG will return M_FALSE). FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default positive range of angles, in degrees. For a symmetrical stripe marker (a marker set with M_OPPOSITE), the default is 180.0. For an edge marker or a non-symmetrical stripe marker, the default is 360.0. 0.1 &lt;= Value &lt;= 360.0 Specifies the positive range of angles, in degrees, in the units of the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS. M_BOX_ANGLE_MODE Enables the use of multiple-angle search, as specified by the settings of other M_BOX_ANGLE... characteristics. The angle of the marker with the highest match score is returned. For an edge marker, this is the score of the edge, and for a stripe marker, this is the mean score of the edges. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that the search should only be performed at the angle specified by M_BOX_ANGLE. M_ENABLE Specifies that multiple-angle search is enabled. M_BOX_ANGLE_REFERENCE Sets the center of rotation to use when M_BOX_ANGLE is not zero. Note that the search region must fit entirely inside the target image, unless subregions are used or clipping is enabled. If don't use subregions or enable clipping, and you choose a location, size, or search angle that causes the box to extend beyond the edge of the target image, the marker cannot be found (MmeasGetResult() with M_VALID_FLAG will return M_FALSE). FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Same as M_BOX_CENTER. M_BOX_CENTER Specifies the center of the box search region as the center of rotation. Use the M_BOX_CENTER characteristic to set the coordinates of the center of the box search region. M_BOX_ORIGIN Specifies the top-left corner of the box search region as the center of rotation. Use the M_BOX_ORIGIN characteristic to set the coordinates of the top-left corner of the box search region. M_BOX_ANGLE_TOLERANCE Sets the rotation tolerance of the marker. This is the full range of degrees within which a marker can be rotated from a box search region that is at a specific angle and still be found. This determines the step angle used for a multiple-angle search. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 5.0. 0.1 &lt;= Value &lt;= 360.0 Specifies the rotation tolerance, in degrees, in the units of the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS. M_BOX_CENTER Sets the coordinates of the center of the box search region. Note that the search region must fit entirely inside the target image, unless subregions are used or clipping is enabled. If don't use subregions or enable clipping, and you choose a location, size, or search angle that causes the box to extend beyond the edge of the target image, the marker cannot be found (MmeasGetResult() with M_VALID_FLAG will return M_FALSE). When you change M_BOX_CENTER, MIL recalculates M_BOX_ORIGIN, relative to the new center position. FirstValue Specifies the X-coordinate of the center of the box search region. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default X-coordinate of the center of the box search region. This depends on the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS. If using pixel units, the default center is the center of the pixel coordinate system. If using world units, the default center is the origin of the relative coordinate system. Value Specifies the X-coordinate of the center of the box search region, in the units of the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS. SecondValue Specifies the Y-coordinate of the center of the box search region. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default Y-coordinate of the center of the box search region. This depends on the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS. If using pixel units, the default center is the center of the pixel coordinate system. If using world units, the default center is the origin of the relative coordinate system. Value Specifies the Y-coordinate of the center of the box search region, in the units of the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS. M_BOX_ORIGIN Sets the coordinates of the top-left corner of the box search region. Note that the search region must fit entirely inside the target image, unless subregions are used or clipping is enabled. If don't use subregions or enable clipping, and you choose a location, size, or search angle that causes the box to extend beyond the edge of the target image, the marker cannot be found (MmeasGetResult() with M_VALID_FLAG will return M_FALSE). When you change M_BOX_ORIGIN, MIL recalculates M_BOX_CENTER, relative to the new box origin. FirstValue Specifies the X-coordinate of the origin of the box search region. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default X-coordinate of the origin of the box search region. The default origin is the origin of the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS. Value Specifies the X-coordinate of the origin of the box search region, in the units of the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS. SecondValue Specifies the Y-coordinate of the origin of the box search region. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default Y-coordinate of the origin of the box search region. The default origin is the origin of the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS. Value Specifies the Y-coordinate of the origin of the box search region, in the units of the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS. M_BOX_SIZE Sets the width and height of the box search region. If M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS is set to M_WORLD, the Measurement module uses the world dimensions specified to estimate a rectangular box in pixel units. The module will then use this approximation for internal calculations. Note that the search region must fit entirely inside the target image, unless subregions are used or clipping is enabled. If don't use subregions or enable clipping, and you choose a location, size, or search angle that causes the box to extend beyond the edge of the target image, the marker cannot be found (MmeasGetResult() with M_VALID_FLAG will return M_FALSE). When you set the width and height of the search region, the search region expands or shrinks with respect to its origin, set with M_BOX_ORIGIN. When the width or height changes, MIL recalculates M_BOX_CENTER, relative to the box search region's origin. Note that if you have enabled clipping, the size of the box search region internally use might be smaller than the specified size. This is only a temporary effect; it does not change the specified size. For more information, see the Search region section of Chapter 19: Measurement. FirstValue Specifies the width of the box search region. M_DEFAULT Specifies to use the width of the entire target image. If you specify M_DEFAULT, and M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS is set to M_WORLD, you must also set the SecondValue parameter to M_DEFAULT; otherwise, an error will occur. Value Specifies the width of the box search region within the target image, in the units of the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS. This value must be positive. SecondValue Specifies the height of the box search region. M_DEFAULT Specifies to use the height of the entire target image. If you specify M_DEFAULT, and M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS is set to M_WORLD, you must also set the FirstValue parameter to M_DEFAULT; otherwise, an error will occur. Value Specifies the height of the box search region within the target image, in the units of the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS. This value must be positive. M_DRAW_PROFILE_SCALE_OFFSET Sets the scale and offset to use when drawing the edge profile or edgevalue characteristics using MmeasDraw() with M_DRAW_EDGES_PROFILE, M_DRAW_EDGEVALUE_MIN_IN_PROFILE, M_DRAW_EDGEVALUE_PEAK_WIDTH_IN_PROFILE, or M_DRAW_POSITION_IN_PROFILE. FirstValue Sets the scale to use when drawing. The shape and proportions of the drawing are kept the same; only the size is affected. This can be useful for applications where the information being drawn is too small or too large to see clearly. M_AUTO_SCALE_PROFILE Specifies to automatically compute the greatest scale factor that will fit the entire drawing within the destination buffer (or within the area that corresponds to the search region, if M_DRAW_IN_BOX is combined when drawing) after the offset has been applied. This is the default value. Value &gt; 0.0 Specifies the scale multiplier. SecondValue Sets the offset at which to draw the information from the middle of the height of the destination buffer or the area corresponding to the search region. The shape and proportions of the drawing are kept the same; only the location is affected. The middle is described as the center height of the image buffer or the profile's associated search region, and is at an offset of 0. M_AUTO_OFFSET_PROFILE Specifies to automatically compute the offset such that the maximum and minimum of the drawing are touching the ends of the destination buffer (or the area that corresponds to the search region, if M_DRAW_IN_BOX is combined when drawing). This value can only be used when FirstValue is set to M_AUTO_SCALE_PROFILE. Note that this value is optimized for M_DRAW_EDGES_PROFILE. Using M_AUTO_OFFSET_PROFILE with other M_DRAW_..._PROFILE values might draw outside of the destination (image buffer or the area corresponding to the search region). This is the default value. Value Specifies the offset from the middle of the height of the destination buffer or the area corresponding to the search region. The ends of the destination buffer or the area corresponding to the search region correspond to offsets -100 and 100. There is no limit to the offset value. However, large values might cause the required drawing to be drawn outside the visible area. M_NUMBER_MIN Sets the minimum number of edges or stripes to locate in the box search region. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value. The default number of edges or stripes is the same as the value set in M_NUMBER. Value Specifies the minimum number of edges or stripes to locate. M_ORIENTATION Sets the orientation of the edge or stripe marker. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Same as M_VERTICAL. M_ANY Specifies that the orientation of the marker is unknown; both horizontal and vertical orientations are searched. M_HORIZONTAL Specifies that the marker has a horizontal orientation. M_VERTICAL Specifies that the marker has a vertical orientation. M_SEARCH_REGION_ANGLE_INTERPOLATION_MODE Sets the type of interpolation to use when searching for markers. This only has an effect when either M_BOX_ANGLE_MODE is enabled or M_BOX_ANGLE is set to a value other than 0. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Same as M_BILINEAR. M_BICUBIC Specifies bicubic interpolation. The new value is determined by taking a weighted average of the 16 values (4x4) that surround the source point. Note that the sum of the weights used for bicubic interpolation might be greater than one. If this occurs and the result reflects an overflow or underflow, the result is saturated. M_BILINEAR Specifies bilinear interpolation. The new value is determined by taking a weighted average of the 4 values (2x2) that surround the source point. M_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR Specifies nearest neighbor interpolation. The new value is that of the pixel closest to the source point. M_SUB_REGIONS_OFFSET Sets the offset of the subregions, from the center point of each of their sections. Specify the offset as a percentage of the distance from the center point of the section to the maximum possible offset in each section. 100 corresponds to the maximum possible offset. The direction of the offset (X or Y) is taken from M_ORIENTATION, with positive values shifting the subregion down or to the right, and negative values shifting up or to the left. Note that subregions are offset as a group. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0. -100 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100 Specifies the offset of the subregions. M_SUB_REGIONS_SIZE Sets the size of the subregions, as a percentage of their section. Subregions are always rectangular and extend from one edge of the box search region to the other in the orientation direction. If made smaller than their section, the subregions become thinner and occupy the specified percentage of their section. In this case, subregions will remain centered unless moved with M_SUB_REGIONS_OFFSET. Note that the size of subregions are set as a group. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 100%. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100 Specifies the size of the subregions, as a percentage. If the size is set to 100, subregions will be evenly distributed within the box search region, with no space between them. For M_POINT markers only, the CharacteristicToSet and corresponding FirstValue and SecondValue parameters can be set to the following. Note that the SecondValue parameter should be set to M_NULL if no parameter setting is required. For M_POINT markers CharacteristicToSet Description FirstValue SecondValue M_MULTIPLE_POINT_ANGLE Sets the angle at which subsequent points are placed, in a theoretical line, for a multiple point marker (at the interval set with M_SPACING and proceeding from the coordinates defined by M_POSITION). FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 0°. 0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 360 Specifies the angle for a multiple point marker, in degrees, in the units of the input coordinate system specified using M_POINT_INPUT_UNITS. An angle interpreted according to the pixel coordinate system is always measured counter-clockwise. For information on the angle's direction of rotation when interpreting the angle according to the relative coordinate system, see the Angle convention in MIL subsection of the Working with real-world units section of Chapter 28: Calibrating your camera setup. M_POINT_INPUT_UNITS Sets the units with which to interpret M_POSITION, M_SPACING, and M_MULTIPLE_POINT_ANGLE. This essentially sets the input coordinate system to use. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Same as M_PIXEL. M_PIXEL Specifies to interpret the values in pixel units, according to the pixel coordinate system. M_WORLD Specifies to interpret the values in world units, according to the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, calling MmeasDraw() to draw expected marker characteristics generates an error if the operation is not performed on a calibrated image. M_POSITION Sets the coordinates of a point marker. For a multiple point marker, this defines the position of the first point. FirstValue Specifies the X-coordinate of the point marker. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ANY. M_ANY Specifies that the position is invalid. When a point marker is allocated, M_POSITION is set to M_ANY. After allocation, you must explicitly set a position (X-coordinate, Y-coordinate); otherwise, an error will occur.

M_ANY Specifies that the spacing is invalid. When a point marker is allocated, M_SPACING is set to M_ANY. After allocation, you must explicitly set the spacing; otherwise, an error will occur. Value Specifies the spacing, in the units of the input coordinate system specified using M_POINT_INPUT_UNITS. For M_STRIPE markers only, the CharacteristicToSet and corresponding FirstValue and SecondValue parameters can be set to the following. Note that the SecondValue parameter should be set to M_NULL if no parameter setting is required. For M_STRIPE markers CharacteristicToSet Description FirstValue SecondValue M_INCLUSION_POINT Sets a position (inclusion point) in the target image that must either be included or not included in the stripe marker found, depending on M_INCLUSION_POINT_INSIDE_STRIPE. If you specify an inclusion point, you must also set M_INCLUSION_POINT_INSIDE_STRIPE to M_YES or M_NO; otherwise, the specified inclusion point is ignored. FirstValue Specifies the X-coordinate of the inclusion point. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ANY. M_ANY Specifies no inclusion point. In this case, M_INCLUSION_POINT_INSIDE_STRIPE is ignored. Value Specifies the inclusion point's X-coordinate, in the units of the input coordinate system specified using M_INCLUSION_POINT_INPUT_UNITS. SecondValue Specifies the Y-coordinate of the inclusion point. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ANY. M_ANY Specifies no inclusion point. In this case, M_INCLUSION_POINT_INSIDE_STRIPE is ignored. Value Specifies the inclusion point's Y-coordinate, in the units of the input coordinate system specified using M_INCLUSION_POINT_INPUT_UNITS. M_INCLUSION_POINT_INPUT_UNITS Sets the units with which to interpret M_INCLUSION_POINT. This essentially sets the input coordinate system to use. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Same as M_PIXEL. M_PIXEL Specifies to interpret the value in pixel units, according to the pixel coordinate system. M_WORLD Specifies to interpret the value in world units, according to the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, calling MmeasDraw() to draw expected marker characteristics or MmeasFindMarker() generates an error if the operation is not performed on a calibrated image. M_INCLUSION_POINT_INSIDE_STRIPE Sets whether the stripe marker found must contain the inclusion point (M_INCLUSION_POINT). FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Same as M_ANY. M_ANY Specifies that M_INCLUSION_POINT is ignored. M_NO Specifies that only stripes that have the inclusion point falling outside its two outer edges can be found. M_YES Specifies that only stripes that have the inclusion point falling between its two outer edges can be found. For M_CIRCLE markers only, the CharacteristicToSet and corresponding FirstValue and SecondValue parameters can be set to the following. Note that the SecondValue parameter should be set to M_NULL if no parameter setting is required. For M_CIRCLE markers CharacteristicToSet Description FirstValue SecondValue M_CIRCLE_ACCURACY Sets the accuracy of the circle's fit operation. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Same as M_HIGH. M_HIGH Specifies that the circle's fit operation will be performed with high accuracy. This typically takes longer than low accuracy, but can produce more precise results. M_LOW Specifies that the circle's fit operation will be performed with low accuracy. This is typically faster than high accuracy, but can produce less precise results, particularly with noisy or badly contrasted images. M_CIRCLE_INSIDE_SEARCH_REGION Sets whether the circle's fit operation can result in a circle that is outside the ring search region. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Same as M_DISABLE. M_DISABLE Specifies that the circle's fit operation can result in a circle that is outside the ring search region. M_ENABLE Specifies that the circle's fit operation cannot result in a circle that is outside the ring search region. M_RING_CENTER Sets the coordinates of the center of the ring search region. The ring's center is considered to be its position. Note that at least three valid subregions must be within the target image for the circle marker to be found (even if clipping is enabled). FirstValue Specifies the X-coordinate of the center of the ring search region. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default X-coordinate of the center of the ring search region. This depends on the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS. If using pixel units, the default center is the center of the pixel coordinate system. If using world units, the default center is the origin of the relative coordinate system. Value Specifies the X-coordinate of the center of the ring search region, in the units of the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS. SecondValue Specifies the Y-coordinate of the center of the ring search region. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default Y-coordinate of the center of the ring search region.

Value Specifies the Y-coordinate of the center of the ring search region, in the units of the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS. M_RING_RADII Sets the inner and outer radius of the ring search region. The radii values are set according to the region's center (M_RING_CENTER). The inner and outer radius must be set concurrently. The inner radius must be less than the outer radius; this creates a ring within which the circle must be found. FirstValue Specifies the inner radius of the ring search region. M_DEFAULT Specifies an inner radius of 0.0. If the outer radius is set to M_DEFAULT, the inner radius must also be set to M_DEFAULT; otherwise, an error will occur. Value &gt;= 0 Specifies the inner radius, relative to the center of the ring search region, in the units specified using M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS. SecondValue Specifies the outer radius of the ring search region. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default outer radius. This value corresponds to either half the target image's width (X-size x 0.5) or half its height (Y-size x 0.5), depending on which is smaller. Note that if the outer radius is set to M_DEFAULT, the inner radius must also be set to M_DEFAULT; otherwise, an error will occur. Value &gt; Inner radius Specifies the outer radius, relative to the center of the ring search region, in the units specified using M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS. M_SUB_REGIONS_CHORD_ANGLE Sets the angle with which to set the ring search region's outer ring segment (chord). The projection of this chord segment determines the dimension of the rectangular subregion that is perpendicular to radial direction. FirstValue Specifies one of the following. M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 10.0 degrees. 0.0 &lt; Value &lt;= 45.0 Specifies the angle, in degrees, in the units of the input coordinate system specified using M_SEARCH_REGION_INPUT_UNITS. An angle interpreted according to the pixel coordinate system is always measured counter-clockwise. For information on the angle's direction of rotation when interpreting the angle according to the relative coordinate system, see the Angle convention in MIL subsection of the Working with real-world units section of Chapter 28: Calibrating your camera setup.

Syntax void MmeasSetScore( MIL_ID&nbsp;MarkerId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Characteristic, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Min, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Low, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;High, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Max, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;ScoreOffset, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;InputUnits, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag //in ) Description This function sets a score characteristic of a marker. MIL uses score characteristics to determine the best edge, stripe, or circle marker. This function only processes markers that have all the essential characteristics specified with MmeasSetMarker(). Unlike essential characteristics, which are either met or not, score characteristics can have a range of acceptable values; based on where the actual characteristic result falls within these specified limits, MIL calculates the characteristic's score. To calculate the final score of the marker itself (MmeasGetResult() with M_SCORE_TOTAL), MIL multiplies the score of all the marker's score characteristics. The marker with the highest final score is the one located by MmeasFindMarker(). To retrieve the characteristic's score, as well as other related information, such as the actual value of the characteristic (for example, the contrast of the marker in the image), you can use MmeasGetScore() with M_RESULT (after calling MmeasFindMarker()). To inquire the specified settings for a score characteristic, use MmeasGetScore() with M_MARKER. To set the acceptable limits of a score characteristic, use the Min, Low, High, and Max parameters. The values for these parameters must adhere to the following conditions: Min &lt;= Low &lt;= High &lt;= Max . If these conditions are not met, MIL generates an error. Characteristics that are greater than or equal to Low and less than or equal to High receive a score of 100%, while those that are greater than or equal to Min and less than Low, or greater than High and less than or equal to Max, receive a score above 0% and below 100%. Characteristics that are less than Min or greater than Max receive a score of 0% and are discarded. You can set all limits except Min to M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE, which represents a predetermined maximum established by MIL for that characteristic (the smallest possible value for any characteristic is always 0). Once a limit has been set to M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE, all subsequent limits must also be set to M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE. For example, if you are using M_EDGE_CONTRAST_SCORE, and set the Low parameter to M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE, you must also set the High and Max parameters to M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE. By default, MIL only calculates the score of the marker's edge strength (M_STRENGTH_SCORE); therefore, the marker with the highest edgevalue (and all the essential characteristics) is found. When using another score characteristic to find the best marker, you might want to ignore the strength characteristic, to avoid its multiplicative influence. To do so, specify M_STRENGTH_SCORE and set Min and Low to 0, and set High and Max to M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE. You can reduce the influence of a characteristic on the total score by using a score offset. MIL calculates the lowest-possible nonzero score by subtracting the specified score-offset from 100% (100% - ScoreOffset = LowestPossibleScore). Since characteristics can, by default, score above 0%, the default score-offset is equivalent to 100% (calculated as, 100% - 100% = 0%). Unless you are developing an advanced application, the default is typically appropriate. Values below Min and above Max are set to 0, whereas values between Min and Low are mapped to scores between this LowestPossibleScore and 100%, and values between High and Max are mapped to scores between 100% and this LowestPossibleScore. Parameters Parameters MarkerId Specifies the identifier of the measurement marker for which to set the score characteristic. Characteristic Specifies the score characteristic to set. The values in the table below are for specifying a score characteristic for an edge, stripe, or circle marker. For specifying a score characteristic for an edge, stripe, or circle marker Value Description M_EDGE_CONTRAST_SCORE Specifies that MIL must calculate a score, as a percentage, based on the grayscale difference between the start and end of the intensity transition from which the marker's edge is established. To retrieve the start and end of the intensity transition, use MmeasGetResult() with M_EDGE_START and M_EDGE_END. The theoretical limit of the greatest possible contrast value (M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE) depends on the target image. For example, for an 8-bit image, the greatest possible contrast is 255. M_EDGEVALUE_PEAK_CONTRAST_SCORE Specifies that MIL must calculate a score, as a percentage, based on the grayscale difference of the intensity transition between the first zero edgevalues on both sides of the established edge peak. To retrieve the minimum and maximum position of the edge peak, use MmeasGetResult() with M_EDGEVALUE_PEAK_POS_MIN and M_EDGEVALUE_PEAK_POS_MAX. Note that some search regions might never have a zero edgevalue; in which case, you should use M_EDGE_CONTRAST_SCORE for a more meaningful result. The theoretical limit of the greatest possible contrast value (M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE) depends on the target image. For example, for an 8-bit image, the greatest possible contrast is 255; this corresponds to an edgevalue of 100. M_STRENGTH_SCORE Specifies that MIL must calculate a score, as a percentage, based on the mean edgevalue (strength) of the marker. The theoretical limit of the greatest possible edgevalue (M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE) is 100. The values in the table below are for specifying a score characteristic for an edge or stripe marker. For specifying a score characteristic for an edge or stripe marker Value Description M_DISTANCE_FROM_BOX_ORIGIN_SCORE Specifies that MIL must calculate a score, as a percentage, based on the distance between the position of the box search region's origin and the position of the marker. The theoretical limit of the greatest possible position-offset (M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE) depends on the relevant dimension of the box search region (either the box's width or height, depending on the orientation). For a multiple-occurrence marker, each occurrence must respect the specified limits; otherwise MIL discards the marker. M_SPACING_SCORE Specifies that MIL must calculate a score, as a percentage, based on the typical distance (spacing) between consecutive edge or stripe occurrences of a multiple-occurrence marker. The theoretical limit of the greatest possible spacing value (M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE) depends on the relevant dimension of the box search region (either the box's width or height, depending on the orientation). The values in the table below are for specifying a score characteristic for a stripe marker. For specifying a score characteristic for a stripe marker Value Description M_EDGE_INSIDE_SCORE Specifies that MIL must calculate a score, as a percentage, based on the number of edges inside a stripe marker. The theoretical limit of the greatest possible number of edges (M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE) is equivalent to half the relevant dimension of the box search region (either 0.5 x BoxWidth or 0.5 x BoxHeight, depending on the orientation). M_STRIPE_WIDTH_SCORE Specifies that MIL must calculate a score, as a percentage, based on the distance (width) between the stripe's two outermost edges. The theoretical limit of the greatest possible width value for the stripe (M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE) depends on the relevant dimension of the box search region (either the box's width or height, depending on the orientation). The values in the table below are for specifying a score characteristic for a circle marker. For specifying a score characteristic for a circle marker Value Description M_RADIUS_SCORE Specifies that MIL must calculate a score, as a percentage, based on the linear distance between the circle's center and its circumference (radius). The theoretical limit of the greatest possible radius value for the circle (M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE) is the length of the outer radius specified for the ring search region using MmeasSetMarker() with M_RING_RADII. Min Specifies the minimum limit, which MIL uses to calculate the characteristic's score. Any value less than the minimum limit receives a score of 0%. For M_STRENGTH_SCORE, this value is set to 0 by default. For specifying the minimum acceptable limit Value Description 0 &lt;= Value &lt; Low Specifies the minimum acceptable limit. The default value is 0.0. Low Specifies the low limit, which MIL uses to calculate the characteristic's score. Any value less than the lowest limit and greater than or equal to the minimum limit receives a score above 0% and below 100%, while any value greater than or equal to the lowest limit and less than or equal to the highest limit receives a score of 100%. For M_STRENGTH_SCORE, this value is set to M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE by default. For specifying the low acceptable limit Value Description M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE Specifies that the low acceptable limit is equivalent to the greatest possible value. Min &lt;= Value &lt;= High Specifies the low acceptable limit. The default value is 0.0. High Specifies the high limit, which MIL uses to calculate the characteristic's score. Any value greater than the highest limit and less than or equal to the maximum limit receives a score above 0% and below 100%. For M_STRENGTH_SCORE, this value is set to M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE by default. For specifying the high acceptable limit Value Description M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE Specifies that the high acceptable limit is equivalent to the greatest possible value. This is the default value. Low &lt;= Value &lt;= Max Specifies the high acceptable limit. Max Specifies the maximum limit, which MIL uses to calculate the characteristic's score. Any value greater than the maximum limit receives a score of 0%. For M_STRENGTH_SCORE, this value is set to M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE by default. For specifying the maximum acceptable limit Value Description M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE Specifies that the maximum acceptable limit is equivalent to the greatest possible value. This is the default value. High &lt;= Value &lt;= M_MAX_POSSIBLE_VALUE Specifies the maximum acceptable limit. ScoreOffset Specifies the characteristic's score-offset. This allows you to indirectly specify the lowest non-zero score that a characteristic can receive. The measurement module subtracts the score-offset from 100% to establish the lowest possible score assigned to values between Min and above Max and values between Min and Low. For specifying the score-offset Value Description M_DEFAULT Specifies the default value; the default value is 100.0%. This means that the lowest possible score is 0 (100%-100%=0). 0.0 &lt;= Value &lt;= 100.0 Specifies the score-offset, as a percentage. InputUnits Specifies the units with which to interpret the Min, Low, High, and Max parameter values, when applicable. This essentially sets the input coordinate system to use. You must set this parameter to M_DEFAULT for the following score characteristics: M_EDGE_CONTRAST_SCORE, M_EDGEVALUE_PEAK_CONTRAST_SCORE, M_EDGE_INSIDE_SCORE, and M_STRENGTH_SCORE. In these cases, M_DEFAULT indicates that the input unit information is not required. For specifying the input units Value Description M_DEFAULT Same as M_PIXEL, if the score characteristic's settings are affected by input units. Otherwise, M_DEFAULT specifies that the input unit information should be ignored. M_PIXEL Specifies that the values will be interpreted in pixel units, with respect to the pixel coordinate system. M_WORLD Specifies that the values will be interpreted in world units, with respect to the relative coordinate system. If world units are specified, calling MmeasFindMarker() generates an error if the operation is not performed on a calibrated image. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion and must be set to M_DEFAULT. Compilation information Header Include mil.h. Library Use mil.lib; milmeas.lib. DLL Requires mil.dll; milmeas.dll.

Syntax void MmeasStream( MIL_TEXT_PTR&nbsp;MemPtrOrFileName, //in-out MIL_ID&nbsp;SysId, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;Operation, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;StreamType, //in MIL_DOUBLE&nbsp;Version, //in MIL_INT64&nbsp;ControlFlag, //in MIL_ID&nbsp;*MarkerIdPtr, //in-out MIL_INT&nbsp;*SizeByteVarPtr //out ) Description This function can load, restore, or save a marker from/to a file or memory stream. To inquire the number of bytes necessary to save a marker to memory stream, you should first call this function (MmeasStream()) with M_INQUIRE_SIZE_BYTE. The content saved to memory stream is equivalent to the content saved to file. This function is equivalent to a file saved using MmeasSaveMarker(). You can use this and other MIL stream functions, for example, to save all required MIL objects, as well as any other custom data, for your application to a memory stream. Once in a memory stream, you can write the stream to a single file or transfer it over a network. You are responsible for concatenating the streams and for saving the stream to file. All the marker characteristics that were in effect when the marker was saved are restored. This function can also save an allocated marker, including all its characteristics, to a specified file or memory stream. Using MmeasStream(), you can choose to save a backwards-compatible version of the marker object, which will work using a version of MIL that is up to one major release older than the current version (depending on which version is specified). For example, if you allocate a marker object using MIL 10.0 and save it to version 9.0, you can restore this object on a computer where MIL 9.0 is installed. However, all settings and features unique to the higher version will be ignored when restored using the lower version. Besides saving backwards-compatible versions, you can also load or restore marker objects saved using MIL version 7.0 with Processing Pack 1 or above. Settings that do not exist in the lower version will be filled with default values when the marker object is loaded or restored. Parameters Parameters MemPtrOrFileName Accepts the address of one of the following (see the Parameter associations section for specifics on which is expected): MIL_TEXT_PTR [optionally, in C++: a reference to a MIL_STRING] Optionally, in C++: a reference to a std::vector of type MIL_UINT8 Specifies the file or memory stream. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be returned/specified. SysId Specifies the system on which to restore the measurement marker. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. Operation Specifies the operation to perform on the measurement marker. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. StreamType Specifies the type of stream in which to store/from which to restore the measurement marker. This parameter must be set to one of the following values: For specifying the stream that holds the measurement marker Value Description M_FILE Specifies a file stream. M_MEMORY Specifies a memory stream. You are responsible for allocating a block of memory for the stream. Version Specifies the MIL version of the marker object. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be specified. ControlFlag Reserved for future expansion. This parameter must be set to M_DEFAULT. MarkerIdPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write or from which to read the identifier of the marker. See the Parameter associations section for possible values that can be returned/specified. SizeByteVarPtr Specifies the address of the variable in which to write the size of the measurement marker, in bytes. If the size is not required, you can set this parameter to M_NULL. Note that the size of a measurement marker will vary depending on the MIL version specified.
